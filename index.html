Facebook’s parent company Meta is heading into another political battle over the planned introduction of end-to-end encryption (E2EE) in its Messenger chat platform. The UK’s home secretary, Priti Patel, makes this clear in an op-ed for Tory mouthpiece The Telegraph this week, saying it would be a “grotesque betrayal” if the company didn’t consider issues of child safety while introducing E2EE. Similar arguments are likely to be raised in the US, too. 
Meta has been working on adding E2EE to Messenger for years, and recently confirmed that it aims to encrypt all chats and calls on the platform next year. (It currently only offers E2EE on its other big chat platform, WhatsApp.) The move is reigniting decades-old debates in politics and...

                              <span>The Rehearsal, the docu-comedy TV show created by and starring Nathan Fielder, has been renewed for a second season, HBO has announced. The new came just ahead of the show’s sixth episode and season one finale on Friday night. “One more chance to get it right,” reads the Season 2 tagline, though a premiere date is missing from the announcement.
Ostensibly, the basic premise of The Rehearsal is that it’s a comedic documentary series designed to help ordinary people tackle difficult moments in their life by giving them an opportunity to rehearse it beforehand. But the show approaches this simple premise with a budget and attention to detail that can make the scope of each rehearsal feel dizzying, and the show as a whole becomes...

Along with the occasionally-glitchy premiere of House of the Dragon, HBO presented a teaser trailer of content its new owner hasn’t abruptly shelved that provided the first in-motion look of Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey playing Joel and Ellie, respectively, in its upcoming The Last of Us TV show.
Neil Druckmann — the writer and creative director of both The Last of Us games — is an executive producer of the show, and tweeted, “You ain’t seen nothing yet.”


Other content in the preview came from The Idol, Love and Death, Succession, The White Lotus, And Just Like That, Hacks, The White House Plumbers, Our Flag Means Death, but the Naughty Dog-made PlayStation franchise’s live-action TV debut is the one we’re interested in the most. In the...

                              <span>Besides unreleased and disappearing content, there have been plenty of complaints about the HBO Max streaming apps since they launched. Still, they’ve generally held up well under the stress of premieres for content like Tenet, Wonder Woman, The Matrix, or Westworld, but for HBO there may not be anything like a Game of Thrones premiere. 
Tonight’s debut of the show’s spinoff, House of the Dragon, is the first taste of a new GOT experience inside HBO Max, and while many people trying to stream the premiere episode are watching without a problem, others said the app crashed on them, or froze up once it got past the pre-show teaser trailer.
Based on reports seen on Twitter, Reddit, and elsewhere, it appears that most of the people having...

A concerned father says that after using his Android smartphone to take photos of an infection on his toddler’s groin, Google flagged the images as child sexual abuse material (CSAM), according to a report from The New York Times. The company closed his accounts and filed a report with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and spurred a police investigation, highlighting the complications of trying to tell the difference between potential abuse and an innocent photo once it becomes part of a user’s digital library, whether on their personal device or in cloud storage.
Concerns about the consequences of blurring the lines for what should be considered private were aired last year when Apple announced its Child...

Today I want to show you how you can build a blockquote component that is often used to quote third-party sources inside article, user testimonials, reviews, and more.
Let me tell you a little about the technologies that we will use to build this component.
Tailwind CSS is the most popular utility-first CSS framework that you can use to write the styles directly from your HTML without having to touch your CSS file.

Prerequisites


Welcome to troubleshooting guides for beginner’s articles, a series dedicated to help when assembling your first computer system.
NOTE: This guide was posted a few years ago but is still very useful, just keep in mind some things have changed and things like the beeps described are intended only as a guide and may not be the same as the beeps on your board makes. Also, many newer boards will have a guide in the manual telling you what your beep codes mean.
NOTE: Some CPU coolers mount with a push pin type connector, these take quite a bit of force to install. It would be better to install this type onto the motherboard before it is installed into the case so you can properly…</span>

Some time ago, speech recognition API was added to the specs and we got partial support on Chrome, Safari, Baidu, android webview, iOS safari, samsung internet and Kaios browsers (see browser support in detail).

Disclaimer: This implementation won&#x27;t work in Opera (as it doesn&#x27;t support the constructor) and also won&#x27;t work in FireFox (because it doesn&#x27;t support a single thing of it) so if you&#x27;re using one of those, I suggest you to use Chrome -or any other compatible browser- if you want to take a try.




Edit: I realised that for any reason it won&#x27;t work when embedded so here&#x27;s the link to open it directly.
The implementation I made currently supports English and Spanish just to showcase.
Quick instructions and feature overview:
Choose one of the languages from the drop down.
Hit the mic icon and it will start recording (you&#x27;ll notice a weird animation).
Once you finish a sentence it will write it down in the box.
When you want it to stop recording, simply press the mic again (animation stops).
You can also hit the box to copy the text in your clipboard.
If you want me to add support for more languages tell me in the comment sections and I&#x27;m updating it in a blink so you can test it on your own language 😁
That&#x27;s all for today, hope you enjoyed I sure did doing that</span>

Hi Everyone!. In this post, I want to share with you a little guide that will show you how to use cron jobs in a Ruby on Rails application.

A cron job is a process that is scheduled to run at a certain time (every minute, day, week, or month). On Unix systems, we can run and manage these types of processes using the cron tool. The info of the process that will run the cron tool is stored in a file called crontab.
Examples of the use of cron jobs are the following:
Generate reports. e.g, a report of daily payments from an e-commerce application.


Send reminders to users. e.g, send offer reminders from an e-commerce application.



Step 1：Install whenever gem ( https://github.com/javan/whenever )

I took a technical writing class in college where we closely studied its recommendations. The book is short and contains over 100 side-by-side comparisons of less effective and more effective writing.
Reading it made me realize that I learn well by example and comparison. I’ve long wanted to write an article that shows less effective and more effective programming approaches by comparison for those who also learn well by comparison.

Today I’m going to lay out what I’ve found to be the most important principles for writing clean code. In the first section, the examples are written in  JavaScript, but they apply to almost every language. In the second section, the examples are specific to  React.…</span>

                              <span>In my 8+ years career as a developer, consultant and recently as Cloud Architect, I have worked with companies of all scales. I have had a taste of multi national corporates, mid size product companies and startups alike. All these places have had different set of challenges, but there was always a common theme I could see everywhere. Most of these challenges were rarely related to technical complexity. These mostly had developers struggling to understand what they were supposed to produce. The architects, product managers tried hard to be precise, but despite of all the efforts the result wasn&#x27;t any different.
Looking at those scenario&#x27;s in retrospect with a trained brain; a brain that has gotten a little better at finding patterns over time, I found root cause for most of the misery poin…</span>

                              <span>If you are into software development, you&#x27;ve probably heard about microservices. They&#x27;ve acquired a lot of traction in recent years, and every major corporation is creating one.
Microservices are an innovative and very unique approach to developing application systems as a collection of small services, each performing discrete and well-defined functions and being deployed independently. They are easier to understand, easier to deploy, and can be shared across different systems. This method brings high agility to an application system and provides many opportunities for DevOps and CI/CD.

                              <span>根据 Aiven 的一份新报告，谷歌已经提高了其对开源软件的投入，并在活跃贡献者方面超过了微软。


根据 Aiven 的报告（LCTT 译注：我没有找到这份报告），谷歌目前的活跃贡献者多于微软，这要归功于对开源代码库 GitHub 的每月提交量同比增长 20%。根据开源贡献者指数（OCSI）的数据，谷歌 7 月份有 5421 名活跃贡献者，而微软的活跃贡献者为 5268 名。

Aiven 联合创始人兼首席技术官 Heikki Nousiainen 说，谷歌超过微软“特别令人惊讶”。

“这其中的一个因素是微软对开源项目的提交逐年下降，”Nousiainen 说，“然而，微软对开发者自由和创新的投入是一致的，该公司是开源的主要参与者，甚至在 2018 年收购了 GitHub。”

Aiven 指出，亚马逊已经开始更加重视开源计划，其对 OpenSearch（ElasticSearch 的复刻）的支持以及 GitHub 上项目数量的增加就是证明。Nousiainen 认为，亚马逊对 OpenSearch 和 ElasticSearch 的支持代表了“该公司方向的重大改变”，以及对重大开源项目掌舵的愿望。据 Aiven 介绍，这些科技巨头正在迅速扩大对开源软件的使用。根据数据，现在来自亚马逊、微软和谷歌的活跃 GitHub 贡献者比六年前多了 300%。

“这项研究的总体信息是积极的，”Nousiainen 说，“在开源社区有大量的创新在继续发生，其结果使我们所有人受益。数不清的人正在为其他人树立一个榜样。”

                              <span>每年，我们都会讨论 Linux 桌面年。当我们看到操作系统在消费者领域的市场份额有所增加时，却知道是无望的。




当然，Linux 主导着整个云行业（Web 托管、云计算、数据仓库等）。在这里，我们只关注桌面 Linux 的市场份额。

如果你是 Linux 世界的新手，可能不知道，Linux 不是一个操作系统，它是一个内核。但是，为了简单起见，我们倾向于将 “Linux” 称为操作系统。你可以在我们的解释文章中了解 Linux 是什么。

有朝一日，我们希望 Linux 发行版在未来的桌面操作市场份额中占据主导地位。但是，当前的趋势说明了什么？现在是 Linux 桌面年了吗？

趋势每个月都在变化。去年，与今年相比，Linux 可能市场份额更多一些。因此，跟踪最新报告至关重要。

在这里，我们试图以来自不同来源的每月更新报告的形式跟踪最新趋势。

操作系统市场份额：2022 年 7 月


我们每个月都会更新可用信息。请注意，上个月的信息将在下个月发布。因此，例如，当我们在 8 月份更新报告时，它将包括 7 月份的统计数据。


在可用的桌面操作系统（Windows、macOS 和 Chrome OS）中，Linux 通常倾向于占据第三位。

一些最新的统计数据包括：

Statista
最后更新于 2022 年 6 月
2.42%
14.64%
76.33%



另外，参与 Stack Overflow 调查 的开发者中，40.23% 的用户将基于 Linux 的操作系统用于个人用途，39.89% 的用户将其用于专业用途。

每个来源都使用不同的数据收集方法。市场份额不断变化，这就是为什么我们决定定期更新此报告，而不是单独发布关于市场份额微小变化的帖子。

总体而言，看起来 Linux 作为桌面操作系统在开发人员中很受欢迎，并最终影响游戏玩家和其他消费者作为替代操作系统。

你对这种趋势有何看法？你认为 Linux 会在桌面市场份额方面超过 macOS 吗？在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

                              <span>上周三微信派发布了《2012.8.17，微信公众平台上线了》，引发了一群公号自媒体人的集体怀旧。是啊，已经十年了。
你或多或少还能想起一些公号大V，还有以前在朋友圈刷屏的文章，那些高光时刻像浮雕一样刻在脑海，好像见证着这个平台的兴衰浮沉。
今天不考古，也不讲宏大叙事，想从个人的视角，跟你分享下我与公众号的一些故事。

我第一次知道公众号是2013年，那是大一下学期，我也刚注册微信。
彼时微博正兴，因在校园杂志上看到「糗事大百科」博主赵诚玩微博年入千万，颠覆认知，第一次看到上学-工作之外的道路。
我能不能呢？不知道，但想试试。
寒假买了第一台笔记本电脑，从此没日没夜沉浸在微博里，研究怎么涨粉、互推、发段子。
做搞笑内容半年时间，小有成就，到了5万多粉丝（没买粉），偶有广告投放赚点零花钱，我对微博的发展充满信心。
注册微信后了解到公众号，那会儿我对它是不屑一顾的，长内容、排版难看、一天就发一条、没互动，怎么看都没出路。而微博不一样，信息流、用户停留时间长、话题多、互动丰富、140字段子&amp;新闻、搞笑动图，人们更喜欢，这才是媒介发展的下一个方向。
公众号就像上个时代的博客，现在无非迁移到移动端，换汤不换药。
谁愿意拿着手机看长文呢？
2014年，我给学校一家饰品玩具店出营销主意，老板问我要不要做公众号，我坚决说不要做，耽误精力、不能实时传达，还得引导关注，太麻烦，不如加微信好友送小礼品，然后朋友圈发优惠活动。人们不看公众号，但肯定刷朋友圈，触达率更高（没想到那会儿就有私域流量的理念了）。
转变是在大二下学期，微博起色不大，发送频率高又耽误学习，而且一直发搞笑段子觉得没意义，就把号卖了。
于此同时，公众号很多优质内容开始出现，好多大V也倾向长文、深度观点输出，即便是搞笑段子，质量也比微博高一个层次。自己开始沉迷每日阅读公号，朋友圈也经常有刷屏文章，同学讨论的也是XX文章的观点，仿佛突…</span>

背景
自高中起，就有将自己的错题整理到云端的想法，可以随时随地通过手机查看，便于复习。但是限制于当时的环境，不能方便使用数字工具，此想法便不了了之。不过「笔记数字化」的念头自此萌芽。
上了大学以后，接触到了 OneNote。将有价值的「文章」、上课的笔记、PPT「搬运」到OneNote 上，像一只勤劳的小仓鼠，不断囤积「知识」。看着软件日渐增长的「占用大小」，充满了成就感。但是工作之后，慢慢发现积累的这些「知识」无法应用到生产实践当中，很多笔记可能自「搬运」进 OneNote 之后便再也没有打开过。
偶然的一次机会，听到了 flomo 创始人少楠老师关于「知识管理」的讲座 ，其中提到我再熟悉不过的一句话：

搬运是一种浪费。

作为一位工业工程专业的毕业生，「搬运浪费」作为「八大浪费」之一是学习的重点，也是工作的切入点。但是我之前只将其应用于工作的生产过程，却忽略了自己的「知识加工」过程。我突然意识到，在我原本的知识管理流程中，「搬运」占据了很大一部分，而忽略了这是极大的浪费。这种搬运不产生任何附加值，也不会加深知识在自己大脑中的印象，也就不可能在以后需要的时候轻易调用。除了浪费时间和精力，顺便满足了自己内心小小的成就感和虚荣心之外，几乎没有益处。因为从生产的角度讲，「搬运」的知识只是从工厂门口搬运到了加工车间，堆放在角落里，几乎不可能搬上生产设备，更不可能成为有价值的「产品」。
在少楠老师的推荐下，我开始接触 《卡片笔记写作法》 一书，尝试使用双链笔记工具重新打造我的「知识加工厂」。

                              <span>Welcome page, and the videos walk you through the power of the data portal.

What we call the &#x27;geo-enabled business&#x27; is a company who creates and manages data about their slice of the real world - for example, commercial real estate🏣, agriculture and farming🐖, manufacturing plants🏭, or construction projects🔨.

Companies like this are capturing more and more data every day: drone photos, mobile phone videos 📱, thermal cameras 📷, geospatial shape files, 3D and pointclouds from photogrammetry, Zoom recordings🎙about a client project, or simply Office documents and PDFs.

Via machine learning, we extract &#x27;observations&#x27; of people 👪, places ⛺ 🌁 ⛪ and things 🚁🚊🚜 in your files - into your personal knowledge graph. From this data in the knowledge graph, you can search, filter, view, analyze on a map or over time - or send alerts to Slack, send daily email summaries, or even connect via webhook to your own APIs.

Also, you can plugin machine learning APIs to extract even more information - via computer vision, text analysis or audio transcription.  We ship with some of the leading APIs out of the box (AssemblyAI, Roboflow, Primer), but you can also bring ML models that you, your company or a partner have built.

We have tons more features coming later this year, like ESRI ArcGIS integration, photogrammetry support, more data feeds and enrichments, and publishing out to other databases and platforms.

When you signup for a free 14 day trial, you&#x27;ll get 100GB of cloud storage and access to all our current features.

Try it out today at https://portal.unstruk.ai, and we look forward to hearing what you think!

                              <span>What it is and why

massCode is a snippet manager for developers that helps you conveniently organize pieces of code and have quick access to them. Multilevel folders and tags are used for organization, and each snippet has fragments for even more granular structuring. The app supports Markdown so it can be used as a notebook if needed. 

What&#x27;s New

Direct support for TextMate grammars

Now massCode uses Codemirror as the basis for the editor and &#x60;.tmLanguage&#x60; as the grammar for syntax highlighting. This tandem opens the door to over 600 existing grammars. The application currently supports more than 160 grammars. In addition to &#x60;.tmLanguage&#x60;, the application supports &#x60;.tmTheme&#x60; for themes. 

Real-time Render for HTML &amp; CSS

Now you can see the result of HTML &amp; CSS directly in the application. This is such a CodePen on minimal :)

Mermaid Diagram

Added support for [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mer...) - diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically.

Presentation Mode

massCode allows you to make a presentation out of a sequence of snippets. It&#x27;s great for classroom use, team meetings, conferences or simply reviewing notes on your own.

Screnshots

Create beautiful snippet images on different backgrounds and in different modes.

Localization

massCode is available in English, Español, Português (Brasil), Русский, 中文 (简体), 中文 (繁體), 中文 (繁體 香港特別行政區) &amp; 日本語 languages.

通过本文可快速了解：
1.为何使用 MVI
2.为何最终考虑 SharedFlow 实现
3.repeatOnLifecycle + SharedFlow 实现 MVI 思路
为何使用 MVI
MVI 是一响应式模型，通过唯一入口入参，并从唯一出口接收结果和完成响应。
换言之，通过将 States 聚合于 MVI-Model，页面根据回传结果统一完成 UI 渲染，可确保
所获 States 总是最新且来源可靠唯一
可消除 mutable 样板代码
“消除样板代码” 相信开发者深有体会。“所获 States 总是最新且来源可靠唯一”，对此存疑，故我们继续一探究竟。
MVI 原始理论模型
根据网传 MVI 理论模型，经典 MVI 模型伪代码示例如下：
data class ViewStates(
  val progress: Int,
  val btnChecked: Boolean,
  val title: String,
  val list: List,
)
​
class Model : Jetpack-ViewModel() {
  private val _states &#x3D; MutableLiveData()
  val states &#x3D; _states.asLiveData()
  fun request(intent: Intent){
    when(intent){
      is Intent.XXX -&gt; {
        DataRepository.xxx.onCallback{
          val s &#x3D; _states.getValue()
          s.progress &#x3D; it.progress

Many developers struggle with work-life balance. They are overloaded with regular tasks and frequently called upon to solve urgent customer issues. Yet many developers, like me, have ideas they want to promote if only they had time to do so. Sometimes these pet ideas do not make it through the product management feature-selection process. Other times, a developer does not have time to complete the solution end-to-end on their own, yet they know if it could somehow be implemented, the project would benefit.
This is where mentoring comes in. Mentorship has many benefits: It helps the mentee&#x27;s personal development, and it can improve the mentor&#x27;s self-c…</span>

New on the GNOME desktop is their terminal emulator application simply named Console. It seems aimed at providing a no-nonsense, stable command-line environment for Linux users.

The GNOME Console isn&#x27;t as feature-rich as a lot of other terminals, including the previous GNOME terminal, but I like it and have been using it regularly for the past few months. I enjoy the simplicity of it. I waste time in other terminal emulators configuring fonts, colors, and profiles.
Console does have some options and nice integration with the GNOME desktop. I&#x27;ll …</span>

Netflix’s upcoming ad-supported tier might not show commercials on all the content included in the cheaper subscription plan. A report from Bloomberg suggests that Netflix may cut commercials from newer original films, as well as certain kids’ shows.
According to Bloomberg, Netflix may not run ads during original movies when they’re first released, and will instead insert ads at a later date. It’s still too early to tell how long Netflix will show a newer movie without ads, but as noted by Bloomberg, this decision may help alleviate some of the concerns filmmakers might have about ads detracting from their work.
Netflix original kids’ programming will also reportedly get the ad-free treatment — just like Disney Plus plans on doing with...

Tesla’s increasing the price of its Full-Self Driving (FSD) software to $15,000. In a post on Twitter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the new price will go into effect in North America starting September 5th, representing a $3,000 jump.
Drivers who order a vehicle before September 5th won’t have to pay the newly-increased price, Musk says. The price hike comes as Tesla begins rolling out FSD beta 10.69 to drivers, a version Musk calls “a big step forward.” It’s still unclear whether Tesla plans on raising the price of its FSD subscription, which currently costs $199 per month.
After wide release of FSD Beta 10.69.2, price of FSD will rise to $15k in North America on September 5th. 
Current price will be honored for orders made...

The decades-long search for the American version of Sailor Moon has finally come to an end. Ray Mona, a YouTuber who documents her efforts to find lost media (including the never-released Mean Girls game), has managed to unearth the pilot episode of the unaired, never-finished series that the Sailor Moon fandom has come to know as Saban Moon.
The story of the Americanized Sailor Moon starts in 1993, about two years before the debut of the dubbed Sailor Moon that we know today. At the time, animation studio Toon Makers teamed up with Renaissance Atlantic Entertainment, the producers behind the original Power Rangers, in a bid to make an English version of the series. The two companies pitched a project that blends live-action with...

Bungie appears to be getting ready to add Fortnite skins to Destiny 2. After Fortnite leaker MidaRado teased a potential Destiny 2 collab over the weekend, Ginsor — a well-known Destiny dataminer — has confirmed the crossover with an image showing off several classic Fortnite skins in Destiny 2.
The image, which was likely obtained from Bungie’s own website, includes a Titan armor set that looks very much like the Black Knight skin that was originally obtainable from the season pass of Fortnite season 2. Destiny’s Warlock is also shown with a Fortnite-like Drift Mask, and the Hunter looks very much like Fortnite’s Omega skin.
It’s not clear how Destiny 2 players will be able to obtain these Fortnite skins, or when they’ll be part of the...

【写作能力提升】系列文章：
为什么建议你一定要学会写作?
手把手教你快速搞定4个职场写作场景
一、前言
Hello，我是小木箱，今天主要分享的内容是: 5种搭建⽂章架构的⽅法!
大家普遍有一个共同的疑惑——如何写作? 其实是一个很难回答的问题。因为问题比较空泛，好比别人问你怎样赚钱一样难回答。
如果问我如何写好一篇文章?需要具备的核心的技能是什么？我可能会说: 搭建框架，框架是文章的根基，能不能搭好文章的框架决定了文章的质量。
想要写好一篇文章，最先要做的便是搭建文章框架。为什么这么说呢？因为如果写文章不搭建框架，那么写作会出现以下三种情况。
二、三种情况
2.1 第⼀种情况:写着写着思路断了
第一种情况: 写着写着思路断了 ，断了也不要紧，接不回来了才尴尬。刚刚明明想得很清楚，上了个厕所，就忘了接下来应该怎么写了。
2.2 第⼆种情况:写着写着就跑题了
第二种情况: 写着写着就跑题了，写得很嗨，写得很快。一顿操作猛如虎，行云流水 30000 字，写完一看，完了，跑题了，BBQ了。
2.3 第三种情况:逻辑处理不够严谨
第三种情况: 思路也没断，也没跑题，逻辑处理的不太严谨，大大影响了内容的质量。
三、搭建文章框架
这三种情况是因为没有搭建文章框架导致的。框架是写文章时的指路灯。这条指路灯是你的逻辑。它确保你的内容不会冲出跑道，第一读者读起来没有压力，第二写的时候会更容易，所以说搭建文章框架是写作最关键的一步，那怎么搭建文章框架呢？我总结了五种搭建文章框架的方法。
3.1 时间的顺序
第一种，按照时间的顺序布局，在自媒体写作中，第一种常见的逻辑顺序是: 按照时间的顺序来写时间自带的逻辑，从昨天到今天，从今天到明天，这是时间逻辑；年终总结，从年初到年中，从年中到年终，这是时间逻辑；从过去到现在，从现在到未来，这也是时…</span>

USB “橡皮鸭子”看起来就像一个普通的 U 盘。但把它插入电脑，机器就会把它看作是一个 USB 键盘。最初的 USB “橡皮鸭子”在 10 多年前发布，成为黑客们的最爱，如创建一个假的 Windows 弹出框来获取用户的登录凭证，或使 Chrome 浏览器将所有保存的密码发送到攻击者的服务器。这些年来它也在不断更新。新的 DuckyScript 3.0 允许用户编写函数、存储变量和使用逻辑流控制，成为了一种功能丰富的语言。它还可以将数据编码为二进制格式，并通过键盘的大写锁定或数字锁定灯的闪烁作为信号，来窃取目标机器的数据。用这种方法，攻击者可以把它插上几秒钟，告诉别人：&quot;对不起，我想那个 U 盘坏了&quot;，然后把它拿回来，并保存他们所有的密码。

Copilot 将使计算机教育的编程练习变得毫无意义

有计算机教授担心 Copilot 将使传统的计算机教育的编程练习变得毫无意义，因为 Copilot 知道所有的答案。“据我所知，Copilot 在所有的入门编程作业上都接受过专门培训，Copilot 该死的喜欢编程入门作业。”虽然很多计算机编程练习可以在网上找到代码的例子，但老师也可以在谷歌上找到它们，然后用抄袭检测器将这些代码与提交的代码进行比较。而 Copilot 是不同的，它实际上产生了新颖的解决方案，在表面上有足够的不同，以至于它们看起来可能来自学生们自己写的。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：确实，这就如同使用计算器来学习初等数学，并不能真的让人学会数学。所以，计算机教育需要为 Copilot 这类 AI 工具的到来做一些准备。除了限制对 Copilot 的访问，是否还可以做更多的事情？




新的后量子密码学算法将于 2024 成为标准

上个月，由恩智浦、IBM 和 Arm 的安全专家共同编写的专门安全算法被美国 NIST 选中，成为旨在应对量子威胁的行业全球标准的一部分。NIST 宣布了这些后量子密码学算法将在 2024 年成为标准。而目前通行的 RSA 和 ECC 等密码学算法用了十多年才确定了最佳标准。

                              <span>做一个高效的、充满好奇心的问题解决者吧！这会帮助你成为一名成功的程序员。


你是否曾经遇到过这样一种情况：你想解决一个问题，并且你在 YouTube 或 Google 中找到了相关的教程。嗯，你觉得看会了，可真做起来，却止步不前，大脑一片空白。你感觉自己每一行代码都看懂了，可一旦离开了那个教程，就步履维艰。如果你在 HackerRank 或 LeetCode 上看过别人的解题过程，你就能体会到，一个有追求的程序员第一次看到这些挑战时，他会是何种感受。举例来说，假设你正在学习一门新语言，在你刚开始理解这门语言的基础知识的时候，你看了一个教程，摩拳擦掌，结果发现自己无法独立应用学到的知识，这反过来可能会导致你怀疑自己的知识和能力。

把教程付诸于实践

你应该从头开始吗？如果你这么做，你可能很快就会发现自己重复学习了很多次相同的知识点。虽然从头开始并不一定是种浪费，但是，你该如何变得更高效呢？

死记硬背在编程中完全是行不通的。话虽如此，但你也不能够忽视熟悉语法的重要性。因为，死记硬背和养成习惯之间是有明显区别的。习惯是很难打破的。要养成多使用编程语言的常规语法、函数、方法、模式、范式和构造的习惯，这样你才能掌握它。掌握一门编程语言需要大量的创造力和练习。练习语法是非常必要的，直到它们能在你的脑海中自然地浮现，就像血液在血管里流动一样。

“问题解决”的工作原理

那么，你该采取什么样的方案呢？这实际上取决于许多因素。这些因素可以是任何东西，下至技术限制，上至用户需要。世界上有无数的问题，每个问题都有许多解决方式。如何选择一个最好的？这就需要“问题解决”problem-solving的技巧了。

下面是一个简单的例子。你需要把两个数相加，让它们等于 6。显然，你有多种方式可供选择：

3 + 3 &#x3D; 6 或 4 + 2 &#x3D; 6 或 5 + 1 &#x3D; 6

同理，如果你需要让两个数字，经过一次减法、乘法或除法运算后，得到的结果为 6。你仍然有很多选项，包括：

8 - 2 &#x3D; 6 或 12 / 2 &#x3D; 6 或 3 * 2 &#x3D; 6

每种方案都有它固有的限制，且各不相同。当你在现实生活中尝试做出一个高效的方案时，你必须要考虑到所有的限制。这个方案可行吗？有什么障碍吗？有可操作性吗？是否可扩展呢？而如何最小化约束，并做出一个最优方案，就取决于问题类型和业务需要。

练习很重要

编程的目标不仅仅是解决问题。因此，从工程视角理解代码如何工作始终是一个优势。这就是代码审查在企业级开发中发挥作用的地方。编程的最低要求是具备基本的编码知识，包括语言的语法、函数和方法。归根结底，“写代码”是需要你去写的，所以练习总是有助于提高你的技能。流畅的写作和复杂方案的开发都来自于持续的学习和训练。

学习编码

我撰写和分享这篇文章，是为了鼓励新程序员去探寻自己的内心，寻找那个“优秀的问题解决者”。请不要停止相信自己。

要成功编码，你需要培养许多习惯。下面是我在学习编码时保持高效的方法：


一个包含语法、方法和函数 速查手册 总能应付不时之需。

将问题分解成更小的部分，便于追踪。

尝试理解代码运行的核心概念。

构思解决方案时，大可发挥你的创造力 —— 但刚开始还是要注重基础。

在练习时，创建尽可能多的应用和组件。

永远不要从 Stack Overflow/Exchange 等开放平台上复制/粘贴代码，特别是在不了解上下文的情况下。

跟着教程做了一遍后，尝试从头开始构建所有内容。即使你只能独立完成一半，那也仍然是一个成就。


祝我们所有人好运！

                              <span>有几十个基于 Ubuntu 的发行版可用。从 面向初学者的发行版 到 漂亮的发行版，Ubuntu 主导着 Linux 桌面空间。

如果通用发行版还不够的话，你还会发现一些 奇怪的基于 Ubuntu 的发行版。

我不打算参与 Ubuntu 与 Fedora 的辩论。我只是说如果你想在 Fedora 领域中尝试一些东西，我可以列出一些选项。

请记住，我不会列出面向服务器的 Linux 发行版。此处的列表适用于 桌面 Linux 用户。

该列表没有特定的排名顺序，并且提到的选项可能并不总是适合新用户。因此，在第一次安装任何基于 Fedora 的发行版之前，请确保你浏览了文档。

1、Fedora 定制版



Fedora 有很多定制版spin，但没有 Ubuntu 那么多。

Fedora 定制版 不是基于 Fedora 的独立发行版，而只是具有 不同桌面环境 或采用平铺窗口管理器的不同版本的 Fedora。

如果你不喜欢默认的 GNOME 桌面环境，你可以下载其中一种。

一些可用的选项是：


Fedora KDE Plasma

Fedora i3 平铺窗口管理器

Fedora LXQt

Fedora LXDE

Fedora MATE-COMPIZ

Fedora Cinnamon 版


2、Nobara



当你在找 游戏发行版 时，列表将由 Debian 和 Arch 衍生产品占据主导地位。因此，如果你正在寻找基于 Fedora 且具有相同效果的游戏发行版，那么 Nobara 就是你所需要的。

Nobara 是由 Proton GE 的维护者制作的游戏发行版，他也是 Lutris 开发团队的成员，因此你可以期待开箱即用的下一代游戏体验！

为了带来更好的体验，Nobara 在 Fedora 上预先应用…</span>

                              <span>上一讲“猛药”过去，功效性的讲解就要小小告一段落了。在护肤金字塔的第二层，只剩下了“修护”这个话题，而在金字塔的顶端，“再生”我们还有没有提到。修护与再生，代表了皮肤自身的规律，修护受损的细胞，代谢老去的废物，同时刺激新的牺牲生成。修护和再生在一门交叉学科，很难把他们分开。那么就从这里开始，让我们看看修护和再生的秘诀。
什么是修护与再生
我们的皮肤，每天都冲在第一线，帮助我们抵御外界的侵袭，所以皮肤每天都在“受伤”，修护，就是要让我们的皮肤屏障更坚挺，保证皮肤能够处于正常的工作状态。
但修护并不等同于“包扎伤口”，不是只有当皮肤已经明显受损以后才需要修护，而更像是增强免疫力，需要从日常下手，维护皮肤的健康状态。所以，修护既是我们大妈们锻炼身体的广场舞，也是医生关键时刻可以救命的手术刀。
而再生，依赖于修护，又高于修护。修护的目的就是让皮肤获得健康稳定的状态，从而促使其再生，再生依赖于修护提供好的基础，同时又在修护的基础上提供和创造新生。
修护与再生的场景
不同的情况下，我们所选择的修护方法、成分、产品也不尽相同。
日常修护
大多数时候，我们需要的都只是日常的修护，目的是让白天工作了一天的皮肤得到舒缓和放松，类似于我们每晚的睡眠，是为了让皮肤可以继续保持一个健康稳定的状态。这种情况下，并不需要使用什么猛药，只需要选择皮肤容易吸收的，温和的产品，就可以达到我们的要求。这时修护的关键词是：温和。
晒后紧急修护
紫外线对皮肤的伤害，在防晒的一讲中已经充分解读（忘记了，可以回看这里），但有时候我们难免遇到极端天气，或者一时犯懒，防晒做的不好，导致皮肤被晒伤。这时皮肤往往处于一个非常脆弱的状态，继续急速有效的镇定，来帮助皮肤迅速回到相对稳定的状态。这时修护的关键词是：极速。
过敏修护
对于敏感肌同学，经常需要面对的就是解决自己的过敏问题，当皮肤受到一些并不耐受的刺激，就会激发皮肤的自我…</span>

进度条是个好东西，在日常的工作生活中，总会有一些场景是它能大展身手的。
做项目管理时，我们能通过一个里程碑的进度条，了解其下多个任务的整体进度；做预算管理时，设置好每个类别的预算上限，进度条就能告诉我们各个类别下的预算使用情况；测评打分时，进度条也能直观展示各评分项之下，打分对象的得分情况（比如餐厅的口味、环境、服务），方便我们对比绝对值、相对值。
如果你是一名 Notion 的资深用户，可能已经早早的在 Notion 数据库中用上了进度条，但你可能不知道，Notion 最近的一项更新，让进度条对 Notion 新手变得更低门槛、触手可及了。
在这篇 Notion 进度条教程中，我将围绕此次更新的进度条功能，介绍这 4 点内容：

Notion 新推出的进度条功能
相比原有方案，新的进度条好在哪
哪些地方可以使用新进度条
如何设置进度条

希望通过这篇文章，能帮助你更好的使用 Notion、释放自己的生产力。
原生支持的新进度条
大约 4 天前，Notion 官方发布了一条推文，宣布为进度条增加了原生支持。

从原推文的动图中可见，在 Notion 的数据库中，可以根据给定的属性值生成进度条图形，并紧邻数字显示，目前有条形（Bar）、环形（Ring）这两种可选样式：
Notion 官推里，用动图演示了进度条的设置操作
我也在自己的数据库中尝试了这两种样式，数字阅读起来确实会更直观一些。
条形进度条环形进度条

                              <span>Pretty wild that TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook, &quot;when opening any website in their app, injects tracking code that can monitor all keystrokes, including passwords, and all taps.&quot;

Wild, but not unexpected.

Thanks for checking out the Stylesöm app and reading the spiel above.
So why produce Stylesöm?

This is a personal, fun passion project.  Our small team wanted to offer a quick and easy app to allow anyone to blog on-the-fly using their cellphone without the hassle of setting up a formal WP or similar account and having to purchase a domain name.

There are many well established social media apps we use, but they often don&#x27;t offer much in the way of personalization and style choice.  It&#x27;s pretty much the same white background, gridded images and videos, and tons of ads.

Stylesöm is for fun.  It&#x27;s probably not for the serious blogger who wants to gain a million…</span>

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) slapped the Sam Bankman-Fried-owned cryptocurrency exchange FTX with a cease-and-desist order over “false and misleading statements” that suggest its assets are FDIC-insured. The FDIC doesn’t cover stocks or crypto, and only safeguards funds held in insured bank accounts.
In a letter to the exchange, the FDIC points to a now-deleted tweet from FTX president Brett Harrison, which states “direct deposits from employers to FTX US are stored in individually FDIC-insured bank accounts in the users’ names.” The referenced tweet also says that “stocks are held in FDIC-insured and SIPC [Security Investor Protection Corporation]-insured brokerage accounts.” The FDIC claims this falsely represents...

                              <span>前言
理性聊车，高尔夫也很好，特斯拉也很棒，奔驰宝马大家都喜欢，在此分享一下购车的一些想法和感受，祝大家都拥有自己的爱车。
我自认从工作以来和车的缘分还是非常深的，从 4S 销售到广告策划，又因为接触大众、斯柯达更多，再到家里换了奥迪后，与其说是喜欢，不如说是对这种德系品牌的习惯。结合到家里本身有车，我的车就不需要承担「家庭重任」，可以随我喜欢。但提车后的这一个多月，这台小车让我开始强烈的感受到「家的责任」。
提车日
购车在上海上半年疫情解封之后，去到奥迪4S店，看到店里积压了较多库存，当时我自己也没有特别倾向的颜色，A3的颜色除了红色我都挺喜欢，就在库存的冰川白、探戈红、环焦蓝、纳瓦拉蓝中，选择了较深的纳瓦拉蓝，张扬的造型配一个低调内敛的颜色。中配（时尚运动）的车型上，库存车上额外增加了四门无钥匙进入（+¥2000），加上购置税减半政策，实际落地20万不到。

奢侈与吝啬的交织
20万买 A0 小车，奢侈
最开始的选车首先当然是预算，20万以内，另外优先紧凑级，SUV 或 Sedan 我并不是特别在意，但两厢车型是我比较青睐的。第八代高尔夫和 A3 Sportsback 是最后的二选一，同样的预算高尔夫可以买到顶配 R-Line 版本，拥有更多的科技配置。而 A3 在20万内，只能说配置相对实用一些，没有氛围灯、副驾驶电动座椅等等这些。
网上说的最多的，就是 A3 不过是换壳高尔夫，还要加钱。说对也对，但在做工和实际的细微体验上，还是会有所差异。其实最后更促成下单的，是展厅销售的态度，毕业那年我自己也做过汽车销售，了解一些展厅里的道道。你如果问我，是不是有虚荣心的成本，那我的答案是肯定的。

不加2万上顶配，吝啬
从升级配置来看，时尚运动与豪华运动之间，相差近2万，增加了：

30色内饰氛围灯
电动折叠后视镜，带副驾驶侧下翻
副驾驶电动座椅与多向调节
三温区空调
主驾驶1…</span>

九月将至，大一新生踏入校园的同时，大四「老油条」们也开始准备自己的毕业论文与实习工作。学年论文与毕业论文时本科生绕不过的一座大山，以下是我在大四撰写论文时积累的一些个人经验与见解，希望对学弟、学妹们的论文写作有所帮助。
电子资源
文科专业的大部分学生在本科阶段，了解学界研究会借助知网、万方数据等文献数据库。国内高校图书馆也会购买文献数据库的使用权限，方便校内教职工与学生使用。在校园网中打开图书馆的网站，找到电子资源栏目，便可以看到学校已购买的电子数据库。除了学校提供的电子资源，不少地方图书馆对当地公众与读者提供电子资源，如国家图书馆、浙江图书馆在注册后便可免费使用。

扩展阅读：《免费看论文？除了学校的图书馆，还有 ……》

当我们搜索某个领域的文献，数据库会返回不少的文章，文章的质量良莠不齐，参考文献的作用时帮助你了解研究话题的学术现状、存在问题、解决方法等，导师进行论文指导也会强调尽量挑选时间较新的「核心期刊」与「原始文献」，注重文献的权威性、专业性与时效性。在数据库搜索时，我们可以通过筛选功能，选择来自「核心期刊」的文献，如北大核心、南大核心、SCI、EI、SSCI 等期刊目录。
期刊筛选
大部分阅读与参考的文献我是从万方数据下载的，PDF 文档方便在不同的软件中阅读与文献管理，二是万方提供的 PDF 文档默认自带目录与文字图层，知网（大陆版）默认只提供 CAJ 格式的文档，缺德到家。
Word 主题样式
不少大学生在「制造学术垃圾」使用的主流写作工具是 Microsoft Word，最头疼的除了正文写作，还有学术论文的格式规范。一篇学术论文的结构大致可分为以下四大部分：封面、目录、正文以及引用。
论文结构
以我大学的《毕业论文档案打印和格式要求》为例，除去页面设置、撰写规范、字词符号用法等要求，大部分内容的格式涉及到 Word 中的字…</span>

                              <span>韦伯太空望远镜大量使用了 20 年前的一种 JavaScript 方言

根据韦伯太空望远镜的综合科学仪器模块手册，它有一堆预先写好的 JavaScript 脚本来完成特定的任务，地面上的科学家可以告诉它运行这些任务。当然，这些脚本不是运行在一个浏览器里面，而是用一个叫做“脚本处理器”的程序解释，然后它将根据脚本的要求，与其他的应用程序和系统联系。这些脚本所使用的语言是一种 JavaScript 版本 Nombas ScriptEase 5.00e，但开发它的公司已不存在，这种语言最后的版本发布于 2003 年。虽然韦伯太空望远镜是在 2021 年底发射的，但这个项目从上世纪八十年代就开始了，而建设在 2004 年开始时的。

老王点评：居然选择了这么古老而不严谨的脚本，这十年间就难道没有一点点改进的想法吗？




VFX 参考平台建议动画行业升级到 RHEL 9

VFX 参考平台旨在帮助规范数字内容创作领域的软件平台，以发布年度软件建议清单而闻名，如每个操作系统上的编译器版本，特定年份的 Qt/Python/Numpy 组件，以及基于行业反馈和与各种内容创作者和工作室互动的各种其他软件版本。他们发布了一份报告，供视觉效果和动画工作室在选择下一个 Linux 平台时考虑。他们发现很多工作室仍然依赖 CentOS 7，他们建议这些工作室不迟于 2024 年转移到新的操作系统，首选是红帽的 RHEL 9，或者 Rocky Linux、AlmaLinux 等下游分支。他们也建议可以考虑 Ubuntu Linux。

老王点评：即便不想付费购买 RHEL 9，Rocky Linux 等也可以考虑。其实，根据我的研究， CentOS Stream 也是可以的。




Meta 用算法“随机”解雇 60 名劳务派遣人员

此前 Meta 与埃森哲签订了近 5 亿美元的合同，由隶属于后者的劳务派遣人员到 Meta 位于奥斯汀的办公室工作，主要开展内容审核和商业诚信等业务。Meta 通过视频电话会议告知被裁的员工，除了明确是“随机”选择之外，没有给出裁员的具体原因。去年 8 月份，游戏行业支付处理公司 Xsolla 也使用算法裁掉了 150 名员工。

                              <span>在 2020 年 SolarWinds 网络间谍活动之后，一系列进一步的软件供应链漏洞凸显了确保软件监管链安全的必要性。在这场间谍活动中，俄罗斯黑客渗透到一个广泛使用的 IT 管理平台，并将受污染的升级程序悄悄带入其中。由于开源项目从根本上来说是分散的，而且经常是临时的活动，因此在这种背景下，这个问题尤其紧迫。GitHub 著名的 npm 注册中心广泛使用的 JavaScript 软件包遭到一系列令人不安的黑客攻击后，该公司前不久公布了一项战略，以提供更好的开源安全保护。

代码签名平台 Sigstore 将由微软旗下的 GitHub 支持，以用于 npm 软件包。代码签名类似于数字蜡封。为了让开源维护者更加容易地确认他们编写的代码是否与全球范围内人们实际下载的软件包中最终包含的代码相同，跨行业协作促成了该工具的创建。

GitHub 并不是开源生态系统的唯一组成部分，但 Sigstore 的联合开发者、Chainguard 的首席执行官 Dan Lorenc 指出，它是社区的一个重要枢纽，因为绝大多数项目都在这里存储和共享源代码。然而，当开发人员真正想下载开源软件或工具时，他们通常会通过软件包管理进行。

通过让包管理器可以使用 Sigstore，开发人员可以在 Sigstore 工具的帮助下，在软件通过供应链时处理加密检查和要求。这增加了产品流通过程中每个阶段的透明度。Lorenc 说，许多人在得知这些完整性检查尚未实施时感到震惊，开源生态系统中相当大的一部分长期以来一直依赖于盲目的信心。拜登政府于 2021 年 5 月发布了一项行政命令，主要涉及软件供应链安全问题。

Linux 基金会、谷歌、红帽、Purdue Universit 和 Chainguard 都对 Sigstore 的开发做出了贡献。现在有了使用 Sigstore 为 Python 包发行版签名的官方软件，而且开发软件的开源环境 Kubernetes 现在也支持它。

Sigstore 依靠免费和简单易用来鼓励采用，就像主要行业推动 HTTPS 网络加密一样，这在很大程度上是由非营利组织互联网安全研究组Internet Security Research Group的 Let&#x27;s Encrypt 等工具实现的。据 GitHub 称，该项目会首先提出 Sigstore 将如何在 npm 中实现的建议，并在开放评论期征求社区人员对该工具的精确部署策略的意见。然而，最终的目标是让这样的代码签名能够被尽可能多的开源项目使用，从而让对供应链的攻击更加困难。

GitHub 的 Hutchings 说：“我们希望看到这样一个世界，最终所有的软件工件都被签名并链接回源代码，这就是为什么构建像 Sigstore 这样的开放技术栈是如此重要，其他打包存储库也可以采用这种技术。”

                              <span>deepin 23 将是一个有趣的升级，有几个基本的变化。




deepin 仍然是目前最 漂亮的 Linux 发行版 之一。

虽然整个用户体验可能不是毫无痛点的，但它还是看起来不错的。deepin 的开发者尝试了一些引人关注的定制，以使它从人群中脱颖而出。

如果你是第一次了解它，你应该知道它是 基于 Debian Linux 的有趣发行版 之一。

随着 deepin 20 和它最近的小版本发布，他们推出了一系列不错的升级。现在，看起来deepin 23 将是下一个主要的升级。

deepin 23 预览版中的新内容



deepin 23 预览版已经可以进行测试。与之前的版本不同，deepin 23 包括一些基本的升级，在多个层面上影响用户体验。

主要的亮点包括：


一个新的软件包格式。

一个新的系统更新的构想。

一个新的资源库。

新的墙纸。

Linux 内核 5.18。


新的软件包格式：玲珑



玲珑 是 deepin 开发的新软件包格式。

它的目的是解决 Linux 下传统软件包格式的复杂依赖性所造成的各种兼容性问题。此外，通过支持沙盒以及增量更新和隐私保护来减少安全风险。

截至目前，你可以在其 玲珑商店 上找到这些软件包。

我们需要另一种软件包格式吗？我不这么认为。

有了 Flatpak 和 Snap 的存在，它听起来并不像以前没有的新东西。

对我来说，看起来 deepin 只是想拥有自己的软件包格式作为其产品的一部分。

原子式更新

系统更新将被视为原子操作，也就是说，当软件包被成功安装后，更新就完成了。如果安装失败，系统可以恢复到以前的版本，没有任何变化。

因此，你在升级后可以得到系统回滚的支持，并可以避免部分升级的困难。

独立的上游

虽然它是基于 Debian 的，但 deepin 的目标是为核心软件包和一些可选组件建立一个独立的仓库。

对于预览版，开发者提到，他们打算从上游如 Debian 和 Arch Linux 中学习，以改进他们的仓库。

新的墙纸



像其他主要版本一样，deepin 23 增加了一些令人耳目一新的壁纸和新的默认壁纸。

下载 deepin 23 预览

请注意，deepin 23稳定版还没有上市。因此，如果你想在你的测试系统上进行实验，并体验一下，请尝试预览版。

你可以在 官方公告 中找到 ISO 文件的下载链接。

As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words, and while that&#x27;s not always the case with terminal commands and code, it still holds true for the graphical desktop. Screenshots capture precisely what&#x27;s on your screen. I love taking them to have a record of who attends meetings, so I don&#x27;t have to write it down at the moment. Or to capture a bug when doing UI testing. We all take them for different reasons, though, and there are more ways to take a screenshot than you might at first think.
I started thinking about screenshots after Jim Hall wrote an article listing GNOME screenshots, GIMP, and Firefox as the ways he often takes screenshots. And yet t…</span>

&quot;Hide &amp; Seek World&quot; continues to be my main project, but I got this idea to develop a simple quiz game for iOS too, so I made &quot;World Streaks&quot;. The goal was to create something super simple and fun that you can just play when you only have a couple minutes to kill. 

I hope you&#x27;ll enjoy it and let me know in the comments what you think.
And if you&#x27;ve played it, comment below what&#x27;s your best streak, let&#x27;s see who&#x27;s best! 😉

Cheers,
Istvan

💜💜💜💜💜

For now, I&#x27;m building ProjectionLab as a solo developer on nights and weekends. It&#x27;s already been quite a journey bringing PL to the point it is today; and I&#x27;m still energized and full of ideas for how to continue making it better, in part thanks to the feedback and support from communities of early adopters like you! 🙏 

Looking forward to hearing your feedback!

                              <span>本教程介绍了如何实时监控 Linux 日志文件（桌面、服务器或应用）以进行诊断和故障排除。


当你在 Linux 桌面、服务器或任何应用中遇到问题时，你首先会查看单独的日志文件。日志文件通常是文本流和来自应用的带有时间戳的消息。它可以帮助你缩小特定问题的范围，并使你能够找到问题的原因。它还可以帮助从网络获得帮助。

一般来说，所有的日志文件都位于 /var/log。此目录包含特定应用和服务的扩展名为 .log 的日志文件，它还包含了其他含有日志的独立目录。



所以，如果你想监控一堆日志文件或特定的一个，这里有一些方法可以做到。

Linux 实时监控日志文件

使用 tail 命令

tail 命令是实时跟踪日志文件的最基本方式。特别是如果你在只有终端而没有 GUI 的服务器中。这很有帮助。

基本语法如下：

tail /path/to/log/file


用法：



可以使用开关 -f 跟踪实时更新的日志文件。例如，如果要关注 syslog，可以使用以下命令。

tail -f /var/log/syslog


你可以使用单个命令监控多个日志文件：

tail -f /var/log/syslog /var/log/dmesg


如果要监视 HTTP 或 sftp 或任何服务器，可以在此命令中使用它们各自的日志文件。

请记住，上述命令需要管理员权限。

使用 lnav（日志文件浏览器）



lnav 是一个出色的程序，你可以用它来用彩色编码的信息以更有条理的方式监控日志文件。在 Linux 系统中，这个工具不是默认安装的。你可以用下面的命令来安装它：

Ubuntu：

sudo apt install lnav


Fedora：

sudo dnf install lnav


lnav 的好处在于，如果你不想安装它，你可以下载其预编译的可执行文件并在任何地方运行它，甚至可以从 U 盘上运行。无需设置，并加载了功能。使用 lnav，你可以通过 SQL 查询日志文件，以及其他很酷的功能，你可以在其官方网站上学习。

安装后，你可以在具有管理员权限的终端上运行 lnav，它会默认显示 /var/log 中的所有日志并开始实时监控。

关于 systemd 的 journalctl 的一个说明

当今所有现代 Linux 发行版都主要使用 systemd。 systemd 提供了运行 Linux 操作系统的基本框架和组件。 systemd 通过 journalctl 提供日志服务，这有助于管理来自所有 systemd 服务的日志。你还可以使用以下命令实时监控各个 systemd 服务和日志。

journalctl -f


以下是一些特定的 journalctl 命令，可用于多种情况。你可以将这些与上面的 -f 选项结合使用以开始实时监控。

对于紧急系统消息，请使用：

journalctl -p 0


显示带有解释的错误：

journalctl -xb -p 3


使用时间控制过滤：

journalctl --since &quot;2022-12-04 06:00:00&quot;
journalctl --since &quot;2022-12-03&quot; --until &quot;2022-12-05 03:00:00&quot;
journalctl --since yesterday
journalctl --since 09:00 --until &quot;1 hour ago&quot;


如果你想了解更多关于 journalctl 的详细信息，我已经在这写了份 指南。

结束语

我希望这些命令和技巧可以帮助你找到桌面或服务器中问题/错误的根本原因。有关更多详细信息，你可以随时参考手册页并使用各种选项。如果你对本文有任何意见或想法，请使用下面的评论栏告诉我。

干杯。

微软的一位工程师分享了一个 Windows XP 时代的故事：某些型号的笔记本电脑在播放珍妮·杰克逊的上世纪八十年代的热门音乐视频《节奏国度》时会崩溃。更离奇的是相邻的一台未播放音乐的笔记本电脑也崩溃了。原因是《节奏国度》中的音频与某款笔记本硬盘发生共振，会干扰其运行。该 bug 被赋予了正式的 CVE 编号 CVE-2022-38392。还好这些电脑是 2005 年上市的，基本上已经淘汰。

骗子利用带有微软徽标的 U 盘来诈骗

一位安全顾问称，接到了一个印刷有微软品牌的欺诈 U 盘。该 U 盘被包装在一个 Office 2021 专业版的纸盒内。当用户将该 U 盘插入他们的电脑之后，就会弹出一条假的警告信息，告知用户他们的系统中存在病毒，并提示受害者拨打技术支持电话，这显然是骗子使用的号码。然后，骗子要求受害者安装一个远程访问程序来接管系统。

老王点评：这诈骗真是用心了，还专门弄了包装盒和印刷了徽标的 U 盘。




DDoS 攻击新纪录：每秒请求超过 4600 万次

今年 6 月，Cloudflare 报告遭遇了有史以来最大规模的 DDoS 网络攻击，峰值每秒请求高达 2600 万次。这刷新了 2021 年 8 月创下的 1720 万次和 2022 年 4 月创下的 1530 万次。不过谷歌最近披露的一个数据创造了新纪录：峰值达到了每秒 4600 万次。攻击于 6 月 1 日凌晨开始，速度为每秒 1 万次请求，但在 8 分钟后升至每秒 10 万次请求，此时 Cloud Armor 自适应保护启动。两分钟后，每秒请求数增加到 4600 万。攻击在 69 分钟内消失了，可能是因为被 Cloud Armor 挫败而没有达到预期的效果。

前言
对于Flutter开发者来说，build_runner 可以说并不是一个陌生的东西，很多package中就要求调用build_runner 来自动生成处理代码，比如说json_serializable;
但正如其描述中所述的那样，其是通过 Dart Build System来实现的，build_runner 和其又是一个什么关系，接下来就来学习一下dart的build系统
dart 的 build 系统
组成
dart 的 build系统，由 build_config、 build_modules、build_resolvers、 build_runner、 build_test、 build_web_compilers 共同组合、完成了dart 的 build 系统；
build_config 就是解析那个build.yaml文件，用来配置build_runner，没什么好说的，具体的功能后面再细说；
build_modules 好像是解析module级别信息的一个库
build_resolvers 从自述文件中分析，好像是一个给build_runner 每步提供所需信息的解析器？
build_runner 整个build系统的核心部分，其他部分都是为了拓展和实现此功能而存在的；
build_test 字面意思，一个测试库；
build_web_compilers 用于web端的build系统；
作用
Flutter的build系统其实就是生成代码，对标的应该是JAVA的APT这块的东西；
另外，对于 dart 的 build 系统，官方是有这么一段介绍：

Recently, I published my first book, The Kubernetes Operator Framework Book from Packt Publishing. Writing a book has always been a personal goal of mine, and so it seems fitting that I was able to check that off by writing about one of my favorite topics: Kubernetes.
My journey with Kubernetes began in 2016, as a software engineer for Red Hat OpenShift. There, I had the opportunity to work with (and learn from) some of the smartest folks in the open source community. I learned first-hand some of the best practices for Kubernetes development as they were applied to broad enterprise use cases. And as I watched the development of OpenShift 4 take shape, I got to witness the functionalit…</span>

Notes are part of any writer&#x27;s life. Most of my articles begin in a note-taking application and that’s usually Joplin for me. There are a large number of note-taking apps for Linux and you may use something other than my favorite. A recent blog article reminded me of a half dozen of them, so I assembled a list of my favorites.

Joplin is available on Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. I like Joplin because it automatically saves whatever you add to it. Notes can be uploaded to NextCloud, OwnCloud, Joplin Cloud, and even closed source services like OneDrive, Dropbox, or any WebDav applications. Joplin supports en…</span>

本次推送延续此前的逻辑，在有了场地、设备等硬件设施后，分享一档节目如何诞生。也可以说是内容创作的SOP（标准流程），邀请声东击西、日谈公园、津津乐道、深夜谈谈、番薯剥壳工作室，讲述专业播客机构的内容生产流程，如何保证节目质量始终保持一定水准？如何协调不同工种间的工作？一期节目上线前要经历什么？
每期精品内容的产出都是在推动播客朝着行业化的方向发展，感谢各大机构工作人员的热情参与！

审核和内容收集
(虽然是具体情况具体分析，但是对于部分节目可以固定下来)
 
1、资料完善度
主持人需要详细的提纲，这对后面流程完善起到重要作用
主持人需要提交的是:嘉宾资料(姓名正确书写、头衔、照片、希望给到的社交媒体账号)+**建议标题**+采访内容&amp;提纲+音频收集+建议删除内容
 
2、素材给到时间(1.5 小时，2 人对话)
负责人:主播+监制
素材一般提前7天，至少不晚于3/4日给到
 
3 播客完成版提交审核的时间
负责人:后期
后期的制作的重点永远是:时间节点，如果只给到2天时间制作，请用好这两天时间，没必要永远优化细化无止境的美化下去。
理想的完成版审核日期，是上线前1日以上，如果无法在1日之前提交，请提前在群中说明原因
 
此外:剪辑之前请提前和节目负责人(主播/监制)确认:是否需要给嘉宾审核，考虑到嘉宾时差(如北美时间)、工作繁忙(大公司CEO)，可能需要跨自然日审核，所以最好上线前至少两天给到嘉宾粗剪版用来审核.
 
比如周二上线商业Y酱，周一需要提交音频审核，如果周一无法提交审核，需要周五说明情况

                              <span>由于上学和工作的关系，最近十多年我一直住在机场附近。机场内会有比其他地方更加专业的气象观测设备，而且能做到实时更新。借助这个优势我养成了看气象报文、雷达拼图和Prog Charts来判断天气的习惯。当然了，我做着一份靠天吃饭的工作，肯定是比别人更关心天气。那今天跟大家聊一聊我在平时是怎么看天气的~
一般情况
系统自带的天气app永远是最方便易用的，开机即用功能简单。在把天气信息截图分享，一目了然。我就偶尔问Siri或者Google Assistant明天天气怎么样，享受一下有助手的高级感。
看本场天气
我一般住在机场附近，所以看机场的气象报文基本等于在看自己家的天气。METAR1报看实时天气，TAF2报看未来24小时。可以看到刮什么样的风，下什么样的雨，能见度适不适合出门拍照，几点到几点不能上天台晒被子，有+TSRA了去远程哄一哄被打雷吓到的妹子，等等这些。

在 Android 平台上使用的是 Avia Weather ，简洁而且免费，只看天气很够用。付费之后可以解锁Groups功能，可以把一些机场分类。
 
在iOS上用的是AeroWeather Pro，最主要的是它有好用的Widget，还可以添加到Shortcuts。订阅后可以解锁所有飞行中能见到的气象图表。
 
报文里乱七八糟的字母和数字看不懂没关系，有兴趣的童鞋推荐给你们两份指南，一份是FAA的，一份是USAF的 。
看未来天气
    
MyRadar和Windy的功能类似，可以选择查看的信息极其丰富，好多航校甚至是航空公司也会用他们的数据。想要看懂这些图？不如来这里学习一下：aviationweather.gov/help 。下面是看图经验：

被高气压控制，通常都是好天气，反之亦然
有黄色或者西红柿炒鸡蛋颜色的地方一定有雷雨
预判雷雨的移动方向和速度
准静止锋类似暖锋，有持续不断的阴雨连绵
孤立的雷暴单体，下雨也就是一阵儿
冬天爬山，可以在零度等温线附近打卡留念
等压线密集的地方，有大风！
预测你的航班会不会因为天气原因延误
朋友坐飞机，告诉ta在起飞后的多久会遇到明显颠簸
看到哪里有火山喷发，搜一下那里附近的人上传的视频

除此之外，还能在Flightradar24上查看到气象信息，搭配飞机的飞行轨迹，看雷雨绕飞更加直观。不过实时的飞行轨迹和滞后的气象雷达图之间会有错位，有时候感觉莫名其妙。雷雨天气去机场接朋友，可以精准地选择出发时间，能在家多待会儿就多待会儿。
  
 
如果订阅了ForeFlight，再去坐飞机，会让飞行体验有质的飞跃~
 
我想大多数人都不会为了简单看个天气去搞这么复杂，不仅要记住奇奇怪怪的符号还要在app之间换来换去。只是因为我的工作离不开这些，顺便就带到了生活中，用起来还很顺手，就一直这样了。
我印象中分钟级降水预报是前几年彩云天气最早做出来的，我也有一个同样分钟级预报的故事：有一天我恰好在AOC大厅的气象雷达屏幕前，我想能不能人肉播报一次天气预报啊，于是就给我远在老家的老妈打了电话。问她家里是不是阴天啦，有没有下雨啊，她说阴天了没下雨。我说过一会儿就下啦。电话里聊了大概十分钟之后，诶，雨就来了。
哦对了，如果你女朋友说，晚上吃完饭我们去海边散散步吹吹海风吧。你一定要纠正她，晚上在海边儿吹的是陆风，不是海风，要不然叫海陆风也行。总之，天气这件事儿一定要弄清楚。</span>

 作为一个抖音受害者，我时常反思，有没有办法像刷抖音一样地学习？
 于是我拿出了 RSS 这个远古信息管理神器。 
上一篇文章，我们解决了「RSS 订阅源」的问题，本期内容我们就来解决 RSS 的第二大难题：RSS 阅读器。
一、RSS 阅读器
RSS 阅读器的选择，可以说五花八门。 
但总体上可以分为两种：一种是本地阅读器，一种是在线阅读器。
1、本地 RSS 阅读器
浏览器早期自带就有 RSS 阅读功能。 
但自从 2018 年 Firefox 也宣布取消 RSS 功能后，RSS 就彻底与浏览器分家。 
如今想要用 RSS，那么就要用浏览器扩展，又或者是客户端软件，现在常用的本地 RSS 阅读器有： 

本地 RSS 阅读器的特点，是操作感强，自定义功能多。 
但同时，本地 RSS 阅读器需要用自身网络来抓取更新，所以如果你不开启的话，那么就不会有新内容。
2、在线 RSS 阅读器
而在线 RSS 阅读器的特点，则是支持自动更新，还有跨平台同步。 
而且，一般还会有全文搜索、内容过滤、第三方服务集成等高级功能，现在常用的在线 RSS 阅读器有： 

但在线 RSS 阅读器的缺点也很明显。
 首先，免费帐户往往都会有订阅源数量、刷新时间的限制，并且还会有广告。 
所以综合而言，RSS 阅读器更好的选择是：使用本地 RSS 客户端来浏览在线 RSS 帐户。
3、Windows / 安卓方案
在 Windows 平台，我的选择是 Fluent Reader + Inoreader 内地版。 
Fluent Reader 是一款开源免费的 RSS 阅读器，界面简洁好看，而且是目前唯一全平台支持的 RSS 阅读器。 

Inoreader 的内地版（地址里比原来多一个 n），
是目前大陆地区，为数不多还能用的在线 RSS 阅读器。 …</span>

                              <span>写在前面
2020 年 7 月 29 日，我来到了北京，开始了自己的北漂生活。工作之后发现时间过得很快，转眼已经北漂两年了。在北京短短的两年里，留下了很多珍贵的回忆。北漂一年整的时候就有写篇回忆录的想法，但迟迟没有动笔，如今已经开启了北漂的第三年，感觉是时候开始提笔写这篇回忆录了。
前段时间在中国好邻居家里吃了顿饭，听阮哥说起「到底什么是北漂」。我觉得每个人对「北漂」的定义都是不一样的。我理解的「北漂」，暂时先卖个关子。
在北京
当初自己本科毕业的时候首选的是在北京、上海、深圳三座城市找工作。大学因为没在一线城市读，时常懊悔和一线城市比，资源还是匮乏，所以工作说什么也要去一线城市感受一下。后来因为上海离家太近首先就排除了上海，加上一直没去过北方，就直接考虑了去北京工作。
当初考虑北京的因素其实有两个，一是北京的互联网氛围我了解到的是比上海、深圳要好的，比如很多互联网公司当时都是在北京成立的，二是我很喜欢音乐，作为全国摇滚的发源地，氛围这方面北京是当之无愧的全国第一。
其实在北京最大的一个感受就是舒服。曾经听网上有人用一个字来形容北京，那就是「土」。在北京生活了两年，倒也确实慢慢理解了北京的「土」。比如胡同的起名，比如北京人的打扮没有那么精致，比如 CBD 旁边可能就是普通居民楼。
胡同
很喜欢北京的一点就是有逛不完的胡同。虽然随着城市规划，胡同已经少了很多，但我两年里仍然没有把每一条胡同都走一遍。而且北京的胡同绕到完全能让人迷路，从这条胡同穿到那条胡同的感觉太奇妙了。
前段时间参加了朋友拍的《胡同日记·春》纪录片线下放映活动，衔接去年冬天拍的《胡同日记·冬》。在她的镜头下，我感受到了北京胡同里发生的美好。如果有机会，还是挺想搬去胡同住一段时间的。
最喜欢的就是鼓楼那一片的胡同，咖啡店和小清吧很多。不管是白天在胡同里找家咖啡店坐下来喝一杯，还是晚上和朋友吃完饭，穿梭在胡同里，…</span>

众所周知，Square 出品的内存泄漏检测工具 LeakCanary 可以很方便的检测出 App 中存在的内存泄漏问题。当我们决定要不要在项目中引入 LeakCanary 的时候，经常也会听到声音：
“LeakCanary 接入简单，无需手动初始化。”
“LeakCanary 虽好，但就是太卡。”
“LeakCanary 虽好，但无法线上使用。”
一度我也是这么认为的，直到我认真研究了下才发现，事实可能并没有那么简单。本文就是尝试从 LeakCanary 的一些高级用法，来重新论证上述的观点。 文末会附上完整代码，可直接使用。
想要使用 LeakCanary 的一些高级用法，首先就是需要我们主动掌握 LeakCanary 的初始化时机，添加一些自定义的配置，下面就看一下如何手动初始化 LeakCanary ？
如何手动初始化 LeakCanary ？
正常情况下，我们只要添加下面一行代码，就可以在 App 中使用 LeakCanary 了。
dependencies {
  // debugImplementation because LeakCanary should only run in debug builds.
  debugImplementation &#x27;com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:2.9.1&#x27;
}

自动初始化
这是怎么做到的？是采用了 ContentProvider 的加载机制来做的。简单讲大致流程如下：

先执行 Application中的attachBaseContext 函数；
然后会执行 ContentProvider 中的 onCreate 函数；
最后才会走到 Application 中的 onCreate 函数中；

                              <span>一、背景
现在的移动应用，视频是一个非常重要的组成部分，好像里面不搞一点视频就不是一个正常的移动App。在视频开发方面，可以分为视频录制和视频播放，视频录制的场景可能还比较少，这方面可以使用Google开源的 grafika。相比于视频录制，视频播放可以选择的方案就要多许多，比如Google的 ExoPlayer，B站的 ijkplayer，以及官方的MediaPlayer。
不过，我们今天要讲的是视频的缓存。最近，由于我们在开发视频方面没有考虑视频的缓存问题，造成了流量的浪费，然后遭到用户的投诉。在视频播放中，一般有两种两种策略：先下载再播放和边播放边缓存。
通常，为了提高用户的体验，我们会选择边播放边缓存的策略，不过市面上大多数的播放器都是只支持视频播放，在视频缓存这块基本上没啥好的方案，比如我们的App使用的是一个自己封装的库，类似于PlayerBase。PlayerBase是一种将解码器和播放视图组件化处理的解决方案框架，也即是一个对ExoPlayer、ijkplayer的包装库。
二、PlayerBase
PlayerBase是一种将解码器和播放视图组件化处理的解决方案框架。您需要什么解码器实现框架定义的抽象引入即可，对于视图，无论是播放器内的控制视图还是业务视图，均可以做到组件化处理。并且，它支持视频跨页面无缝衔接的效果，也是我们选择它的一个原因。
PlayerBase的使用也比较简单，使用的时候需要单独的添加解码器，具体使用哪种解码器，可以根据项目的需要自由的进行配置。
只使用MediaPlayer：
dependencies {
  //该依赖仅包含MediaPlayer解码
  implementation &#x27;com.kk.taurus.playerbase:playerbase:3.4.2&#x27;
}

使用ExoPlayer + MediaPlayer

0x1、引言
解完BUG，又有时间摸鱼学点东西了，最近在复习Kotlin，跟着朱涛的 《Kotlin 编程第一课》查缺补漏。

看到泛型这一章时，想起之前面一家小公司时的面试题：
说下你对泛型协变和逆变的理解？
读者可以试试在不查资料的情况下能否答得上来？
反正我当时是没想起来，尽管写过一篇《Kotlin刨根问底(三)：你真的懂泛型，会用吗？》，我以为自己对泛型了然于胸。
究其根源，对概念名词的理解浮于表面，模棱两可，知道有这个东西，但本质是什么？为啥要用？怎么用？并没有二次加工形成自己的思考和理解，所以印象不深刻。加之 泛型平时开发用的不多，记和忆 两个要素都没做到，久了自然会忘。

而网上关于泛型讲解的文章大都千篇一律：集合 存取元素类型异常引出泛型，不变、协变、逆变、型变一把梭，什么能读不能写，能写不能读，读者看完好像懂了，又好像没懂，这很正常，毕竟作者自己都可能弄不明白，2333。就问你一句：泛型只能用在集合上吗？

综上原因，有了这篇文章，本节换个角度，从根上理解泛型，少说废话掐要点，这次一定拿下Java/Kotlin泛型。
0x2、泛型到底是什么？
直接说结论：
泛型的本质 → 类型参数化 → 要操作的数据类型 可以通过 参数的形式来指定。
说人话：把数据类型变成参数。
难理解？类比 函数/方法，定义时指定 参数类型(形参)，调用时传入 具体参数实例(实参)：

泛型 也是如此，定义时指定 数据类型(形参)，调用时传入 具体数据类型(实参)：

非常相似，只是 数据类型 的定义和传递都是通过 ，而不是()，那 泛型的作用是什么呢？直接说结论：

前言
上一篇提到：Android—以面试角度剖析HashMap源码，分析了HashMap源码。为了加深印象，因此这篇将会实现手写HashMap！
话不多说，直接开始！（结合上一篇一起看效果更佳哟）
1、初始化
从上一篇我们知道：HashMap初始化分为：无参构造器；有两个参数的构造器。因此我们照虎画猫也来搞两个构造器！
1.1 无参初始化
从上一篇我们得知：
初始化无参构造器，对应map长度默认为：1 implements Map {
    //     扩冲
    float loadFactor &#x3D; 0.75f;
    //16  1 implements Map {
    //     扩冲

前沿
关于对角棋相信大家都不陌生，其凭借着规则简单又灵活多变成为我们童年不可缺少的益智游戏。
今天我将用Flutter来实现一个对角棋游戏，即巩固自己Flutter的绘制和手势知识，也希望这篇文章对大家有所帮助。
演示效果
老规矩，我们先演示下实现的最终效果：

对角棋规则
首先我们还是回顾下对角棋游戏的规则，这里借用 百度百科 的规则说明：
棋盘：象棋棋盘中，将士所在的带对角线的田字框。
棋子：双方各持三子，颜色不同。
初始：如图1所示，各自对立。
胜利条件：其中一方三子，占据一条对角线，或者对方没有棋子可以移动。
玩法：沿着棋盘划线，双方交互移动棋子，一次一只能移动一步，不包括交叉。


实现思路
棋盘。绘制棋盘
棋子。绘制棋子
手势。处理点击棋子及移动位置手势
规则。规则分为棋子移动规则、游戏胜利规则两部分

具体实现
1. 绘制棋盘
说到绘制，我们需要先创建 CustomPaint 通过自定义 CustomPainter 来实现。
CustomPaint(
    size: Size(width, height),
    painter: DiagonalChessPainter(),
)

考虑到我们要适配不同的手机尺寸，因此我们先通过 LayoutBuilder 测量整个 Widget 的尺寸，并计算棋盘在屏幕上位置。
LayoutBuilder(
        builder: (BuildContext context, BoxConstraints constraints) {
          initPosition(constraints);
          return GestureDetector(…</span>

At this year&#x27;s DrupalCon North America, EPAM Solution Architect John Picozzi presented a talk about the importance of non-code contribution. He talked about how everyone can get involved and why he believes this is an important topic. This article is a text adaptation of John&#x27;s talk; find a link below to a video recording of the complete presentation at DrupalCon.
What is non-code contribution? I asked Google this question and got the following answer: &quot;Any contribution that helps an open source project that does not involve writing code.&quot; Thanks, Google, but I already figured that out. If you asked me to dig deeper, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about providing your time, skills…</span>

写在前面
现在的我已经不再是一个学生，甚至也不再做研究。不过，写毕业论文的时候采用的工具和方法，确实一直沿用至今，已经为工作而进行了些许改良。在读硕士研究生的三年生活中（其实第三年已经在工作岗位上度过），我曾经尝试过不少与研究或者论文写作相关的数字工具；这些工具中有些帮助我在阅读文献的过程中准确把握文章意思，从而确定了个人选题；有些则在实验进展过程中帮助我看清数据之间的关系；还有些则是论文写作的时候帮了我大忙… 不过，这三年的研究生历程也让我越来越意识到，工具与效率之间并非强烈相关：或许有的时候工具的使用反而让人南辕北辙，采用更加精简的工具，以及加入更多个人的思考，才是完成研究工作的重点。
这篇文章仅仅是想要介绍自己在论文写作的过程中用到的一些工具与方法。我研究的科目是汉语作为第二语言习得。研究生期间除了研究本身，还需要承担一些教学工作，以及一些学生管理的工作，这篇文章也会有所涉猎。
Notion：是知识库，也是数据库，还是静态网页
Notion 的多面性与灵活性，我想少数派上的众多文章已经解释得清楚明白。但至于具体如何使用，这就看个人的情况了。在我个人的例子中，主要使用了 Notion 以下几个方面的特性：

数据库功能 - 用于学生信息管理、进度追踪、组会笔记
反向链接功能 - 用于阅读文献和笔记重点内容
静态网页分享功能 - 用于呈现课程大纲、更新课程材料

Notion 的数据库功能，由于数据库中每一条都可以单独作为一个页面，每一个页面上又可以创建新的数据库…… 如此嵌套之后，形成了十分灵活的数据库体系。无论是用于学生信息的管理、进度追踪还是系列笔记，都可以在短时间内搭建起较为整洁美观的数据表格。
Notion X 学生管理
研究生期间一大工作是助教工作，需要管理一个二三十人的留学生班级。在学期初，我从教务老师那里拿到学生名单之…</span>

                              <span>痛点
之前我跟你聊过很多次用卡片笔记法写文章的事儿。今天咱们换个话题，聊聊用卡片法做视频。
现在是移动互联网时代，学习和工作中需要用到视频制作的地方，还真不少。尤其是像我这样当老师的。

我这几年做了许多视频。但是实话实说，凡是复杂一些的视频，特别是技术类讲解展示，我在制作的时候总会感觉很焦虑。
焦虑的原因，是表达欲和成熟度不匹配。
我最想表达的时刻，往往是刚让电脑跑出来一个结果。这时候，我特别想把自己的成果和喜悦心情分享出去。
但是，一般这时候内容成熟度是不够的。例如前面的铺垫内容，还都没有准备好。讲解的思路，也都没有理顺。
怎么办呢？
常见做法，自然就是去查找和准备这些资料，直到胸有成竹。这样自己讲解内容时，才不会露怯。
可等到内容成熟度足够了，时间往往已经过去许久，我也没有那么想展示自己做出来的结果了，因为兴奋感衰退了。
很多有趣的内容，因此淹没在了我的笔记里。更可惜的，是那些没有记录下来的内容，就丢弃在风中了。可惜。
最近，我开始尝试用 Stable Diffusion 来人工智能绘图。这款工具真是非常强大。绘制出来的内容，比起 Disco Diffusion ，要精细得多。说明一下，我不是画家，上面描述的，是本人尝试对比后的主观感受。请不要跟我讨论某些风格上「Disco Diffusion 甩开 Stable Diffusion 几条街」之类的。不听不听。
举个例子，我最近开始读《九宫格写作法》这本书。里面有一段描述顾客尝试过一碗汤后的评论：

汤底是炖了 3 天的猪骨浓汤，配菜是汆烫得恰到好处的豆芽菜，吃起来脆嫩爽口。桌子上放有店家推荐的柚子胡椒，只需撒上一点点，柚子那清新的酸味便会让你眼前一亮。

我于是好奇心大起，就想尝试一下，这碗汤画出来是什么样子。于是我决定用 Stable Diffusion 来画。
首先还得把上面那段话翻译成英文，因为 Stable …</span>

这个APP是弄毕业设计的时候写的，也是一个比较成规模的个人项目，断断续续花了几个月的时间，将会分为多篇文章记录一下。刚开始写这个APP的时候也仅仅看完郭霖老师的一本《第一行代码》。由于在学习的过程中用到了很多别人的成果，纠结了很久发不发出来，现在发出来用来记录我的Android学习路程。后续将会用多篇文章爬坑。。。
先上项目链接
https://github.com/MReP1/LittleGooseOffice
项目中的代码有部分来源于开源代码，由于写的时间离现在有点远，有些记不清，如有冒犯到，请联系本人。
日历模块来自于：https://github.com/huanghaibin-dev/CalendarView 3.7.1开源版本，由于用的时候JCenter跑路了，因此就拷了一份放本地。
时间选择模块来自于呆呆维尼大佬的：https://juejin.cn/post/6844903685441454087 很好用，推荐！
富文本模块忘了。
APP封面也忘了，如有抄袭到原作者的设计，请联系我。
设计

在进行APP UI设计的时候参考了Material Design的设计和使用了Error配色。[设计稿链接]
(https://www.figma.com/file/V7rofx7MnlAsZUVcmmOZ1i/Account?node-id&#x3D;712%3A1773)

由于当代Android手机太大了，因此我主要将操作区域放在了屏幕的中下方，将展示区域放在屏幕的上方，方便使用。
APP中的主要功能为笔记、记账、记录事务、纪念日的功能，有很多市面上应用的影子，也比较缝合。
MVVM
本APP架构使用了MVVM架构。
Model 层
在数据持久上使用了Room数据库，使用DataStore存放一些不是很重要的数据，没有架设服务器。在使用Room的时候遇到了比较多的坑，并且网上常见的教程都是关于简单使用，场景一旦复杂就没什么教程了，之后有时间会写一期说说。

ViewModel 层
ViewModel使用了Jetpack同名框架ViewModel，这里就没什么好说的，主要承接View和Model层之间的中间人。

View 层
View层主要应用到了观察者模式，也是第一次接触这个模式。

部分界面展示
主页

账单分析界面
设计比较多的数据处理，使用MPAndroidChart开源库生成图表。

纪念日界面
主要功能仿造Day Matter倒数日

多选删除
说实话这个功能看着简单，做起来不简单。。。在实现的时候用了很多笨方法，性能其实不是很好，胜在测试数量不大（几千条）的时候也不会造成不流畅的现象，在以后掌握了新知识的时候会对这一块进行重构。

总结
暂时先到这啦，先占个坑。以后慢慢对项目中的比较重要的地方爬坑。</span>

对于应用开发工程师来说，虽然我们不需要写操作系统代码，但是了解View最终是如何显示到屏幕上还是非常有必要的
本篇是Android图形系列的第三篇文章，在之前的两篇文章中分别介绍了屏幕的“显示原理”和屏幕的“刷新原理”，今天我们来一起学习Android系统的图形架构设计，聊一聊输送到屏幕的画面数据是如何产生的
本文的目标是希望读者朋友建立一个Android图形子系统的框架，因此，文中不会包含太多的方法调用链以及代码逻辑，非Android开发工程师也可以放心食用
前排提醒：全文近2万字，建议阅读时长30分钟

一、开篇
“当我们点开‘微信’这个应用后，它是怎么在屏幕上显示出来的？”
这是一个非常复杂的问题，它的背后包含了由厂商驱动、Linux操作系统、HAL硬件抽象层和Android Framework框架层共同组建的一套非常庞大的Android图形子系统
想要给出这个问题的答案，就必须对Android图形子系统背后的运行流程有所了解
今天，我们从认识Android设备中的硬件开始，自下而上
一起来看看庞大的Android图形子系统是如何组建起来的
1、硬件驱动
雷总曾经说过，再复杂的系统设计，也离不开硬件的支持
在文章的开头，我们就先来了解一下：支撑应用程序绘图的硬件有哪些？

                              <span>一、Android 13 正式版发布
今天，没做任何预告，谷歌为Pixel用户（Pixel 4、4a、5、5a和6系列等）送出惊喜，Android 13首个稳定版正式推送。
随后，谷歌承诺包括三星、小米、iQOO、摩托、一加、OPPO、Realme、vivo、传音、华硕、夏普、诺基亚、索尼等在内的第三方厂商，也会在今年晚些时候带来升级更新。对Android比较关注的同学可能知道，Android 13带来了安全改进、UI/主题完善、生产力提升、OpenJDK 11 LTS更新、ART优化、垃圾收集改进以及其他各种进化和变化。

需要注意的是，Google Pixel 6/Pixel6 Pro和Pixel 6a由于其搭载自研Tensor处理器，正式版Android 13会连同Bootloader一块更新，带来的结果就是，后续不能降级回Android 12。不过，正参与Android Beta项目也就是使用Android 13测试版的Pixel 6不影响，主要退出Beta，就能回归Android 12。

根据之前官方的介绍，最新的的Android 13主要升级点包括隐私安全和大幅优化大屏、折叠屏、小内存手机的流畅度。
二、新特性汇总
Android 13 面向开发者引入了一些出色的新功能和 API，参考官方Android 13 功能和变更列表，下表列出了所有可能会影响应用开发者的功能和行为变更的记录。

手把手教你快速搞定4个职场写作场景
一、写作无处不在
Hello，我是小木箱，今天主要分享的内容是职场写作。接下来几天，我会给你们分享一些适用于不同场景的写作case，帮你搞定职场写作能力。
说到写作，很多朋友觉得是一件高大上、高门槛的事情。首先在工作中，写一封邮件 — 算写作。精准概括总结Boss的会议内容 — 算写作；其次在生活中，朋友圈发的推广文案— 算写作；最后每逢年底，你写的那份年终总结 — 也算是写作。
所以写作是工作中和生活中应用非常广泛、影响力非常大的一项技能。本文希望通过建立一套全新认知，让你从本质上意识到写作的重要性，下定决心学好写作。
不管你未来是否会从事写作相关的工作，不管你是否准备靠写作赚钱，强烈建议你学会写作。因为写作能够给你带来的帮助，远比你想象的要多。

二、学会写作的原因
2018年 6 月份，我开始尝试学习写作，没写作之前，我甚至无法完整构建一套属于自己的技术体系，后面思考了一下，为什么不通过写作来提升自己影响力同时建立知识框架呢?
我用了一年的时间，总共写了大约六十篇技术博客，文章渐渐得到掘金运营认可。之后，个人博客被某些大号转载。
我从长沙到深圳这两年，跳槽两次，工资涨了三倍。更有甚者，某些小公司面试全是走一下流程，然后就要我了。
所以我特别清楚，学好写作带来的优势。接下来我从四个方面来展开说说写作究竟能够带来哪些好处。
2.1 写作可以作为衡量你个人能力的指标
第一，写作可以作为衡量你价值的重要指标，对于技术人员而言写作能力不仅是你过往持续学习和未来文档能力的最直接体现，而且你的文章会毫无保留地体现你的发展潜力、创新意识、思维方式、知识深度和知识广度。所以写作能力强会极大地提高目标公司对你的印象分。

混入类引言
混入类是 Dart 中独有的概念，它是 继承 、实现 之外的另一种 is-a 关系的维护方式。它和接口非常像，一个类支持混入多个类，但在本质上和接口还是有很大区别的。在感觉上来说，从耦合性来看，混入类像是 抽象类 和 接口 的中间地带。下面就来认识一下混入类的 使用与特性 。
1. 混入类的定义与使用
混入类通过 mixin 关键字进行声明，如下的 MoveAble 类，其中可以持有 成员变量 ，也可以声明和实现成员方法。对混入类通过 with 关键字进行使用，如下的 Shape 混入了 MoveAble 类。在下面 main 方法测试中可以看出，混入一个类，就可以访问其中的成员属性与方法，这点和 继承 非常像。
void main(){
  Shape shape &#x3D; Shape();
  shape.speed &#x3D; 20; 
  shape.move();//&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;Shape move&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;
  print(shape is MoveAble);// true
}
​
mixin MoveAble{
  double speed &#x3D; 10;
  void move(){
    print(&quot;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;$runtimeType move&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&quot;);
  }
}
​
class Shape with MoveAble{
​
}

一个类可以混入若干个类，通过 , 号隔开。如下 Shape 混入了 MoveAble 和 PaintAble ，就表示 Shape 对象可以同时拥有这两个类的能力。这个功能和接口有点相似，不过混入类可以进行对方法进行实现，这点要比接口更灵活。有点 随插随用 的感觉，甚至 Shape 类中可以什么都不…</span>

When it comes to time synchronization for embedded systems in a distributed architecture, there are &quot;soft&quot; use cases (typical, everyday devices) and complex, or &quot;hard,&quot; use cases (car brake systems, aerospace). It&#x27;s easy to see that a hard use case has unique requirements and a low tolerance for latency. To put it another way, hard use cases have hard, real-time constraints.
Latency is the bitter enemy of real-time computation. Latency, in the context of a critical real-time application, is the time between data generation and data reception. The reality is that when there is an interconnected network of several systems, there&#x27;s latency.

While working on the open source ZenTao project, I get constant feedback that getting Agile up and running is a big task in many organizations. As with any new process, you will run into issues, and many of them will feel unique to your organization. While context is important, there&#x27;s a certain amount of abstraction possible after you&#x27;ve coached enough teams. This article covers the four most common issues I&#x27;ve encountered. While your Agile coach should analyze any actual problems in the context of your organization, knowing these general issues can help better prepare you and your teams for the transitional process.

𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗮 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁:
I often create different projects in the form of websites and often those sites will be static or client-side rendered. 

Having a contact form on static sites through third-party services involves a bit of extra work and sometimes could be cumbersome. I often ignore adding contact or feedback forms on most of my sites to avoid the hassle of setting forms.

So I thought if there&#x27;s a free tool that lets me embed contact forms on any number of sites without writing code and just in a few steps, it would be great!

That&#x27;s where this 𝑓𝗈𝗋𝗆𝗂𝖿𝗒 idea came to me.

𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘂𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀:
1. Ability to add different emails for different forms to receive notification
2. Enhance the form script and add multiple color themes for users to select.
3. Email notification toggler for each form

Hope this formify application will be helpful to all those who want to add contact forms to their sites without much hassle. 💫

Please share your views/feedback about this product.

Thank you for stopping by 🙏

早在今年 2 月，CalDigit 就正式在全球发布了新一代雷电 4 的扩展坞 TS4。作为 TS3 Plus 的升级版本，更多的接口和更高的规格，着实让我有了不少期待。和 CalDigit 的朋友联系之后，我也在 3 月中旬收到了这款真正让我「梦寐以求」的雷电 4 扩展坞。
但关于它和它背后的故事，还要从 2019 年说起。
缘起于 2019 年的一个期待
在 2019 年的年度征文中，我曾经描述过一个符合我需求的理想型扩展坞是怎样的。然而，由于 macOS 系统和雷电 3 的一些限制，我始终没有找到这样一款设备。在前前后后摸索的过程中，总计花掉了近一台 iPhone 11 的钱。
首先，由于 macOS 并不支持通过 DisplayPort 来实现 Display Chain，想要以扩展形式连接显示器就必须占用掉下行的雷电接口，否则就只能镜像显示。其次，雷电 3 在带宽的分配中，硬性规定了必须保留 18Gbps 的带宽用于显示信号（DisplayPort）的传输，实际留给数据传输的空间只有 22Gbps。而且，显示带宽在不足时，还可以占用这为数不多的 22Gbps 数据带宽，反之，就算没有外接显示器，数据带宽也不能使用为显示预留的 18Gpbs。
当时妥协但最好的选择：CalDigit TS3 Plus
直到雷电 4 的到来，这个情况才得以获得改变。
首先，Intel 在雷电 4 协议上取消了为 DisplayPort 预留 18 Gpbs 带宽，提供了满速的 32Gbps 数据传输（相当于 PCIe 3.0×4），尽管还…</span>

                              <span>作为少数派的老用户和资深潜水员，在各种文章中探索到了新的工具和学到了很多使用小技巧。在过去从学生到金融狗的过程中，笔记管理也逐步完成了从Evernote-&gt;印象笔记(别用!)-&gt;Notion的切换。在少数派上有很多科研大神、学生/老师、Blogger以及其他行业的用户来分享他们在Notion上的用法和经验，但鲜少见到金融行业的分享案例——可能大家都忙着写点评和忙着送外卖了(误)。我就来抛砖引玉分享一点作为一个苦逼消费研究员用Notion来管理行业研究的经验。
背景提醒：用的是自己电脑(Macbook Pro，Mac版本的万得是永远的痛)，没有太多分享的需求，以及作为买方纪要查的不严，有合规风险的请自行判断哈。以下中英文混杂请见谅。
整体架构和思路
起因：其实很久以前在Notion刚出的时候有尝试过以块结构为基础的笔记软件，但当时觉得只是有些新意以及排版会好看一点，但对于自身的Evernote用户来说并没有太大的吸引力。直到回国后，发现Notion已经有了非常能用的Database功能，加上被国内印象笔记折磨了千百次，才动了尝试迁移到Notion的想法。
需求：在入职成为一个消费研究员之后逐步理清了自己在文档管理方面的需求，发现和Notion能提供的其实非常贴合。作为一个金融行业的研究员，每天会主动被动的接受无数的信息和纪要，而传统的文件夹管理、金融行业常用的有道云对于我来说只能起到一个简单的收集作用而无法后期自动化的为我提供收集归纳的帮助。其实，日常消费研究员的工作就是跟踪行业，跟踪不同的标的(股票)，以及相对应的提供点评。作为一个笔记软件，我希望能够做到自动化、结构化的收纳，便携的搜索，方便快捷添加后期点评。
所以从总体的架构上，我做了如下四个维度的Database： Sectors， Sub-Sectors，Equities和Memos。Sector即大行业，比如食品饮…</span>

前言
我们日常开发中，永远离不开debug调试，断点技术一直是我们排查bug的有力手段之一！随着网络安全意识的逐步提高，对app安全的要求就越来越高，反调试 （有朋友不太了解这个概念，这里我解释一下，就是通过调试技术，比如我们可以反编译某个apk，即使apk是release包，同样也可以进行反编译后调试，比如最新版本的jadx）的技术也渐渐深入我们开发者的眼帘，那么我们来具体看看，android中，同时也是linux内核中，是怎么处理调试程序的！
执行跟踪
无论是断点还是其他debug手段，其实都可以总结为一个技术手段，就是执行跟踪，含义就是一个程序监视另一个程序的技术，被跟踪的程序通过一步步执行，知道收到一个信号或者系统调用停止！
在linux内核中，就是通过ptrace系统调用进行的执行跟踪
#include  
long ptrace(enum __ptrace_request request, pid_t pid, void *addr, void *data);

随着我们对linux的了解，那么就离不开对权限的讨论！一个程序跟踪另一个程序这种东西，按照linux风格，肯定是具有某种权限才可以执行！这个权限就是设置了CAP_SYS_PTRACE 权限的进程，就可以跟踪系统中除了init进程（linux第一个进程）外的任何进程！当然！就算一个进程没有CAP_SYS_PTRACE权限，也可以跟踪一个与被监视进程有相同属组的进程，比如父进程可以通过ptrace跟踪子进程！执行跟踪还有一个非常重要的特点，就是两个进程不能同时跟踪一个进程！
我们再回到ptrace函数调用，可以看到第一个参数是一个枚举值，其实就是发出ptrace的当前行为，它有以下可选命…</span>

为什么建议你一定要学会写作?
“5种搭建⽂章架构的⽅法”免费赠送!
一、基调
Hello~我是小木箱，今天分享的主要内容是: 手把手教你快速搞定4个职场写作场景。在讲具体内容前先介绍一个词基调，什么是基调呢？百度百科的解释是作品中主要的音调。在写作里面，基调就是写作时的基本思想。艺术作品需要它独特的基调，写作也需要它独特的基调。

如果我们在写作之前，提前掌握了内容的基调，那么便把握了文章的命脉。开始写作后的大方向是一定不会错的。
二、四类常见的职场写作
职场写作在类型上分为四大类: 总结类、调查报告类、申请类和计划类。

我们的工作总结其实就是典型的总结类，包括有: 年度总结、月度总结、周报和日报。常见的调查报告类有竞品分析报告和市场调研报告。申请类可以分为申请转正、申请加薪、申请费用等。计划类可以分为工作计划、项目计划、活动计划三个方向。这四个类别，几乎把我们在工作中能够接触到的写作场景，全都 cover 住了。

分好类后，我们来逐个定基调，看看这几个写作场景要怎么写?

2.1 总结类

第一，总结类，总结类的文章基调是: 有深度、有内容、有规划，以年终笔。有些职场人在年终总结的时候潜移默化地写成了流水账。直接把月报汇总，然后阐述分别都做了哪些事，这是一份典型的负面教材。
你的年终总结不但要给你的上级看，而且还要给公司看，平时都做的哪些事。你的领导心里基本都清楚，把这些内容逐个再写一遍既无意义，也无法突出你的能力。
你的领导要看什么呢？第一，看你的成果，第二，看你的分析，第三，看你从过去一年的工作中沉淀的经验，这时候文档重要性不言而喻了，第四，看你对明年的展望，是否干劲十足。
所以在总结的时候，要以结果导向，不要过度关注过程，着重汇报成果。成果最好可以量化，要用数字表达，因为相比…</span>

                              <span>发生了啥？
在升级agp7.2.2 之后（之前是7.0.4），我们发现之前 在编译期 执行 png 自动压缩成webp的 task执行失败了，导致包体积减少的计划失败， 遂逐个排查之后 发现是agp从7.2.0 版本开始 这个png 压缩成 webp的task就失败了，那么到底是为啥失败，又要怎么改呢？
主流图片转换压缩的原理
目前主流在编译期间 图片压缩的方案 主要是在 编译期间 png 转换 成webp格式，主要利用的是在编译期间的flat 文件，这个flat 文件包含了 原始的 资源文件位置，形如：

我们拿到这个资源文件的原始位置之后 就可以对这个图片进行压缩， 那为什么升级到7.2.2 之后就不行了呢？
我们用7.2.2 编译项目以后 再次观察下 这个flat文件

你会发现 这个flat文件中的 path信息 发生了变化，似乎是从 绝对路径 变成了相对路径？
这样自然是无法压缩图片了，因为你路径都找不到了
问题原因找到了 就得想想办法 怎么解决了
怎么解决 该问题？
现在的问题就是怎么从flat 文件中的相对路径信息  还原成绝对路径的信息
经过一番搜索 我发现 在编译的产物中 新增了这么一组文件：

这个文件包含了 所有的 flat 文件中  相对路径和 绝对路径的信息， 有了这个文件 我们就可以做进一步的操作了
我们可以将 这个文件中的信息提取出来， 在解析flat文件的时候 判断一下，如果agp的版本&gt;&#x3D;7.0 则将相对路径
替换成绝对路径即可
这个文件的路径 在agp7.2.0 中 就可以 找到 信息

有了这个关键的文件路径就可以了吗？其实还没完，因为你要保证你的图片压缩任务 在这个 文件生成之后才行
否则 如果在这之前 你读取这个文件是读不到的。
利用--dry-run 看一下 task的执行顺序：

猜一下就能猜到 mapDefaultOldSignDebugSourceSetPaths 这个任务 应该就是生成那个 路径信息文件的task了
我们只要设定我们压缩图片的任务 在这个 任务之后执行，即可保证 我们的图片压缩任务在执行的时候 一定能到对应键值对的信息
剩下的就是完善你的代码   就可以了
最后看下具体的信息配置吧，
agp 7.2.0 以后 flat 文件解析出来的 路径信息如下：
com.xxx.yyy.app-jetified-zzz_coment-6.2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-58:/drawable-xxhdpi-v4/space_component_address_select_icon.png
可以明显看出来 : 作为分隔符
而配置文件信息中
com.xxx.yyy.app-jetified-zzz_coment-6.2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-58 /Users/njvivo/.gradle/caches/transforms-3/85f6d8be7a5f41646330c938b4265d02/transformed/jetified-vivospace_component-6.2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/res
注意这里是配置文件中的 分隔符是 空格符
瑕疵
经过上面的分析，目前的图片压缩任务 基本可以正常运行，但还是有一些瑕疵，譬如我们在 读取那个 路径信息 文件的时候 发现 这个信息有时候会不全， 目前我发现 部分app module下的图片 信息 在路径信息文件中 会找到不到，目前还不清楚这个 问题的产生原因， 举个例子，
在我的项目中，有些flat文件解析出来，他的相对路径信息 是
com.xxx.yyy.app-main-111 开头的
然而这个 开头的信息 在路径文件中 并找不到，能找到的 只有 com.xxx.yyy.app-main-110
这个问题 目前我是用的硬编码的方式去解决的， 也就是说如果找不到 对应的相对路径 我们就直接用默认的app module下的路径 去覆盖， 这样虽然能解决问题 但看起来并不是很优雅，
有知道具体原因的大佬可以指点下
后来想了想 也许是最后这个110 111 并没有 什么特殊的信息 在做key匹配的时候 去除掉这个 尾号 也一样可以解决问题 这种方法比硬编码 优雅多了，经过测试 也没发现啥bug，目前暂时先用这个方案吧</span>

前言
App 内的下载功能也是我们常用的场景，比如下载最新的 Apk 安装包，还有些会下载图片，或者资源，插件等场景。
下载不是很简单的功能吗？OkHttp就能下载，基于OkHttp实现的一些框架那更多，比较出名的有FileDownloader okdownload RxDownload 等等。
同时我们 Android 系统服务 DownloadManager 同样可以使用下载服务，他们之间有什么区别？
一、DownloadManager的默认使用
DownloadManager 是android2.3以后，系统下载的方法。可以让 Android 设备请求的 URI 被下载到一个特定的目标文件。客户端将会在后台与http交互进行下载，或者在下载失败，或者连接改变，重新启动系统后重新下载。还可以进入系统的下载管理界面查看进度。
内部主要包含 DownloadManager.Query 和 DownloadManager.Request 两个重要类。一个是封装一些下载请求的参数，一个是用于查询下载的信息。Request 是必须的，Query是非必须的。
通常使用 DownloadManager 推荐我们使用通知栏展示真正进行下载，并且我们可以跳转到下载器页面查看。
    private fun startDownLoad() {

        //下载链接 这里下载手机B站为示例
        val downloadUrl &#x3D; &quot;https://dl.hdslb.com/mobile/latest/iBiliPlayer-html5_app_bili.apk&quot;

承接上文：《Flutter 多引擎渲染，在稿定 App 的实践》
在这么偏僻的技术路线上，还是有蛮多读者和社区认可的。所以笔者会把这方案的原理详细介绍给大家，让大家能少走一些弯路 ～
前言
先讲下对于 Flutter 开发架构的理解，大概存在这3种：
Flutter 为主开发的 APP。
Flutter 与 Native 容器混合型，页面可以是 Flutter，也可以是 Native，代表比如 flutter_boost。
FlutterEngineGroup 多引擎渲染，容器是 Native 提供，Flutter 只关心 View 部分即可。
这里不是比较各自的优劣，选型上只选择最适合的方式。
像笔者公司前期是用 flutter_boost 做页面容器混合型，但现在架构上的变化，会逐渐减少 Native 的实现，变为跨端架构，而纯 Flutter 并不满足于我们的开发，且从代码量上也不可能改为 Flutter 为主的 APP 架构。（dart 说实话也不是一个好的开发语言[手动狗头][勿喷]）。
基于这个前提能选择的很少，Flutter 多引擎是实现跨端 UI 现在是最现实的方案而已。毕竟官方也是只有 Demo，甚至官方推荐的 pigeon Demo 也没和 multiple_flutters Demo 联系起来。
至于为什么不继续使用容器混合型开发？大家有没有感觉到 add_to_app 的方式开发调试起来也是蛮痛苦的，单元测试也不好做。而且要保持业务层不动的情况下，开发很多额外的 plugins 来支撑 UI，这个成本还是很高的。
实现及原理

整套方案实现下即为跨端 UI 组件化，如上图所示。
跨端 UI 组件化优势：
APP 双端 UI 一致性实现，并且可以部署为独立的 Web Demo，提前进行 UI 走查。…</span>

前言
Transform API 是 AGP1.5 就引入的特性，主要用于在 Android 构建过程中，在 Class转Dex的过程中修改 Class 字节码。利用 Transform API，我们可以拿到所有参与构建的 Class 文件，然后可以借助ASM 等字节码编辑工具进行修改，插入自定义逻辑。
国内很多团队都或多或少的用 AGP 的 Transform API 来搞点儿黑科技，比如无痕埋点，耗时统计，方法替换等。但是在AGP7.0中Transform已经被标记为废弃了，并且将在AGP8.0中移除。
而Transrom被废弃之后，它的代替品则是Transform Action，它是由Gradle提供的产物变换API。
Transform API是由AGP提供的，而Transform Action则是由Gradle提供。不光是 AGP 需要 Transform，Java 也需要，所以由 Gradle 来提供统一的 Transform API 也合情合理。
当然如果你只是想利用ASM对字节码插桩，AGP提供了对基于TransformAction的ASM插桩的封装，只需要使用AsmClassVisitorFactory即可，关于具体的使用可见：Transform 被废弃，ASM 如何适配?
而本文主要包括以下内容:
TransformAction是什么?
如何自定义TransformAction
TransformAction在AGP中的应用
TransformAction是什么？
简单来说，TransformAction就是Gradle提供的产物转换API，可以注册两个属性间的转换Action，将依赖从一个状态切换到另一个状态
我们在项目中的依赖，可能会有多个变体，例如，一个依赖可能有以下两种变…</span>

                              <span>某日在盗版网站上津津有味的看着《盗墓笔记重启之极海听雷》，翻着翻着，下一章文风突变，变成了《美艳总裁老婆的废柴入赘老公在家族聚会上送礼》的小故事，一时没把持住，看了600多章。我心想我阅读速度也不慢啊，咋感觉剧情进展这么慢，扫了一眼目录当场石化，好家伙，这文你都能水成2200章，真是要顶礼膜拜了。抽了自己几个大嘴巴以后，想了想还是总结一下为啥爽文是如此的让人无法自拔。咱今日不谈网络文学的好坏，就来聊聊这个「爽」。
爽感的对比
首先要自爆家底，这么多年「良好的阅读习惯」让我有幸接触了《斗破苍穹》、《武动乾坤》、《全职法师》、《牧龙师》、《七界传说》、《星辰变》、《盘龙》、《诛仙》、《盗墓笔记》、《鬼吹灯》等，应该也算是见证过当年网文的盛况，自认为对这一类型文有一定的发言权。
传统文学的爽感体验是以一种循序渐进的方式，缓慢而合理的推进剧情，不断累积读者的情绪和体验，最后在结局中以狂风暴雨般的方式宣泄出来。传统题材的小说也不会特意照顾读者感受，不会去刻意迎合读者口味。而网络爽文使用了一种截然不同的方式，彻底以读者为中心进行创作。读者爱看什么，作者就写什么，其目的只有一个：让读者看的爽。至此，网络文学凭借直白的叙事，通俗的文字，连绵不绝的爽快阅读体验，终于成为了文学作品中不可小觑的一种类型。
如果我们以阅读的进度作为x轴，将「爽」值作为Y轴，按照个人体验我画一张如下的图表（黄色为爽文，绿色为传统文学）。

画的比较抽象还望理解，既然要探究为什么爽文的爽会呈现出类似波浪线的形态，令人爽的难以自拔，可能得先从爽文的代入感说起。
爽感的地基：代入感
所谓代入，即读者以移情的方式，将自身转移到主角身上，从而间接获得主角的世界，以及在剧情推进中获得的各类体验。之所以强调代入感，就好比你隔壁是个富二代，你每天看着人家香车美女的生活必然只会觉得不爽，因为你跟他的生活毫无交集，他的爽你根本无法感同…</span>

                              <span>写在前面
30 岁，有人开始发现自己不再年轻，有人开始焦虑自己的目标、成功和失败，30 岁在 20 岁看来也许觉得好笑，在 40 岁看来也许又觉得矫情。不管怎么说，我的 30 岁还是来了。
在我派发这篇文章时，已是我在 30 岁路上的第 5 天，此刻才有时间写点东西。

论写生日小作文，我最佩服《失控》的作者凯文凯利（KK）。68 岁生日，他写下 68 Bits of Unsolicited Advice，给出了自己 68 岁时的 68 条忠告。69 岁生日，他写下了 99 Additional Bits of Unsolicited Advice，给出了自己 69 岁的 99 条忠告。今年等来了他 70 岁生日主题文 103 Bits of Advice I Wish I Had Known。嚯，这次直接增加到了 103 条。

崇拜谁就模仿谁，所以很早之前我给自己定下过 30 岁写 30 条感悟的目标。嗯，如你所见，没写出来。还是熊言熊语，随便聊聊。

也许
29 岁最后一天和 30 岁第一天的我们不会有多少质的变化。真正让我们成熟的是那些生活和其中为数不多的经历，或让人恍然大悟，或让人追悔莫及，或让人晕头转向，也可能让人继续前行。
有些人 30 岁的经历你可能在 20 岁已经习得，有些人 30 岁的感受你可能要等到 40 岁才有所体会。
许久没联系的发小前几天微信问我作为三旬老汉有何感受。我这个发小本科毕业 7 年时间里先后换了三份工作，英年早婚，孩子已经能打酱油，如今安家在一个南方城市。我猜他不是真心求教，便说：读书读的太久了，才开始感受社会的暴击。
他回复我：很好，那就不用我了，生活能教你做个人。

29 岁这一年，当我拿到一本建行绿色「个人住房抵押贷款合同」，翻开 X00 万贷款还款 30 年那一页时，脑子里突然冒出了万青的一句歌词：如此生活 30 年，直到大厦…</span>

                              <span>虽然裸辞以后收入不能保证，也中断了自己的职业生涯，但是这一年，从每天晚上规划「明天干吗好呢」开始，我发现自己是可以掌控生活的。
我可以决定自己每一天要不要工作、要不要提升自己、要不要追寻快乐，不管做了什么选择，我都不再抱怨，而且珍惜时间。
比起在公司常常不好意思拒绝他人、被kpi追着跑、看不清大局，我在与自己的相处过程中，似乎渐渐明白「为自己的选择负责」，意味着什么。
不断为时间做决策的过程，也是不断地自我验证。
我更清楚自己擅长、缺失、喜爱、抗拒的事物，根据自己的评估，补上了一些所需技能，也放任自己不勉强接受抗拒的东西，让生活状态尽量保持在「心情不错且有收获」的可持续流动中。
最幸运的是，身边的人不会觉得我很奇怪，写稿技能也在市场上获得回馈。
所以以下是给自己的一年期交代～涵盖这一年的时间安排(多图表预警)、转自由职业体悟、生活创作和心境转变，共4300+字，来不及看先收藏或打赏(喂)也行。
 
一、裸辞后的时间都干吗去了？
在去年6月底离职前，我有4年全职工作经验，媒体编辑，大体是个没什么生活的人。
辞职以后，我大致经历了休养→探索→认命→前进四个阶段：

7-10月 休养期
架了个人网站、从0到1启动单口播客、整理生活(相册/收藏夹等)、看书
裸辞前身体较差，给自己的唯一kpi是「全然地休息」，不着急确定下一步

11月-1月 探索期
随着收入渐少，有去面试，但没有想上班的心情，觉得自己可能要主动做点什么
因此找了喜欢的健身领域，每周工作三天，其他几天继续探索不同可能
顺便回家一趟，经历两岸隔离28+14天

2月-3月 认命期
明晰了自己只是不想浪费时间在反复沟通而非工作本身，因此认命接受自由职业
开始拓展自由职业客户来源，或者说让更多人知道我可以做什么

4月-6月 前进期
封控在家两个月，尝试接触更多客户、完成不同稿子

                              <span>本文参与数字文具盒征文活动。

我是一个在读的社科博士生。大约一年多以前，我正式进入到博士研究的阶段。很快我发现，博士与硕士本科阶段不同，我面临着文章发表的压力却又缺乏充分的导师指导，由此我开始认真思考如何建立自己的知识管理与任务管理系统。感谢少数派上众多热心作者的分享，让我在这一年里了解并尝试了各种各样的笔记工具、任务管理工具以及方法论体系，并成功浪费了大量学习时间。
然而，虽然每次看到喜欢的新工具都会马上下载使用，我却总是难以坚持下来。在经历了无数次的尝试-放弃循环后，我发觉最重要的不是工具本身，而是容纳这些工具的「盒子」——即如何最简单明了地将文件管理、项目管理、知识管理等等工具融合在一起。
但恰恰是这些基础的东西，大部分的分享都没有详细提及，它们可能没有什么技术含量，但却是入门者最最需要的。因此，我想和大家分享一下我是如何将 Mac 桌面作为我的数字文具盒，搭建简易数字化学术工作流程的，或许能对刚开始入门的朋友有所帮助。
首先谈谈一个普遍存在的问题：

为什么我看到某某博主介绍的某款笔记工具非常酷炫，非常符合自己的需求，但是就是用不下去呢？

可能有这几方面的原因：

工具学习成本过高，难以上手。
工具与自己正在使用的工具功能、工作习惯冲突，无法完全融入到自己的工作流中。
自己太懒工具使用需要耗费时间精力，没有养成使用习惯，产生拖延。

就我自己的探索经历来说，这几方面的问题一般共同存在。
举个例子，初次知道 logseq 这个双链笔记应用的时候，我觉得它就是完美的笔记工具，于是马上下载试用，每天在它的 dailynote 里面记录各种各样的东西，包括每日任务、未来计划、会议记录、研究灵感、阅读笔记，项目总结等等，然后用双链加以整理。
但是一段时间后发现，它和之前的工具产生了冲突。比如我的文献 pdf 是用 Zotero 来管理的，这就导致每次查阅文献都要同时打开两…</span>

一个个小问题堆出棘手大问题
同学们好，我是 AZ，AZ 是我。作为一个在「文理学院」上学、学的是两个本身就是跨专业学科的双专业学生，要学的知识范围实在是广到自己都数不明白的程度。从专业本身的基因和数据科学，到分子生物和计算机、有机化学和统计概率、生物工程和数据伦理，再到学院要求的国际关系、文学写作、历史艺术，有至少一半都是超出我已有的知识框架的内容。这些《乱七八糟》的东西一股脑丢过来，基本上摔在地上的和接住且拿住的五五开。为了自己的学业（aka 绩点），也为了自己越来越重的黑眼圈和越来越秃的脑袋，得想想办法。
AZ 的学习工作流 &amp; 关于工作流的思考
工作流，顾名思义，是一套能胜任一系列需求的「数字文具」使用范式。但作为一个被迫要学文科社科工科计算机还有设计的理科生，似乎没有一套这样的范式能很好的适配所有的学科。作为一个很不喜欢和生态逆行的人，我尝试过但无法适应同时使用过多的平台来做信息的储存和处理，因而在很长的一段时间每当我看到新的软件出现下意识的第一反应都是「我在 Notion 里能怎么实现这个功能」。到现在，我绝大部分的信息，不管是生活相关的、学业相关的、还是课外活动相关的，都有条不紊的排列在我的 Notion 里。
但是回到最开始提到的问题上，虽然我很爱 Notion 觉得 Notion 功能非常的强大也把大量的信息托付给这个平台，不得不承认，Notion …</span>

2019 年，导演李一凡拍摄了三年的纪录片在广东时代美术馆上映。随后，这部名为《杀马特我爱你》的片子在网上掀起热烈讨论。豆瓣上有影评这样写道：「还没有一部纪录片可以像《杀马特我爱你》让我这么感动，以致于看到中间，我不自觉地拿起手机拼命的记笔记，生怕遗漏掉其中每一段杀马特充满力量的表达，那些关于自由、关于快乐、关于压迫的生命哲学表达。」这部影片也成为印象中「叛逆的、非主流、亚文化」杀马特群体祛魅的代表作。
与之类似的，由 B 站 UP 主衣戈猜想发布的视频作品《二舅》近期也掀起不小的舆论波澜，从立意到故事本身的真伪都饱受讨论。我们不去剥丝抽茧论证事件本身的真实度，但从画风上来看，它在拍摄手法上也使用了田野民族志的方式。
相比已经成为亚文化符号的「杀马特」，类似「二舅」这样传奇又曲折的人格与经历，不曾像如今这般立于舆论场的镁光灯下。无论看完之后会生出怎样的感受：是疼痛、同情、喟叹或哑然、无感、内心矛盾，这都是一场对乡土生活的祛魅的过程。
它背后的传播母题是怎样的？我们又要如何理解「苦难符号」与情感动员之间的关系？一地鸡毛的舆论场冷却之后，比起片子里讲了什么，还有哪些欲语还休的留白更值得讨论？
我们与故事的距离：「影像真实」争议背后的共性价值
7 月末，《二舅》这个 11 分钟的视频在网络上窜火。不到一个礼拜，公众讨论的话题从文案的精妙、背后的社会议题，再到内容本身的真假。从情怀到打假背后，是不断翻新的衍生讨论，不限于精神内耗、乡土风味、非虚构写作的边界等等。
从传播的角度出发，我们首先需要明确的是：作为观众，我们与作品的距离不等于我们与故事本身的距离。我们首先接触到的层面，始终是「影像真实」。
有网友对此评述：二舅的出现的确改变了我一些看待人性生活的方式。一个治愈当下的故事，如果其内核被抽丝剥茧，被现实解读，那么故事便不再是故…</span>
