Template String Type Improvements
Below are some examples of improved assignment relations:
type Color &#x3D; &quot;red&quot; | &quot;blue&quot;;
type Quantity &#x3D; &quot;one&quot; | &quot;two&quot;;

type SeussFish &#x3D; &#x60;${Quantity | Color} fish&#x60;;
// same as
//  type SeussFish &#x3D; &quot;one fish&quot; | &quot;two fish&quot;
//         | &quot;red fish&quot; | &quot;blue fish&quot;;
…or match patterns of other string-like types.

declare let s1: &#x60;${number}-${number}-${number}&#x60;;
declare let s2: &#x60;1-2-3&#x60;;

// Works!
s1 &#x3D; s2;

We have been using email/username with the combination of a password to verify the authenticity of a user.  The process is not as simple as it looks as you have to pass data in encrypted form to avoid any data mishandling. You also need to store data in some form of encryption so that either owner or admin of the database can not have access to the password. 
Today, we are going to implement an authentication system in React. It will have the following 
Frontend in React: It will include the register and login form.
Backend in Express: It will manage the APIs to register and verify the user.
JWT: For managing the verification of the user with tokens.
So, let&#x27;s get started.

                              <span>In this post we are going to check Css Selectors for input ranges. This selectors would not be known by many of us.
We all use input elements in our projects and must be aware of input type&#x3D;&quot;number&quot; this defines a field for entering number.
This allows in restricting user to enter any other character other than numbers. When we use the tag input and give its type attribute value of &quot;number&quot; as below

This gives us below output

This input box comes with the 2 buttons on the right side which we can use to increase or decrease the number entered in the input.
We can set the min and max values for the number to be entered in the input as below

This will restrict the user to enter only numbers that are between 2 and 5 as we have specified in the min and max attributes of the input.
Now we can use the CSS Selector to detect if the user has not entered between the specified min and max values and apply css for the same.
html

css
input:in-range {
  border: 1px solid green;
}

input:out-of-range {
border: 1px solid red;
}﻿

The above css code will check all the values entered in the Input Box, If the number entered in the input box is not between the range specified by min and max values it changes the color of input box to red as below

If the number entered is between the min and max values it will change the input box&#x27;s color to green as below
 
This was the usage of in-range and out-of-range css selectors, hope you find this usefull.
Happy Coding!

                              <span>Let’s start without wasting much time, 4 steps to add a slider as shown in the image to your react project. I will be using the react-awesome-slider package.
Install the package

yarn add react-awesome-slider

Import the AnimationSlider component from the package
Simple as explained, import the component that will have slide functionality. This component is called AwesomeSlider.
import AwesomeSlider from &quot;react-awesome-slider&quot;;

Import the type of CSS animation we want to use in root and pass it to the AnimationSlider component.
I am using nextjs, so I will add the CSS animation in globally i.e. in the _app.js file

import &quot;react-awesome-slider/dist/styles.css&quot;;
import &quot;react-awesome-slider/dist/custom-animations/fall-animation.css&quot;;


Add the slider children either images or text
You can use text or images as the slider children. Also, pass the animation you want to use, I want to see cubeAnimation so I have passed that as the animation prop.
import React from &quot;react&quot;;
import AwesomeSlider from &quot;react-awesome-slider&quot;;
const HomePage &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
 return (
  
   
   
   
  
 )
};
export default HomePage;

                              <span>Introduction


The most challenging aspect of developing any application is often managing its state. However, we are often required to manage several pieces of state in our application, such as when data is retrieved from an external server or updated in the app. 
The difficulty of state management is the reason why so many state management libraries exist today - and more are still being developed. Thankfully, React has several built-in solutions in the form of hooks for state management, which makes managing states in React easier.
It&#x27;s no secret that hooks have become increasingly crucial in React component development, particularly in functional components, as they have entirely replaced the need for class-based components, which were the conventional way to manage stateful components…</span>

This article will share how to programmatically convert PDF to images in Java application from the following two aspects.
Convert a Whole PDF Document to Multiple Images
Convert a Particular PDF Page to an Image
A free Java library is required to achieve this task, and there are 2 methods to install the product. 
Method 1: Download the free library(Free Spire.PDF for Java) and unzip it. Then add the Spire.Pdf.jar file to your project as dependency.
Method 2: Directly add the jar dependency to maven project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. 
Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions which has been developed by HashiCorp.
A provider is responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources.
Most of the available providers correspond to one cloud or on-premises infrastructure platform and offers resource types that correspond to each of the features of that platform.
- Support multiple platforms &amp; has hundreds of providers 
- Simple configuration language with fast learning curves 
- Easy integration with configuration management tools like Ansible

We able to do this by making use of:
the event object and its .target property
the different phases of an event (Capturing / At target / Bubbling)

Your application uses a database like PostgreSQL? So how do you test your persistence layer to ensure it&#x27;s working properly with a real PostgreSQL database? Right, you need to test against a real PostgreSQL. Since that test requires external infrastructure it&#x27;s an integration test. You&#x27;ll learn how easy it is to write integration tests for your Go application using Testcontainers and Docker.
Our application stores users in a PostgreSQL database. It uses the struct UserRepository with a method FindByUsername that uses plain SQL to find a user by username. We will write an integration test running against a real PostgreSQL in Docker for the method FindByUsername.
The integration test for the FindByUsername of our UserRepository looks like:

                              <span>There have been amazing articles on the subjects of migrating from a monolith to a microservice architecture e.g. this is probably one of the better examples. The benefits and drawbacks of the architectures should be pretty clear. I want to talk about something else though: the strategy. We build monoliths since they are easier to get started with. Microservices usually rise out of necessity when our system is already in production.
However, there are a lot of questions that arise when deciding when to do the migration or not – how do you decide the boundaries of a service? How do you verify the self-healing properties of your microsevice architecture?
This is especially challenging with the distributed aspect of the service mesh. We need a view of the entire application as parts of it bre…</span>

                              <span>微软发行的“最重”的软件重逾 18 公斤

在互联网并不发达的时候，软件的分发主要依赖于软盘或者 CD，并且其中会附有详细的纸质文档，这些文档可以达到数千页，因此导致软件非常重。据微软披露，它至今发行的最大软件是 1992 年发行的 Microsoft C/C++ 编译器及 Windows SDK，重逾 18 公斤，该软件放在一个长度超过 60 厘米的盒子里。


消息来源：PCMag



老王点评：这软件果然“重量级”。不过现在的软件都没有了介质，你是否“拥有”一个软件有时候并不确定，比如说云软件、订阅软件。还真是怀念当年计算机爱好者们背着几盒软盘彼此交流的时候。




谷歌开源识别各种加密产品漏洞的 Paranoid

Paranoid 项目可以检测任意加密产品，甚至包括那些源代码没有公开的系统生成的加密产品。它支持测试数字签名、通用伪随机数和公钥等多种类型的加密产品，可以识别由编程错误或使用弱专有随机数生成器引起的问题。谷歌使用 Paranoid 从证书透明度项目中检查了超过 70 亿个证书的加密产品，并发现了数千个受到严重和高严重性 RSA 公钥漏洞影响的项目。


消息来源：谷歌



老王点评：这让我想起来前两天现代汽车中使用硬编码的示例密钥进行加密的事情，要是经过了 Paranoid 的检查，想必不会出现这种低级错误了吧。




Ubuntu 22.10 禁用 GNOME 43 中的设备安全提示功能

GNOME 43 中提供了一个“设备安全”提示功能，可以对是否启用了安全启动、TPM 等设备安全功能给出警告。正在开发中的 Ubuntu 22.10 会采用 GNOME 43，但开发者表示将先禁用这个“设备安全”提示功能。这是因为要获得最高的安全级别 3 需要英特尔 BootGuard、TPM 重建、IOMMU 保护、启动前 DMA 保护、英特尔 CET、暂停到闲置、加密内存等功能，而 Ubuntu 22.10 目前只能达到安全级别 1。甚至如果用户试图调整系统达到更高的安全性，也可能会破坏系统。因此，Ubuntu 可能会在以后才支持该功能。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：虽然说过于理想化的安全设置可能不切实际，但是这些安全功能可以在现代的 Windows 上正常运行，而在 Ubuntu 上却无法很好的工作。这说明，虽然我们觉得 Windows 安全性不好，但是很可能实际上并非如此 —— 只是用的人多罢了。</span>

                              <span>Wii U 模拟器 Cemu 的开发者上周二宣布了一个重要的 2.0 版本发布，首次交付了 Linux 上的二进制文件，并开源了他们八年的成果。Cemu 是一个 Wii U 模拟器，并于 2017 年创造了历史 —— 每个月可以通过 Patreon 获得支持其发展的数千美元赞助。Cemu 以其在 Patreon 上曾短暂达到 25,000 美元的最高收入而为人所知，这引起了人们对“仿真是否道德”的关注，特别是它被用来换取金钱，而项目却是“闭源的”而不是“开源”的 —— 也就是说源代码没有向公众开放。

仿真社区保护自己免受法律诉讼的主要方式之一是向公众提供其源代码，允许像任天堂这样的“诉讼公司”检查它，并验证在反向工程过程中没有使用他们的专有代码。

据 Exzap 称，Cemu 对 Linux 的支持“仍然相当粗糙”，但他相信随着更多的模拟器开发者熟悉 Cemu，并开始为该项目做出贡献，这种情况将迅速改变。Cemu 以前只兼容 Windows，但现在支持 Linux，可以在 Steam Deck 上快速安装。在 Cemu 引入 Flatpak 支持一键安装之前，在 Deck 上使用它并不那么简单，不过这个话题已经在 GitHub 上讨论过了。

Cemu 的作者利用 2.0 发布公告简要地讨论了该模拟器的历史；在该模拟器的大部分历史中，他们是唯一的开发者，他们声称过去两年对项目的压力特别大。

Exzap 将继续做出贡献，但预计拥有其他开发者将有助于创建几个重要的功能，如暂停和恢复仿真的能力，以及提高在旧硬件上的性能。

“我已经在 Cemu 上工作了近 8 年，看着这个项目从一个似乎不可行的实验，发展到在其高峰期有超过一百万人使用的东西，”Exzap 在上周二的公告中写道，“即使在今天，当 Wii U 已经被大部分人遗忘的时候，我们每个月仍然有 25 万次下载。仍然有这么多人在用 Cemu 享受 Wii U 游戏，我将永远感激让我有机会以积极的方式影响这么多人的生活，哪怕只是一丁点。”

                              <span>在 Linux 中安装和应用现代的漂亮的 GRUB 主题。


GRUB ，意即 大统一引导程序GRand Unified Bootloader ，它是大多数 Linux 操作系统的默认引导加载程序。GRUB 引导加载程序是计算机启动时运行的第一个程序。正如你可能注意到的，GRUB 菜单的默认主题是朴素的。它只有一个黑色的背景和一些白色的字符。你们中的一些人可能不喜欢默认的 GRUB 主题。在这篇教程中，我将演示如何 更改 GRUB 主题 或应用华丽的主题，以使你的 GRUB 菜单在 Linux 中更加精美。

数年前，我们发布了一篇指南，阐释了如何在 Ubuntu 中 配置 GRUB2 引导加载程序设置 。在这篇文章中，我们将向你展示如何更改 GRUB 背景。

但是，只更改背景不是真正的自定义。在这篇指南中，我们不仅会更改壁纸，也会更改 GRUB 的字体、主题和整体的设计。


免责声明： 安装 GRUB 主题可能会破坏你的系统。我强烈建议你在一个虚拟机中尝试和测试一个主题来查看它是否没有正常工作。然后再在实际的系统上安装主题。


介绍

在互联网上可以找到很多社区开发的 GRUB 主题。然而，它们却散落在不同的网站上。因此，找到一个好的 GRUB 主题可能会事倍功半。

GRUB 主题的一个重要的贡献者是 Pling 网站。但是，Pling 中的大部分主题是非常简单的或过时的。

幸运的是，我遇到一个名称为 Gorgeous GRUB 的项目，它是一个可以找到各种精美的 GRUB 主题的地方。相信我，作者付出了巨大的努力来收集这些主题，肯定会你喜欢的主题。

In this series, I&#x27;m developing several scripts to help in cleaning up my music collection. In the last article, we used the framework created for analyzing the directory and sub-directories of music files, checking to make sure each album has a cover.jpg file and recording any other files that aren&#x27;t FLAC, MP3, or OGG.
I uncovered a few files that can obviously be deleted—I see the odd foo lying around—and a bunch of PDFs, PNGs, and JPGs that are album art. With that in mind, and thinking about the cruft removal task, I offer an improved script that uses a Groovy map to record file names and counts of their occurrences and print that in CSV form…</span>

When you have a lot of related files, it&#x27;s sometimes easier to treat them as a single object rather than 3 or 20 or 100 unique files. There are fewer clicks involved, for instance, when you email one file compared to the mouse work required to email 30 separate files. This quandary was solved decades ago when programmers invented a way to create an archive, and so the tar command was born (the name stands for tape archive because back then, files were saved to magnetic tape.) Today tar remains a useful way to bundle files together, whether it&#x27;s to compress them so they take up less space on your drive, to make it easier to deal with lots of files, or to logically group…</span>

                              <span>Hi 大家好，我是 3x3 的作者 KIDSTYO
在2022年初的时候，我制作发布了自己的第一款苹果平台应用 3x3
这是一款采用极简主义设计风格（参考Windows Phone）的时间管理应用
在此之前，我在少数派上看到很多朋友都在用自己的方式结合市面上的工具来搭建自己的时间管理体系
其中有一些关键词，比如间歇式日记、柳比歇夫时间记录法、双链等
其中一些理念，让我觉得和 3x3 的理念很类似，所以也是经过半年多的迭代完善后，想向各位介绍这款工具
我自己不太会写文章，所以这篇文章的内容可能会比较简单
我希望能分享一下我为什么要做这个软件以及分享我自己和一些用户的使用体验
3x3 的理念
首先我想分享一段话，这正是 3x3 核心理念：dots will somehow connect in your future

You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.

3x3 可以轻松的记录日常的时间线，可以关联每日、周、月、年、甚至人生的待办或者标签，并且待办之间可以进行双向链接
做3x3的想法就是，过了很多年之后，我还可以方便的找到当天做过有意义的事情
然后可以将所有事情串联起来，比如我学习一样事情，阅读一本书，可以清晰的知道每个阶段的过程，甚至你可以制作你自己的10000小时计划
3x3 的设计想法在 2018 年初，就有了，当时我还做了一个简单的网页，它…</span>

                              <span>在 WWDC22 上，Apple 发布 iOS 16 的时候，公布了一个功能叫实时活动，并向开发者开放 Live Activities API。

那么什么实时活动呢？
实时活动是一种新的交互式消息通知，用户可以在 iPhone 的锁屏界面看到事件的实时更新。比如球赛的比分、打车或订餐的订单状态、运动锻炼的实时数据等。这种消息通知形式允许开发者在实时活动期间更新单个交互式通知，而不是每次有状态更新时都发送新通知。通过减少发送的通知数量，同时使信息更易于访问。
Uber海外版团队设计的实时活动界面
Apple 在 iOS 16 开发者测试版 Beta 4 首次向开发者提供 ActivityKit 开发套件，首次在真机实装，随后在 Beta 6 和 Beta 7 并没有在真机实装实时活动功能。开发者目前只能在模拟器测试这项功能，或者降级回 Beta 4 或 Beta 5。Apple 在开发者网站也明确表示实时活动不会在首个 iOS16 正式版推出，而是在今年晚些时候的正式版突出。下图是模仿目前已有的原神安卓小组件、iOS 小组件做的实时活动版小组件。到了 8 月 16 日一大早用手机更新 Beta 6 之后，手机就不能运行和测试实时活动了，随后也看到其他开发者反馈实时活动在 Beta 6 版本没有实装。本文后面的截图只能在模拟器截取了，但模拟器不能更改壁纸，只有黑色背景。
Xcode真机调试报错ActivityKit没实装
实时活动界面部分是小组件扩展，开发者使用 WidgetKit 功能和 SwiftUI 编写界面布局，ActivityKit 是处理配置、启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动是一种消息通知，是一种可以自定义界面布局和更新状态的消息通知。下图是普通类型的消息通知，或许以后能看到换了界面布局的降雨提醒。
普通的消息通知类型
实时活动要求和限制
与小组件不同的是，小组件是通过时间线机制更新界面数据，实时活动是通过远程推送或 ActivityKit 从主应用程序来启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动无法访问网络或接收位置更新，下图网络请求图片失败。

ActivityKit 更新和远程推送通知更新的更新动态数据大小不能超过 4KB。
实时活动界面不能包含可交互元素，例如按钮和 WebView。当用户点击实时活动界面，将会打开主应用程序。
自定义实时活动的用户界面时，系统会忽略任何自定义动画，但可以使用系统自带的时间文本动画，当实时活动的动态内容发生变化时，系统会执行一些动画。文本视图通过模糊的内容过渡动画内容变化，系统为图像和 SF Symbols 符号动画内容过渡，根据内容或状态更改从用户界面添加或删除视图，视图会淡入淡出。
系统自带的时间文本动画系统为图像内容变化作出的动画效果
在开发者网站的描述中，如果实时活动的高度超过 160，系统可能会截断它。在实际测试中，实时活动界面最小高度为 64，最大高度可以达到 220。目前实时活动功能还不是正式的版本，有可能在之后的测试版本会有改变。

当用户在 App 首次启动时，点击允许应用程序发送通知时，就代表允许 App 发送实时活动通知，不允许则不会收到实时活动的通知。之后在系统设置 - 对应的 App -实时活动，可以关闭/开启实时活动权限。
实时活动权限位置
实时活动有 4 种活动状态，分别是：等待中、正在进行、成功、失败
实时活动在锁屏界面显示的时候，用户可以左划，点击清除按钮将其清除。用户没有清除的情况下，实时活动最多可以处于活动状态 8 小时，如果用户或应用程序尚未结束活动状态，系统会自动结束它。在此结束状态下，实时活动会在锁定屏幕上最多保留 4 个小时，最后系统会将其删除。

目前实时活动功能还在测试状态，开发者们还在为他们的 App 设计和测试这一项功能，下图是收集几款目前在测试中的实时活动的例子。
一些例子展示
关于实时活动这一功能的一些设想。在这个功能正式上线后，除了官方和大部分媒体提到的比赛比分、运动训练状态、行程状态、订单状态等这些功能以外，我们或许还可以看到这些功能：某餐饮 App 提醒你周四中午吃啥；原神体力、宝钱、参量质变仪到点提示上线领取；购物平台推送提醒商品抢购即将开启、正在抢购还剩余 69 件并且在不断减少等之类的功能。

以上就是关于实时活动这个功能的一些介绍和想法。之前的一篇锁屏天气的文章和视频会有评论说解锁在桌面小组件就能看到天气了啊，左划负一屏添加小组件就能看到天气了啊。不过对于我这种手机懒得解锁的用户来说，对于锁屏实时活动这个功能是非常期待的。大家对于实时活动这个系统特性及功能有什么想法和期待呢？</span>

                              <span>在我看来，Nreal Air 眼镜是一个非常「简单」、非常「聪明」的产品
包装大全套
拿到 Nreal Air 有几天时间了，老实讲等快递到那几天是很激动的，这不是我第一次使用 Nreal 眼镜了，在 2019 年的时候，我非常有幸去北京拜访过 Nreal，期间短暂的体验过 Nreal Air 的前身，当时的 demo 版本已经非常接近现在的样子，给我留下了非常深刻的印象。
如今，在我体验了一段时间，新鲜感消失之后，重新审视这个产品时，我觉得他们做了一些非常漂亮的取舍，得以让 Nreal Air 能够脱离小众，走向大众的视野。这在我的印象当中，可能是这个品类的第一次。并且在苹果发布他们的 AR 眼镜之前，分析一下 Nreal 的每一个选择背后的原因，想想苹果在面对取舍时会怎么选择，这是一个非常好的参照。

取舍
从用户端的需求来说，其实第一个选择非常简单：AR 眼镜到底能干什么？或者说我期望用户能用 AR 眼镜来做什么？
这个问题是简单的，但要回答清楚也是困难的。做产品定义时，产品经理大可以做一些「元宇宙」式的幻想：我希望 AR 眼镜是信息的入口，用户可以活在里面。这个回答可能没错，但是稍微认清一些现实的话，做到这一步是要有非常多的前提的，「元宇宙」里面的内容谁来填充？芯片是否具备这么高的算力能够渲染出丰富的画面？光机是不是能把这些画面精细的显示出来？这几个灵魂拷问可能就连产业巨头都只能兼顾 1-2 个，更别提 Nreal 只是一个 2017 年成立的创业公司了。
所以结合现实，他们的答案是，优先把画面显示好，内容生态寻求合作伙伴补充。
在这个答案的背后，就是他们两个最重要产品取舍：
1. 不在眼镜里集成计算模块和电池，将计算的部分放进用户固有设备中，如手机、平板。
2. 不做无线投屏，采用有线链接，保证稳定性和低延迟

这么选择一个重要的好处就是成本直接少一大块，反映到实…</span>

Movie tickets across the US will cost just $3 on Saturday, September 3rd in celebration of National Cinema Day (via Associated Press). If you’ve never heard of such a holiday before (at least in the US), that’s because it never existed until now, apparently.
The $3 ticket price (not including tax) applies across all tickets, formats, and showtimes — and yes, this includes IMAX and 3D movies. So far, a growing list of 3,000 theaters, including popular chains, like Regal, Cinemark, and AMC, have agreed to take part in the new holiday. 
You might not want to count out your local, independently-run theaters, either. In a list of participating theaters viewed by The Verge, we spotted several smaller locations, like the Starmax Cinemas in...

Trademark filings spotted by Bloomberg suggest Apple might incorporate “Reality” in the name and branding of its long-rumored mixed reality headset. Three separate filings show trademarks for “Reality One,” “Reality Pro,” and “Reality Processor,” matching the realityOS name that cropped up in Apple’s code and a trademark application that potentially refers to the headset’s operating system.
The applications weren’t filed by Apple itself, but by a company called Immersive Health Solutions, LLC. Companies like Apple often use the names of shell companies when filing for a patent or trademark to help keep their plans private. But, as Bloomberg points out, the Delaware-based Immersive Health Solutions was registered by Corporation Trust Co....

In August 2021, we asked the staff of The Verge to tell us about their go-to laptop bags. Now, a year later, some are still using the same bags — but not all. 
It’s surprising how attached you can get to a bag — especially the bag that you use to carry your laptop, your sweater, your lunch, your notebook, your exercise shoes, your kids’ diapers, or any of the other stuff you need. Whether you’re heading to the office, visiting a friend, hanging in a coffee shop, going on a hike, or just sitting outdoors to read or work, having a bag that can accommodate everything on your “gotta have this” list can help you avoid a lot of aggravation. 
So, here’s this year’s staff picks — some old, some new. Most of the staff wrote about their backpacks,...

The ashes of Nichelle Nichols, the actress who played Lieutenant Nyota Uhura in the original Star Trek, will get sent into deep space on a rocket that memorializes her and several other Star Trek veterans (via Reuters). Nichols’ son, Kyle Johnson, donated her ashes after she died in July at age 89.
Nichols’ ashes will head to space on a rocket fittingly called the Vulcan Centaur, with the memorial spaceflight company, Celestis, running the “Enterprise Flight” mission. There still isn’t a set date for the send-off, and it will likely depend on the United Launch Alliance’s ongoing development of the Vulcan rocket.
During the mission, Nichols will be joined by the remains of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and his wife, Majel Barrett,...

As Google carries out the needlessly complex process of combining both the Meet and Duo apps, now it’s throwing a feature copied from Zoom in the mix. In an update on the Google Workspace blog, the company announced that Google Meet will soon give you the ability to unmute yourself by holding down the spacebar and to mute yourself again by releasing it.
If you frequently use Zoom, this feature might sound a lot like its push-to-talk feature — and that’s because it’s essentially the same thing. Zoom obviously didn’t revolutionize this feature (we have walkie-talkies to thank for that), but it conveniently makes it available during video conferences, which comes in handy whenever you want to chime in during a meeting but don’t want to stay...

背景
成为少数派 Matrix 作者已经两年有余。回想起在少数派发表的第一篇文章，也是因为征文活动「无限桌面」有感而发，简单介绍了一下当时身在国内，日夜颠倒网课学习时的桌面布置。两年过去了，我已经回到了美国，也从当时的学校毕业，进入到新的学校，开启了人生的一个新阶段。 
新闻传媒，英文名叫做「Journalism」，是一门专门学习新闻报道和写作的学科。而除了学校里开设的各类理论和实践课之外，最好的学习方法就是平时的阅读积累。在我将新闻传媒定为自己学习的方向之后，我便开始有意识地通过各种渠道获取内容，加深自己对于新闻事件的理解，同时也学习职业记者们的写作风格。几年下来，我也有了一套独属于自己的系统。这次少数派的征文主题是「数字文具盒」，那我也趁这个机会，聊一聊自己作为一个新闻传媒系的学生，是如何使用数字工具来搭建自己的阅读和写作系统的。
按照工具和媒体的性质，我把自己的「数字文具盒」简单分为四个步骤：获取内容，收集内容，处理内容，以及产出内容。
我的阅读与写作系统的简单流程图
获取内容
阅读理解新闻的第一步，当然是要找到优质的信息渠道。我目前常用的渠道主要有四个：传统媒体，播客，书籍，以及社交媒体。
传统媒体，指的就是规模大，存在时间久，以报道新闻为主要目的的媒体。我订阅的传统媒体有三家：纽约时报 New York Times，华尔街日报 The Wall Street Journal， 以及大西洋杂志 The Atlantic。 纽约时报作为美国发行量最大的报纸之一，文章质量有一定的保证，并且汇集了许多美国最知名的专栏作家。我每天都会阅读它的早间资讯 Morning Briefing 和 On Politics 两份 newsletter。但因为它的受众主要是美国的自由派人士，文章导向非常明显。而华尔街日报专注于商务人士，文章也偏向保守。大西…</span>

Debian 目前在其系统上默认不加载非自由固件，“即使这意味着，没有这些二进制组件就没有硬件支持/加速能力。不加载非自由固件也可能意味着错过安全更新或解决可用性问题。”现在，Debian 社区正在讨论关于未来如何处理非自由固件的不同做法，包括默认提供并启用非自由固件，取代现有镜像或增加新的带非自由固件的镜像等等。

数万个 WordPress 网站使用了恶意插件

研究人员在 24931 个 WordPress 网站上发现了 47337 个恶意插件，每一个被攻击的网站都有两个或更多被感染的插件。而且，这些插件中有 94% 仍在积极地感染新的网站。研究还发现，这些恶意插件要么是在公开市场上出售的，要么是从盗版网站上传播的，通过利用漏洞注入网站，或者在大多数情况下，在插件被添加到网站后被感染。恶意软件会攻击网站上的其他插件来传播感染，他们的数据集中有超过 4 万个插件被证明是在部署后感染的。

你是不是有一张世纪初的像素化、低分辨率的图片？由于人工智能的进步，你可以轻松地将像素化的图像提升为分辨率更好的图像。

使用普通的图像编辑器需要人工的努力来提升图像。

有大量的在线人工智能图像提升器，但是你不能信任它们对你的数据的处理。

一个新的项目试图解决这个问题，为你提供一个简单的桌面应用程序，让你在一次点击中增强低分辨率照片。

它的第一个版本已经发布。

Upscayl 的功能

Upscayl 是一个跨平台的应用程序，以 Linux 优先的理念构建。

这仅仅意味着 Linux 的构建得到优先考虑，但其他平台也会得到支持。

Upscayl 使用 Python 和 JavaScript 开发，给出了一个简单的界面，你可以选择输入图片和输出文件夹，然后点击 “Upscayl” 按钮来增强图片。

使用 Upscayl

我的电脑上没有太多模糊的照片。并不是说我是一个优秀的摄影师，只是懒得在成千上万的照片中寻找它们。

不过，我还是设法弄到了一张 2011 年的模糊的老照片（那是 11 年前的照片，现在可以说是老照片了）。



不要因为我随手拍了一张厨房柜台的照片而对我做出评价。一定有一个很好的理由（或者我觉得）。

无论如何。我试着用 Upscayl 对图片进行放大。



这需要相当大的处理能力，但我的 8 核、第 11 代 i7 处理器和 16GB 内存可以轻松应对。



单张图片的处理花了大约 4 分钟，435KB 的图片最终变成了 24MB 的图片。说实话，我几乎没有注意到明显的差异。



我想把最后的结果嵌入这里的文章中。但是上传一张 24MB 的图片对我的服务器和你的浏览器来说都有点过分。

安装 Upscayl

不过，我这个不怎么成功的实验不应该阻止你自己去尝试它。

目前，该应用程序可用于 Linux。对 Windows 和 macOS 的支持正在计划中。

你可以得到 Upscayl 的 AppImage 和 Flatpak 软件包。我使用的是 AppImage 版本，你可以使用你喜欢的任何一种。

这些文件可以在发布页面上找到。


下载 Upscayl


如果你喜欢这个项目，别忘了在 GitHub 上给它加星。

                              <span>这是一个周期性的更新指南，主要用于将现有的 Linux Mint 升级安装到一个新的可用版本。


在这篇文章中有三个部分，分别向你展示 Linux Mint 的不同的主要版本之间的升级步骤:


第 1 部分是关于从 Linux Mint 20.3 升级到 Linux Mint 21（GUI 升级工具）

第 2 部分是关于从 Linux Mint 19.3 升级到 Linux Mint 20（基于命令行的升级程序）

第 3 部分是关于从 Linux Mint 18.3 升级到 Linux Mint 19（假设一些人仍然在使用它）


你可以依据你的当前的 Linux Mint 版本和需要来执行适当的步骤。

这是一个周期性的更新指南，主要用于将现有的 Linux Mint 升级安装到一个新的可用版本。

这篇指南已经更新，追加从 Mint 20.3 升级到 Linux Mint 21 的步骤。Linux Mint 现在有一个 GUI 工具来升级到最新的版本。

在你升级到 Linux Mint 21 之前需要知道的事情

在你继续升级到 Linux Mint 21 之前，你应该考虑下面的事情：


你真的需要升级吗？Linux Mint 20.x 还有好几年的支持期限。

你将需要高速互联网连接来下载大约 14 GB 的升级数据。

它可能将花费几个小时的时间来完成升级过程，当然这主要取决于你的互联网速度。你必须有耐心。

制作一个 Linux Mint 21 的 实况 USBLive USB 并在一次实况会话Live session 中尝试它是否与你的硬件系统兼容会是一个好主意。较新的内核可能与较旧的硬件系统有兼容性问题，因此在真正升级或安装之前来对其进行测试可能会为你省去很多麻烦。

全新的安装总是比主要版本升级的更好，但是从零…</span>

                              <span>快速了解一下在 Linux 中玩老式 NES 游戏的 3 个 NES 模拟器。此外，我们也提供了安装指南和特性介绍。


如果你想在最新的 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 版本中玩超级马里奥、口袋妖怪等老式复古游戏，有很多可用的模拟器。如果你想玩老式复古游戏，可以尝试以下三个模拟器。

1、ZSNES

ZSNES 是一个 超级任天堂 模拟器，可以在 Windows、Linux、FreeBSD 和 DOS 上运行。它作为 GUI 界面运行，你可以在其中加载 NES 游戏的 ROM。

这是在 Ubuntu、Debian 和 Linux Mint 中安装 ZSNES 的方法。从终端运行以下命令：

sudo apt install zsnes


对于 Fedora，在 使用这个指南设置 RPM fusion 后运行以下命令进行安装。因为它需要一些 Fedora 官方发行版没有提供的模块。

sudo dnf install zsnes


安装后，从 Dash 中搜索 ZSNES 或在终端中输入 zsnes。





2、Higan

higan 是 Nintendos SNES、NES、Gameboy、Gameboy Color 和 Gameboy Advance 的模拟器。它以前被称为 bsnes，并且 SNES 仿真特别完整和完善。

higan 努力提供最忠实的硬件仿真。它专注于准确性和简洁的代码，而不是速度和特殊功能。它旨在作为参考仿真器来记录底层硬件的工作原理。

这是从命令行安装 higan 的方法。

sudo apt install higan




3、GFCEU

GNOME FCE Ultra（gfceu）是用于 GNOME 桌面的 FCE Ultra 任天堂娱乐系统的图形前端。 Gfceu 简化了用户的游戏体验，并提供了干净、简单和直观的界面。

从终端运行以下命令，为 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 和相关发行版安装 gfceu。

sudo apt install gfceu


对于 Fedora，运行以下命令进行安装。请确保在运行此命令之前 使用这个指南设置 RPM fusion。因为它需要某些官方 Fedora 发行版未提供的软件包。

sudo dnf install gfceu




下载游戏 ROM

有数百个网站提供 NES ROM。这里有几个你可以下载 NES ROM 的地方。下载后，解压缩并从模拟器菜单中打开。


https://romsmania.cc/roms/nintendo

https://romsmode.com/

www.emuparadise.me


使用这些模拟器享受和玩旧 NES 游戏。请让我知道你最喜欢哪一个。

In this series, I&#x27;m developing several scripts to help in cleaning up my music collection. In the last article, I used the framework I created for analyzing the directory and sub-directories of music files and carried out the analysis with the fine open source JAudiotagger library to analyze the tags of the music files in the music directory and subdirectories. In this article, I will do a simpler job:
Use the framework we created in Part 1
Make sure each album directory has a cover.jpg class
Make a note of any other files in the album directory that aren&#x27;t FLAC, MP3 or OGG.
Music and metadata
If you haven&#x27;t read part 1 and part 2 of this series,…</span>

很高兴遇见你~
众所周知，RxJava 是一个非常流行的第三方开源库，它能将复杂的逻辑简单化，提高我们的开发效率，一个这么好用的库，来让我们学习一下吧🍺
下面我抛出一些问题，如果你都知道，那么恭喜你，你对 RxJava 掌握的很透彻，如果你对下面这些问题有一些疑惑，那么你就可以接着往下看，我会由浅入深的给你讲解 RxJava，看完之后，这些问题你会非常明了
1、什么是观察者模式？什么是装饰者模式？
2、观察者模式，装饰者模式在 RxJava 中的应用？
3、RxJava map 和 flatMap 操作符有啥区别？
4、如果有多个 subscribeOn ，会是一种什么情况？为啥？
5、如果有多个 observeOn ，会是一种什么情况？为啥？
6、RxJava 框架流思想设计？
7、RxJava 的 Subject 是什么？
8、如何通过 RxJava 实现一个自己的事件总线？
一、设计模式介绍
我们先了解一下下面两种设计模式：
1、观察者模式
2、装饰者模式
1.1、观察者模式
1.1.1、观察者模式定义
简单的理解：对象间存在一种一对多的依赖关系，当一个对象的状态发生改变时，所有依赖于它的对象都会得到通知并被自动更新
1.1.2、观察者模式示例
//1、定义一个观察者的接口
interface Observer {
    /**
     * 接收事件的方法
     */
    fun onChange(o: Any)
}

//2、定义一个被观察者的接口
interface Observable {
    /**
     * 添加观察者
     */
    fun addObserver(observer: Obser…</span>

Netflix’s Resident Evil series has been canceled a little over a month after its initial debut, according to a report from Deadline. The streamer reportedly decided against renewing the series due to lackluster ratings and viewership.
Like the many other Resident Evil adaptations, Netflix’s live-action series attempts to put yet another spin on the video game franchise it’s based on. The show, which was helmed by Supernatural’s Andrew Dabb, flashes between two different timelines, centering around Umbrella executive Albert Wesker (Lance Reddick) and his two daughters (played by Tamara Smart and Siena Agudong). 
In our review of the series, my colleague Charles Pulliam-Moore notes that it “keeps things feeling fresh up to a point,” but...

On Thursday, Elon Musk got on stage with T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert to announce that SpaceX is working with the carrier to completely eliminate cellular dead zones. The companies claim that next-generation Starlink satellites, set to launch next year, will be able to communicate directly with phones, letting you text, make calls, and potentially stream video even when there are no cell towers nearby. What’s more, Musk promised all this is possible with phones that people are using today, without consumers having to buy any extra equipment.
It’s a bold proclamation from the carrier — Verizon and AT&amp;T don’t offer anything like it. However, SpaceX and T-Mobile aren’t the only companies looking to use satellites to directly communicate with...

Netflix is testing gamertag-style handles that users can create and publicly display when playing its selection of mobile games, as first spotted by mobile developer Steve Moser (via TechCrunch). This should let members identify and invite other users to play games based on their handles, as well as see where they rank on leaderboards.
I got to experience the feature for myself after updating my Netflix app and downloading Into the Breach and Mahjong Solitaire. Netflix gave me the option to create and manage the game handle associated with my particular Netflix profile in both games. Just like creating your gamertag (or public-facing username on any other gaming platform), your game handle must be unique, which Netflix will automatically...

Google’s trying to make it easier for developers to create Android apps that connect in some way across a range of devices. In a blog post, Google explains that it’s launching a new cross-device software development kit (SDK) that contains the tools developers need to make their apps play nice across Android devices, and, eventually non-Android phones, tablets, TVs, cars, and more.
The SDK is supposed to let developers do three key things with their apps: discover nearby devices, establish secure connections between devices, and host an app’s experience across multiple devices. According to Google, its cross-device SDK uses Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ultra-wideband to deliver multi-device connectivity.

P.S. For geeks: The platform is based on the p5.js, p5.play and SceneManager libraries. Therefore it is a great little platform for recreational coding!

                              <span>https://github.com/fuwaa/pint I&#x27;d appreciate it a lot!

Also, while the version number clearly states 2.0.0, I deem this the first major release because the initial version 1.0.0 was simply incomplete and was released due to me not knowing how to properly tag GitHub releases at that moment in time. So I do apologize! And besides, the update breaks the entire functionality of 1.0.0.

                              <span>推特创始人说他最大的遗憾是推特成为一家公司

在回答关于“推特是否变成了他所设想的那样”的问题时，推特创始人 Jack Dorsey 说，“最大的问题和我最大的遗憾是它变成了一家公司”，他进一步说，这应该是“一种协议”，推特不应该由国家或其他公司拥有。如果它是一种协议，那么推特的运作就会很像电子邮件，它不受一个中央实体的控制，使用不同电子邮件供应商的人能够相互沟通。

老王点评：这是真正有开放情怀的人的想法，虽然未必是一条成功之路。不过，已经有类似的“协议”出现，也许真的会出现一个这样的去中心化的推特。




RHEL 10 将取消 GTK2 工具包支持，最大绊脚石可能是 GIMP

虽然 GTK2 工具包在 Linux 应用程序中已经使用了很久，但 GTK3 已经推出了十多年，连 GTK4 也已经推出了两年。大多数著名的 Linux 软件已经从 GTK2 移植到 GTK3 或 GTK4，但也有少数例外，包括 GIMP 和它酝酿已久的 GIMP 3.0 版本仍在使用 GTK2。GTK 最初是来自于 GIMP 项目的一个副产品，是 GIMP 本身的底层框架。红帽称，“这个工具包为我们提供了很好的服务，但在现代技术方面，如 Wayland、HiDPI 屏幕、HDR 和其他方面，它开始显示出它已经开始老化。”RHEL 10 计划在 2025 年推出稳定版。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这应该对大部分使用 GTK 的图形应用没有什么影响，基本上都使用了较新的 GTK 了。但是有趣的是，GIMP 这么多年一直抱着老旧的 GTK2 不升级，反而成为升级换代的最大绊脚石。难怪 GIMP 这么多年还那个样子。




Heroku 宣布取消免费计划

在提供了十多年的服务后，Heroku 本周宣布，它将取消所有的免费服务。Heroku 是一个支持多种编程语言的云平台，允许程序员使用 Java、PHP、Scala 和 Go 等编程语言构建、运行和扩展应用程序。它是最早的云平台之一，其声称被用于开发了 1300 万个应用程序。Heroku 将免费服务的消亡归咎于“滥用”，将于 10 月底开始删除不活跃的账户和超过一年的账户的相关存储，并在 11 月底停止提供免费产品计划，并关闭免费数据服务。

老王点评：又一个免费服务的消失，但是根本原因还是找不到免费服务的生存价值，或者说，免费服务不能给他们带来足够的潜在利益。</span>

GNOME 带来了一个工具，可以让用户匿名提供他们的配置、扩展和 GNOME 调整设置等方面的意见。

这应该有助于 GNOME 了解更多的用户偏好，并做出更好的增强用户体验的决定。

有趣的是，是红帽公司的一名实习生（Vojtech Stanek）创造了这个工具。

GNOME 信息收集：准备好安装了吗？



该工具（gnome-info-collect）是一个简单的终端程序，你需要下载、安装并运行它来与 GNOME 分享数据。

以下是该工具需要从你的 GNOME 系统中收集的内容：


硬件信息（包括制造商和型号）。

系统设置（包括工作区配置、共享功能、SSH 等）。

安装并启用的 GNOME shell 扩展。

应用程序信息（如已安装的应用程序和收藏的应用程序）。

Linux 发行版和版本。

Flatpak 和 Flathub 状态。

默认浏览器。

机器 ID + 用户名的 加盐哈希。


你可以在其 GitLab 页面 上找到适合你的发行版的软件包和收集数据的更多细节。

如果你有一个基于 Ubuntu 的发行版，你可以通过输入以下内容来安装它：

sudo snap install --classic gnome-info-collect


安装完毕后，在终端使用以下命令将其启动：

gnome-info-collect


接下来，它会显示它打算与 GNOME 共享的数据。所以，如果你觉得没问题，你可以选择将数据上传到 GNOME 的服务器上。



考虑到这些数据是匿名的，它应该可以帮助 GNOME 了解他们的用户喜欢什么，并随着时间的推移专注于这些改进。


下载 gnome-info-collect


你对 GNOME 的这个新的数据收集工具有什么看法？请在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

                              <span>任何考虑在开源领域发展的人都具有无限的可能性。下面是我的故事。


当人们问我最喜欢开源的什么时，我的回答很简单：那就是 开放性 。在开源中，社区开发者和贡献者所做的工作是在公共领域的，所有人都能看到并从中受益。我对这一理念爱不释手。

有多少人可以对他们的劳动成果这样说？有多少人，也许在 50 年后，可以回过头来说：“看看我那天写的代码，有几百/几千/几万人从中受益。”我觉得这比从事那些对世界上大多数人来说都是隐秘的软件工作更令人无比兴奋。

我很幸运，我的工作使我置身于一个开源和企业交叉的有趣领域中。如今，我是 OpenNMS 集团 的首席技术官，这家公司负责维护 OpenNMS 项目。OpenNMS 是一个领先的开源网络监控和管理平台。

虽然我现在的角色让我牢牢扎根于开源领域，但我是以用户和贡献者身份开始的。

2007 年，我得到了我的第一份真正的技术工作，在加拿大蒙特利尔的电信服务提供商 Datavalet 技术公司从事网络分析。在五年的时间内，我成长为解决方案架构师，任务是帮助公司选择网络管理解决方案。我们选择了 OpenNMS，正是通过这次经历，我认识到了开源的真正力量。

在平台上线时，我们发现了一些缺失的功能，这些功能将有助于优化我们的体验。一位来自 OpenNMS 集团的代表在现场帮助我们进行部署，并建议我参加社区即将举行的 DevJam，与核心开发人员一起建立我们需要的功能。

在 DevJam 期间，我很快就融入了团队和社区。我们卷起袖子，开始编码，以创建 Datavalet 所需的增强功能。在几天之内，这个附加的功能就准备好了。这是一次令人惊叹的变革性经历，让我真正看到了开源的力量。

一年后，我离职了，在康科迪亚大学全日制学习数学。正是在那里，我再次有机会与 OpenNMS 团队合作，这一次是在该年的谷歌代码之夏的一个项目上。在这个年度计划中，参与者的目标是成功完成开源软件开发项目。

代码之夏对我来说是一次改变职业生涯的经历。OpenNMS 的两位负责人参加了我们的项目演示，一年后，OpenNMS 团队邀请我作为一名全栈开发人员加入。

我努力工作，迅速晋升，并在 2015 年被任命为首席技术官。我认为这是一项个人成就，也再次验证了开源世界的特别之处。如果你喜欢与社区合作，热爱你所做的工作，你的贡献很快就会得到认可。

开源精神也影响了我从个人贡献者到首席技术官的发展，我现在领导着一个由 50 多人组成的产品开发团队。社区本质上是平等的，我与社区贡献者一起工作的经验教会了我如何在环境中领导，而不是控制。

我经历了一段奇妙的开源旅程，从用户到贡献者，再到一家开源公司的高管。开源方法超越了技术，因为专有开发环境中经常存在的障碍的进入和增长可以通过协作、透明和社区来克服。因此，对于任何考虑在开源领域工作的人来说，可能性是无限的。我就是证明。

我们生活在一个人们正在深刻审视自己的生活及其对世界的影响的时代。在开源公司工作特别有意义，因为我可以直接与用户社区互动并影响他们。终端用户和开发人员之间的经典屏障被打破了，我可以确切地看到我的工作如何改变人们的日常生活，或者激励人们为项目做出贡献。通过对一个项目的共同热爱来建立社区，建立持续一生的联系。

我知道这对我来说都是真实的，这也是为什么我对我的工作如此热情。我是一个彻头彻尾的开源极客，并以此为荣。

                              <span>使用 Composerize 从 docker run 命令创建 Docker Compose 文件


如果你每天在正式或个人系统中使用 Docker，你应该知道有一个有用的应用叫 Composerize。在这个简短的指南中，我们将了解什么是 Composerize，以及如何使用 Composerize 在 Linux 中将 docker run 命令转换为 Docker Compose 文件格式。

什么是 Composerize？

Docker Compose 是一个用于定义和运行多容器 Docker 应用的工具。Docker Compose 只是一个 YAML 文件，我们在其中为 Docker 应用定义服务、网络和卷。

不是每个人都擅长写高效的 Docker Compose 文件。你们中的一些人可能会发现，甚至写一个简单的 Docker Compose 文件都很困难。不用担心! 看下 Composerize，它可以帮助你从 docker run 命令中创建 Docker Compose 文件。

Composerize 是一个命令行和基于网络的工具，可以将 docker run 命令转换成 Docker Compose 文件。

无论 docker run 命令是简单、简短还是冗长、复杂，都没有关系。你所要做的就是把命令传给 Conposerize。Composerize 会立即将 docker run 命令变成 Docker Compose 文件！

在 Linux 中安装 Composerize

Composerize 是作为一个网络服务提供的。所以你不需要在你的系统上安装它。如果你因为任何原因想在本地安装它，请继续阅读。

Composerize 可以用 npm 安装。确保你的系统中已经安装了 Nodejs。如果没有安装，请按照下面的链接来安装 Nodejs。


如何在 Linux 上安装 NodeJS


安装完 Nodejs 后，运行以下命令来安装 Composerize：

$ npm install composerize


该命令将只为当前用户安装 Composerize。

如果你想在全局（全系统）安装它，请运行上述命令并加上 -g 选项，如下所示。

$ npm install composerize -g


用 Composerize 将 Docker 命令转换为 Docker Compose 文件

要将 docker run 命令转换为 Docker Compose 格式，只需用 Composerize 运行它，如下所示：

$ composerize docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock portainer/portainer


它将以 Docker Compose 文件格式生成内容。

示例输出：

version: &#x27;3.3&#x27;
services:
    portainer:
        ports:
            - &#x27;9000:9000&#x27;
        volumes:
            - &#x27;/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock&#x27;
        image: portainer/portainer




现在在你的 docker-compose.yml 文件中复制上面几行。就这么简单！

正如我所说，你也可以使用 Composerize 网络服务将 docker run 命令转换成 Docker Compose 格式。

进入 https://www.composerize.com/，将 docker run 命令粘贴到框中，你就会立即得到 docker-compose.yml 文件！



将命令转换为 Docker Compose 文件后，到你保存 docker-compose.yml 文件的位置，运行以下命令来启动 Docker 应用：

$ docker-compose up


Composerize 是对 Docker 用户有用的工具之一。你现在可以安全地告别漫无边际的 Docker 命令了。

In my previous article, I created a framework for analyzing the directories and subdirectories of music files, using the groovy.File class, which extends and streamlines java.File and simplifies its use. In this article, I use the open source JAudiotagger library to analyze the tags of the music files in the music directory and subdirectories. Be sure to read the first article in this series if you intend to follow along.

              Hello everyone!🎉

Yesterday we launched open testing of the MVP of our timesharing platform. So far, the product is a database that stores parameters of participants such as name, time zone, profession, competencies, experience, fields of interest, learning needs, teaching abilities, and expert&#x27;s contacts for the public.
 
But the main version will become an all-in-one tool for time management with the following features: 
- Task management 
- Sale of meetings from personal schedules 
- Employee scheduling and time tracking -
 Dialogues and group chats 
- Reviews and ratings system 
- Internal hiring and recommendations
 - Project’s newsfeed 
- Transparent reward system

Now we really need your feedback, so guys, please check our MVP and feel free to write everything you think about the whole concept. Thank you very much in advance!

背景
读博士的这些年，我每天都在获取各式各样的知识。大到学术论文，小到快捷指令的配置教程，每份知识都可能在未来某个时刻派上用场。我根据自己的习惯和需求建立了一套工作流，用来记录以及内化各类知识。我的目标是形成自己的个人数据库，方便未来随时的调用。
知识有不同的特点，调用场景也各不相同。下面的表格展示了我对知识的理解以及相应的分类。在这篇文章里，我将针对每个类型，介绍了我记录（和内化）这些知识的经验，以及使用到的工具。


知识类型知识特点例子
学术研究格式固定，密度高，需要原文阅读学术论文，演讲
系统性知识内容多，密度低，自上而下结构大学课程，教科书，出版书籍
非系统性知识碎片化知识，自下而上结构CSDN，网络文章，教学/科普 视频
信息只需记录，不需整理做饭教学视频，服务器配置流程代码


1. 学术研究
首先要讨论的是学术研究类的知识，代表的例子就是学术论文。可能是因为阅读论文都需要花费巨大的精力而且经常会查阅，我通常会对阅读过论文有印象。即便不一定记得所有的细节，我还是很容易就能检索到，并重新阅读。
学术论文这一类知识有三个特点：

知识密度高：文章内容很浓缩，比较难再二次总结。未来通常需要再查阅论文的时候大概率还是得阅读原文。
格式固定：学术论文通常都会有 Abstract 来记录文章梗概。理工科的论文经常会有 Related Work, Methodology 和 Results 这些章节。第一次阅读难度较大，但理解以后再次阅读的难度不大，信息获取容易。
上下文重要：随意从论文中抽出来某一段文字或者配图，不一定很好理解。通常需要结合上下文才好理解。

由于查阅论文的大多需要阅读原文，所以我不会专门用笔记 app 给论文记笔记。我会把笔记直接记在论文 PDF 上。

                              <span>密码管理软件 LastPass 承认遭到黑客入侵

全球用户数超过 3300 万的密码管理软件公司 LastPass 表示，最近一名黑客在侵入其开发系统后窃取了部分源代码和一些专有信息。LastPass 将密码存储在“加密的保险箱”中，只有使用客户的主密码才能解密。LastPass 表示在这次网络攻击中主密码没有被泄露，用户不需要采取行动来保护他们的账户。


消息来源：Bleeping Computer



老王点评：理论上客户的主密码不会被泄露，因为 LastPass 也没有。但是其软件的源代码被泄露，或许一些潜在的缺陷就会被利用。总之，这个事情可能还需要进一步评估。




iPhone 的锁定模式会导致被识别

iPhone 的“锁定模式”禁用了一系列可用于入侵 iPhone 用户的功能。但是，如果用户打开锁定模式，他们将很容易被打上指纹和识别。据一位开发者说，他创建了一个概念验证网站，可以检测你是否启用了锁定模式。任何网站或在线广告都可以检测到一些常规功能是否缺失，比如加载自定义字体，这是锁定模式禁用的功能之一。

老王点评：这是安全和隐私之间的一个权衡，选择了极致安全却丢失了隐私。也许，会有更好的权衡方案。




微软称 80% 勒索软件攻击都是由于服务器错误配置导致

微软最近发布的《Cyber Signals》报告指出，勒索软件即服务（RaaS）日益猖獗，但是常规的软件设置就能应对，可以阻止大部分勒索软件攻击。此外，报告中还发现客户错误配置云服务、依赖不可靠的安全软件，以及通过默认宏设置的流量勒索软件，这导致微软制造了某种勒索软件攻击，即人为操作的勒索软件。


消息来源：Onmsft



老王点评：问题是，依靠人总是有各种疏漏，所以如何用软件或机制来保障这 80% 的情况才是最重要的。</span>

When people ask me what I love most about open source, my answer is simple: It&#x27;s the openness. With open source, the work that community developers and contributors do is in the public domain for all to see and benefit from. I couldn&#x27;t love that philosophy more.
How many people can say that about the fruits of their labor? How many, perhaps 50 years from now, can look back and say, &quot;Check out the code I wrote that day that hundreds/thousands/tens of thousands benefited from.&quot; I find that infinitely more exciting than working on software that&#x27;s hidden from most of the world.
I&#x27;m fortunate that my job puts me in the middle of an interesting area where open …</span>

                              <span>概述
平时开发遇到一些问题，比如
怎么确认引入的第三方so是否适配32/64位
怎么知道第三方库申请了那些权限
每次开发引入的图片怎么一键压缩并自动引入项目内，并且每次使用不会重复压缩
每次写项目都会创建shape,而这个shape很可能同事写过我不知道又写了一遍，很可能一个项目中存在很多重复的shape，只是命名不同，该如何找到这些重复的shape
针对上方问题，再结合gradle插件开发了一个插件工具，可以解决这些问题，在这里分享出来，希望可以帮助到更多人
使用
引入库
在根目录的build.gradle 引入
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath &quot;com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.2.2&quot;
        //引入这个库
        classpath &quot;io.githunb.renxh4:compress_png:0.0.5&quot;
    }
}

在app的build.gradle引入插件
apply plugin: &#x27;com.ren.xh.plugin&#x27;

xh{
    tinifyId &#x3D; &quot;wQdHz6dkJhtSCt0sHwCmvQh5lpSMcyL1&quot;
}

引入插件后，需要配置tinifyId,因为这里使用的是https://tinify.cn/ 进行压缩的图片，需要到这个网站申请一个开发者id，仅需要俩步就可以轻松申请

使用库
检测so适配
命令行执行命令 ./gradlew checkso

./gradlew checkso

最近，我正在研究使用 Obsidian，想看看大名鼎鼎的「卡片盒笔记法」是否真的能解决我读书过目就忘的困扰。不过困扰还不知道能不能解决，我就发现了新的问题。
Obsidian 有许多优点，其中一个就是自带社区主题库，用户可以随意更换样式，不再天天看千篇一律的外观。然而，尽管社区主题库里有很多主题样式，说实话，没有一个能百分之百令我满意的。
比如「Things」这个主题，我很喜欢它的简洁风格，但是它每一级的标题颜色却似乎并不遵循某种规律，甚至莫名其妙地在二级标题下多出了一条下划线，这一点让完美主义的我无比介意。

我明白，主题风格毕竟只是制作者的个人喜好，肯定是做不到让所有使用者都百分之百满意的。那么，有没有什么办法，可以让我自己来自定义主题呢？
答案是有的，Obsidian 设置中的「CSS 代码片段」这个功能就是为用户对外观进行自定义而准备的。

HTML 与 CSS
Obsidian 的外观本质上是由 CSS 代码所决定的。
我们可以打开 Obsidian 的窗口，按下 Ctrl + Shift + I，即可开启开发者工具（Developer Tools），这个操作和在浏览器中开启开发者工具是一样的，展示出来的也同样是 HTML 文档。

HTML，全称「HyperText Markup Language」，又称为「超文本标记语言」，它的作用就是告诉浏览器这个网页该怎么渲染，比如这段文字是一级标题，这一段文字是正文，而这一段文字是链接，可以跳转别的网页。
听起来和 Obsidian 所使用的 Markdown 很像。没错，M…</span>

相信许多普通用户都在用着M-ATX规格的主板，这也是颇具性价比的装机方案之一，毕竟追求极致性能也是需要口袋中有充足的氪金。但很有意思的是，虽然我们用着M-ATX规格主板，但机箱却多为ATX塔式。就如同我一样，给自己整了一个大机箱，装着一块M-ATX主板，美其名曰多出的空间散热更好。但说实话，机箱的散热效率还是要看风道设计，并不是箱子越大越好。

目前市面上M-ATX规格机箱并没有太多的新意，不是全侧透就是双侧透，有些外观甚至只差一个厂家LOGO，可选的机箱造型并不多，说是属于“缩小版”的ATX塔式机箱也不为过。对于我这种想减少光渲染又不想完全损失光影的玩家来说，确实很难抉择。

不过幸好最近华硕新推出了一款M-ATX规格机箱--华硕ASUS PRIME AP201冰立方机箱。初看商品介绍页面并没太大感觉，但翻了几篇买家秀后，发现设计感贼给力。接下来就聊聊我的换机体验，希望给各位小伙伴带来一些参考。

当我将机箱换成华硕ASUS PRIME AP201冰立方机箱（以下简称华硕AP201冰立方机箱）并开机后，原先十分耀眼的光污染瞬间变得柔和起来。

关掉室内灯光后，整个华硕AP201冰立方机箱的光效就如同穿上了一套薄纱，内部的硬件会随着RGB灯效若隐若现，附加了一种神秘，确实有一种立方体的既视感。

从正上方看去，水冷风扇光影透过散热孔散出，被分割成具有像素风的格纹，经过切割的光影既复古又有奇幻的感觉。

而在光线充足的环境中，光影又并不会透出多少，朦胧中充满了低调，颇具内涵。

实际上华硕AP201冰立方机箱的内部自成天地，光影被拉得很足，离光污染全开之间也只差一个机盖开启动作。

外观小巧，却“大”有来头

华硕AP201冰立方机箱的外包装比较低调简洁，产品的特色描述并不算多，注明了支持360mm水冷，338mm显卡和ATX电源。

前言
很高兴遇见你~
在本系列的上一篇文章中，我们介绍了 Flutter 特点以及一些常用的 Widget：MaterialApp，Scaffold，AppBar，Center，Container，Text。还没有看过上一篇文章的朋友，建议先去阅读 Flutter 系列（三）：Flutter 特点及常用 Widget 介绍。接下来我们继续对 Flutter Widget 进行学习
下面我会通过：效果展示 -&gt; Widget 讲解 -&gt; 代码实现的方式对 Widget 进行介绍，最后在通过 Widget 组合编写一个综合的案例
一、Flutter Widget 之 Image
Image 是 Flutter 给我们提供显示图片的 Widget
先看一眼使用 Image 实现的效果
1.1、Image 效果展示

刘亦菲的圆形图片😄，美爆了。言归正传，大家可以先想一下怎么去实现？
1.2、Image 介绍
Image 组件有很多构造方法，这里给大家讲两个常用的：
1、Image.network ：加载远程图片
2、Image.asset ：加载本地图片
上面这两个属于 Image 的命名构造方法，对命名构造方法还不熟悉的赶紧先去看一下我的另一篇文章传送门
1.2.1、Image.network 加载远程图片
import &#x27;package:flutter/material.dart&#x27;;

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(

起因于自己想研究一下 game-engine，但是主流的 ue 什么的太过庞大了（庞大也是必然），于是想到了比较亲切的 Flutter Engine（其实也蛮复杂的），于是想梳理一下其 启动 和 绘制 的大概流程。
开始
注意， Flutter Engine 也相当庞大，由于精力有限，只能梳理部分内容。
Flutter Engine - Github
在开始之前，列举一下相关的代码文件夹
fml （基础功能的封装，比如基于task 的线程，log，时钟，路径，哈希等 很底层很硬核的东西）
shell/common （直接引用 shell.h 注释的一句话：Perhaps the single most important class in the Flutter engine repository.）
shell/runtime （不同平台对 embedder engine 具体实现）
impeller （图形后端，也就是roadmap 提到的在重构东西，你会发现它的 commit 时间最近，还带了好多个⚠️）
启动
Flutter 有几个线程？ 首先排除单线程，再排除经常看到的 5 线程模型（其实没啥问题）。 为什么皮这一下，因为实际情况可能比你想象的复杂的多，举两个例子：你在 Dart 开了一个 Compute Isolate，并且愉快的使用 fronted-server 提供的 hot-reload，这下情况就复杂了吧。
言归正传，我们从官方的 examples/vulkan_glfw 例子进行分析（我接触的时候当时只有一个 glfw-opengl 的例子，令人感概）
如何启动 Fluuter Engine ？
#include &quot;embedder.h&quot; // Flutter&#x27;s Embedder ABI.

Compose中我们应该怎么使用地图呢？像之前我们在xml里面创建MapView，都是在Activity里面，管理MapView生命周期，和其他的监听器，Compose里面怎么搞？
下面我们以高德地图为例，在Compose中创建地图MapView，然后用AndroidView添加MapView，像下面这样：
AndroidView(modifier &#x3D; Modifier, factory &#x3D; { MapView }){...}

我们看到，高德地图官网，给开发者的建议：

所以我们需要做什么，大家晓得了哇，生命周期回调我们要拿到，那我们应该怎么搞？
我们需要用到LocalLifecycleOwner.current.lifecycle去添加生命周期观察者，
LifecycleObserver是一个接口，它长下面这样：

我们看注释可以看到，我们可以使用DefaultLifecycleObserver或者LifecycleEventObserver，
DefaultLifecycleObserver里面它提供了所有的生命周期事件的回调，并且默认情况下都是什么都不做。
LifecycleEventObserver，它提供了一个onStateChanged方法，所有的生命周期事件都可以在这里被接受到。
所以，我们这里就使用LifecycleEventObserver，为啥懂的都懂。
我们有了2个需要初始化的东西，一个是MapView，一个是添加生命周期观察者。
为什么要添加生命周期观察者，看了上面的官方文档应该知道是为什么，是需要管理地图的生命周期，下面我们来讲讲如何做，该怎么做。
初始化MapView并添加到AndroidView里面：

前言
之前的文章对build.dart 如何生成的做了一个简单分析，现在build.yaml配置参数已经通过build.dart 引入到build体系中了，接下来就该根据参数执行builder了；
在第一篇文章中简单概括了build.dart 的执行流程，最终是由build.dart 会执行BuildRunner去执行所有builder并返回结果；那么现在就该看下BuildRunner到底做了什么；
BuildRunner

BuilderOption
首先是配置参数部分，在这里首先构建了BuilderOption，其所需的参数中除了一些bool开关之类的简单配置外，就只有三个部分：packageGraph、overidBuildConfig、resolvers；
其中packageGraph在前面文章中经常见了，根据pubspec.yaml而生成的依赖有向图；
overidBuildConfig也是打过招呼的部分，是根据build.yaml生成的BuildConfigMap；
resolvers这个还没介绍过，看注释，其作用是生成BuildStep，在这里先跳过，这个BuildStep里面又搞出好几个新东西，后面一起看；

BuilderOption 的创建是通过其create方法，其方法中会先创建TargetGraph，之后给resolver分配个兜底值（AnalyzerResolvers），最后组合起来；
而这个TargetGraph跟PackageGraph的区别是，PackageGraph 是根据pubspec.yaml生成的；而TargetGraph是在PackageGraph基础上，使用overridBuildConfig覆盖之后生成的；这也…</span>

很高兴遇见你~
最近我负责的 LiveChat 客服聊天系统到了自研阶段，类似做一个腾讯 IM 通信 SDK。和后台讨论后，确定数据传输方式使用 Protobuf，简单的介绍下自己的一个使用心得
一、Protobuf 介绍
Protobuf 全称：Protocol Buffers，是 Google 推出的一种与平台无关、语言无关、可扩展的轻便高效的序列化数据存储格式，类似于我们常用的 xml 和 json。
问题：既然有了 xml 和 json，Google 为啥还要推出 Protobuf 呢？
存在是有原因的，Protobuf 用两个字总结：小，快。用 Protobuf 序列化后的大小是 json 的十分之一，是 xml 格式的二十分之一，而且性能是他们的 5～100 倍。
通常情况下，我们使用 xml 或者 json 进行数据通信是没什么问题的，但是在高性能和大数据通信的情况下，如果有办法压缩数据量，提高传输效率，显然会给用户带来更快更流畅的体验，因此做 LiveChat 自研，Protobuf 成为我们进行数据传输的第一选择。

前言
MVI并非新兴事物，在2020年时亦曾有通过撰写一篇文章与诸位读者探讨一二的念头。
当时项目采用MVP分层设计，组员的代码风格差异也较大，代码中类职责赋予与封装风格各成一套，随着业务急速膨胀，代码越发混乱。试图用 MVI架构 + 单向流 形成 掣肘 带来一致风格。
但这种做法不够以人为本，最终采用 &quot;在MVP的基础上进行了适当改造+设计约定的方式&quot; 解决了问题，并未将MVI投入到商业项目中，于是 放弃了纸上谈兵。
在半年前终于有机会在商业项目中进行实践，同诸位谈一谈使用后的 个人感悟 ，并藉此讲透MVI等架构。
所有内容将按照以下要点展开：
从架构的理念出发 -- 简单列明各种 MVX 的理念 ， MVX：指代 MVC、MVP、MVVM、MVI
拥抱复杂的同时实现简化 -- 通过对比理解单向数据流动所解决的痛点、设计Intent的原因等问题
单一可信数据源，不可僵化信奉
要想优雅，需要工具 -- 借助声明式、响应式编程工具，构建流，屏蔽命令式编程中的细节，同样是聚焦和简化
状态和事件分家，绝不是吃饱了撑的 -- 为什么要裂变出状态和事件，如何界定
内容会很长，我会酌情再写一些 解 ，结合实例和代码演示内容。
两个项目的基本情况
相比于之前的巨型项目，这两个项目的业务量均不大，一个是基于蓝牙和局域网的操控类APP，下午简称APP-A，一个是内部使用的工具，分析公司各个产品的日志，简称APP-B。
虽然他们的业务深度要比一般的APP要深，但在 本质上一致 ，毕竟同类型业务量再多也仅仅是重复运用一套模式 ，并不影响本质。
和诸多项目的本质一致，均符合如下图所示的逻辑分层，并在人机交互过程中执行业务逻辑：

Whether attending conferences or reading blogs, I often hear several misconceptions about sudo. Most of these misconceptions focus on security, flexibility, and central management. In this article, I will debunk some of these myths.
Many misconceptions likely arise because users know only the basic functionality of sudo. The sudoers file, by default, has only two rules: The root user, and members of the administrative wheel group, can do practically anything using sudo. There are barely any limits, and optional features are not enabled at all. Even this setup is better than sharing the root password, as you can usually follow who did what on your systems using the logs. However, learnin…</span>

Apache ShardingSphere 5.0.0-Beta version with DistSQL made the project even more beloved by developers and ops teams for its advantages, such as dynamic effects, no restart, and elegant syntax close to standard SQL. With upgrades to 5.0.0 and 5.1.0, the ShardingSphere community has once again added abundant syntax to DistSQL, bringing more practical features.
In this article, the community co-authors will share the latest functions of DistSQL from the perspective of cluster governance.
ShardingSphere clusters
In a typical cluster composed of ShardingSphere-Proxy, there are multiple compute nodes and storage nodes, as shown in the figure below.

Notion、Obsidian、Logseq、Roam Research、Evernote、flomo、为知、飞书、语雀……知识管理/笔记软件越来越多，我总在不同应用间徘徊。直到有次忽然醒悟，知识管理软件不是管理知识，而是管理笔记。笔记里的知识并不属于你，只有经过消化、应用，才会成为自己的知识。
这么简单的事，我之前却一直没看透，总是把笔记与知识理解划上了等号。当要用到曾摘录的笔记时，就在各类知识管理软件里翻找，折腾一番才找到需要的笔记，有时甚至出现「自己不清楚放在哪里，也不清楚是否有」的情况。记笔记花了一个小时，下次寻找与重新消化又花了一个小时，原本为效率而生的知识管理软件变成了浪费时间的杀手。
另一方面，我们在用知识管理软件的美观界面和强大功能的同时，也被这些软件所限制，无法完全按自己的想法输出笔记。比如，你长了一双翅膀，Markdown 文本是自由的天地，而进入 Notion 则被隔成一个个小房间，你在房间里待着很舒服，可一旦想去其他房间，就必须脱离 block，不比 Markdown 可以自由飞翔。

突破迷思后，我基于 VuePress 和 vuepress-theme-hope 建立了 LearnData 项目，把知识笔记、生活记录、博客和任何觉得有价值的记录转成 Markdown 文本，然后推送到 GitHub 生成 Pages 静态页面，同步到国内云服务器形成 LearnData - 开源学习笔记。

LearnData 的笔记/文章编辑均使用 Markdown，输出不再受到应用的局限。同时，LearnData …</span>

2022年是新能源车国补的收尾年，随着销量提升，纯电新能源车品牌不断增多，可选性逐渐增大，价格也不断攀升。 

新能源车最完美的使用环境就是有家用充电桩的日常通勤，享受每公里0.05元以下的电费成本，每天到家就能补足电量，即不产生里程焦虑，也极大程度降低出行成本。
早年新能源车标配充电桩，如今随着价格的提高，充电桩成为了重点阉割项目，不说早早就卖8000的特斯拉，今年的小鹏、问界、沃尔沃都不再赠送充电桩，未来越来越多的厂商会加入这一行列。
7KW充电桩或成为未来主流
虽然我个人认为家用申请380V电表，安装21KW充电桩是拓展性最好的极优解，但目前随着环境的改变，未来大部分国人的家充桩都会是220V 7KW的家用桩。 

首先是电网的审批层面，上海地区的国家电网已经于今年停止了380V充电桩电表的新装报批，目前国网只为新能源车主开放220V电表，最大功率7KW的申请渠道。
这是因新能源车增多而出现的必然趋势，国内未来势必会逐渐取消380V电表用于充电。 

第二是对于交流充电而言，家用充电桩是带有保护装置的连接件，充电过程发生于车载充电机，最快交流充电速度由充电机决定，目前国内在售交流充电速率最高的是16KW，搭载在Model S与Model X两台百万级豪车上，一般大众款新能源车，没有这样的高功率电机。 

理想、威马、蔚来、比亚迪、埃安、荣威等主流的新能源车品牌的核心车型，基本都是内置7KW充电机，不支持11KW三相电来交流充电，所以对于很多车主，7KW充电桩已经是顶配了。
最后是7KW交流充电的表现，以谷时点8小时计算，可以为车辆补充56度电，目前市面大部分家用中小型纯电新能源车的能耗在每度电6~7公里，折算一夜谷时可以补电300~350公里，完全可以狠狠开上一整天。
所以，因为政策、热销车辆和7KW充电桩家充综合体验来看，220V 7KW的家充桩或将是未来家庭…</span>

这个需求应该也很少遇到，我就简单记录下，不展开写了。在使用 Material 3 主题的 NavigationBar 时，想在原有效果上，加一条底部横线，是这样的。

正文
在查看文档后，发现 NavigationBar 不支持底部横线效果，但可以设置一个 indicatorShape：
ThemeData defaultThemes({bool useLightMode &#x3D; true}) {
  return ThemeData(
    colorSchemeSeed: colorOptions[0],
    useMaterial3: true,
    brightness: useLightMode ? Brightness.light : Brightness.dark,
    navigationBarTheme: const NavigationBarThemeData().copyWith(
      height: navigationBarHeight,
      labelTextStyle: MaterialStateProperty.all(
        const TextStyle(fontSize: navigationBarLabelSize),
      ),
      // Add line under the navigationBar as indicator.
      indicatorShape: const RoundedRectangleBorder2(
        height: navigationBarHeight,
        lineColor: navigationBarLineColor,
      ),
    ),
  );
}

默认的这个蓝色圆角矩形指示器，就是系统提供的 RoundedRectangleBorder 类，所以我将它的源码拷贝出来一份，不必改变原有逻辑，只需要在 paint 方法内绘制我们需要的横线即可：
case BorderStyle.none:
  if (null !&#x3D; lineColor &amp;&amp; null !&#x3D; height) {
    const double stroke &#x3D; 4;
    const double padding &#x3D; 4;
    final Paint paint &#x3D; Paint()
      ..color &#x3D; lineColor!
      ..strokeWidth &#x3D; stroke;
     
    // 要注意 icon + label 是居中显示的.
    // [0, 0] 是在蓝色背景的上边，而不是 navigation bar 的上边.
    // 通过源码可知 [蓝色矩形] 高度：rect.height.
    // [label] 大小是我们通过 labelTextStyle 设置的.
    // 边距 [padding] 默认是 4dp.
    // [height]是我们设置的 navigation bar 高度。
    canvas.drawLine(
        Offset(
          0,
          (rect.height + navigationBarLabelSize + 2 * padding + height!) * 0.5,
        ),
        Offset(
          rect.width,
          (rect.height + navigationBarLabelSize + 2 * padding + height!) * 0.5,
        ),
        paint);
  }

代码就这点，本节完。</span>

本节是在上篇 有固定 header 的底部滑动页效果  功能上的一个小扩展，即当滑动距离超过一半则自动滚至顶部，反之回到底部，来看下效果：
正文
思路也很简单，首先我要知道当前滚动的距离或其占比，DraggableScrollableController 提供了这个能力：
void _draggableScrollListener() {
  // [_currStale] 记录下当前的占比
  // [_controller.size] 即占比, 范围[minChildSize,maxChildSize]
  // [_controller.pixels] 即距离
  if (_currStale !&#x3D; _controller.size) {
    _currStale &#x3D; _controller.size;
  }
  debugPrint(&#x27;[listener] size: ${_controller.size}&#x27;
      &#x27;, pixels : ${_controller.pixels}&#x27;);
}

其次要知道用户何时停止了滚动，我们可以使用 NotificationListener 来监听 DraggableScrollableSheet 的滚动状态：
NotificationListener(
  onNotification: (ScrollNotification notification) {
    ...
    return false;
  },
child: DraggableScrollableSheet(...),

之后在用户停止滚动的时候，我们判断当前距离，并根据结果让 DraggableScrollableSheet 自动滚动到顶部或底部。

前言
Gradle自定义Task看起来非常简单，通过tasks.register等API就可以轻松实现。但实际上为了写出高效的，可缓存的，不拖慢编译速度的task，还需要了解更多知识。
本文主要包括以下内容:
定义Task
查找Task
配置Task
将参数传递给Task构造函数
Task添加依赖
Task排序
Task添加说明
跳过Task
Task支持增量编译
Finalizer Task
定义Task
如上所说，自定义Task一般可以通过register API实现
tasks.register(&quot;hello&quot;) {
    doLast {
        println(&quot;hello&quot;)
    }
}

tasks.register(&quot;copy&quot;) {
    from(file(&quot;srcDir&quot;))
    into(buildDir)
}

如果是kotlin或者kts中，也可以通过代理来实现
val hello by tasks.registering {
    doLast {
        println(&quot;hello&quot;)
    }
}

val copy by tasks.registering(Copy::class) {
    from(file(&quot;srcDir&quot;))
    into(buildDir)
}

register与create的区别
除了上面介绍的register，其实create也可以用于创建Task，那么它们有什么区别呢?
通过register创建时，只有在这个task被需要时才会真正创建与配置该Task(被需要是指在本次构建中需要执行该Task)
通过create创建时，则会立即创建与配置该Task
总得来说，通过register…</span>

cpu 信息作为性能监控四大常用指标 (cpu、内存、网络、磁盘)之一，对衡量设备性能，分析、确认一些线上性能问题有着较为重要的作用。
这里举个应用场景： 在得物APM平台的页面慢启动监控中，样本存在慢启动对应的函数火焰图中并未提取到明显耗时函数的情况，但通过分析其启动阶段的CPU使用率信息、CPU频率信息，发现其系统CPU使用率极高，而进程、主线程CPU使用率并不高，启动阶段主要的资源使用是cpu 及 io, 因为未存在IO阻塞函数，因此可以将此类问题归因为系统CPU负载高、主线程未分配到充足时间片来执行启动阶段的函数，因此导致页面慢启动问题。


计算系统CPU使用率
/proc 及 /sys 伪文件系统
在介绍具体实现时，需要先了解 一些关键的伪文件系统(pseudo filesystems)，如procfs、sysfs。它们以文件的方式为内核与进程提供通信的接口，但其信息只存在于内存当中，而不占用外存空间。 用户和程序可以通过 读取 这些文件下的 目录及子目录下的相关文件得到系统提供的一些资源信息,我们所知道的 ps、top、free等程序底层实现也是通过读取这些fs来获取系统的相关信息的。
举个例子，比如在/proc/cpuinfo 文件提供了每个cpu的相关信息(型号、缓存大小等)。

前言
在flutter项目中，页面内直接调用setState方法会使得页面重新执行build方法，导致内部组件被全量刷新，造成不必要的性能消耗。出于性能和用户体验方面的考虑我们经常会使用局部刷新代替全量刷新进行页面更新的操作。
包括Provider、ValueNotifier和StatefulBuilder等在内的技术方案，都能够帮助我们实现Flutter局部刷新的需求。有兴趣了解StatefulBuilder局部刷新方法可以点击《Flutter StatefulBuilder 实现局部刷新》进行查看，本文记录的是通过StreamBuilder来实现局部刷新的方法。
StreamBuilder 简介
StreamBuilder组件的源代码如下，其中包含了四个参数:
 const StreamBuilder({
     Key? key,
     this.initialData,
     Stream? stream,
     required this.builder,
   }) : assert(builder !&#x3D; null),
        super(key: key, stream: stream);

key : 组件的键值
initialData : 初始值数据，用于确保第一帧有可用数据显示，否则将使用 null 值构建第一帧
stream : 用于监听自己创建的数据流
builder : 必传参数，返回一个小部件用于页面构建
其中builder 包含了两个参数，一个页面的context，另一个是当前快照信息：

前言
在上一篇文章中，我们说到打算使用 compose 实现一个计算器 APP，最开始打算做一个经典的 LCD 基础计算器，后来觉得好像没啥特色，最终决定还是改成仿微软计算器。
不过，微软计算器的功能太多了，仿制的工程量不小，所以我打算只仿我认为最核心的两个模式：标准模式和程序员模式。
另外，这篇文章只说 UI 实现，具体的运算逻辑可以自行查看源码。
功能特性
是否支持
功能




✔
基础四则运算（标准、程序员）


✔
无限输入（标准）


✔
% , 1/x , x² , √x 扩展运算（标准）


✔
运算过程历史记录（标准）


✔
二进制、八进制、十进制、十六进制随意切换并实时换算（程序员）


✔
位运算：左移、右移（程序员）


✔
逻辑运算：AND、OR、NOT、XOR（程序员）


✔
无限连续计算（标准、程序员）


✔
支持悬浮窗计算器，可调整位置、大小、透明度（标准）


✔
符合人体握持习惯的横屏键盘


✔
旋转手机自动切换标准和程序员键盘


✔
深色模式


✔
酷炫的数字动效与振动反馈



注意：
标准模式使用 BigDecimal 计算，所以理论支持无限位数数字计算
程序员模式因为涉及到二进制计算，所以采用 64 位储存大小，故不支持无限位数计算
程序员模式不支持带小数运算，如果运算结果有小数，则会直接抛弃小数部分

前言
最近有一个小需求：图表支持局部显示，如下底部的区域选择器支持
左右拖动调节中间区域
拖拽中间区域，可以进行移动
图表数据根据中间区域的占比进行显示部分数据

这样当图表的数据量过大，不宜全部展示时，可选择的局部展示就是个不错的解决方案。由于一般的图表库没有提供该功能，这里自己通过绘制来实现以下，操作效果如下所示：

1. 使用 chart_range_selector
目前这个范围选择器已经发布到 pub 上了，名字是 chart_range_selector。大家可以通过依赖进行添加
dependencies:
  chart_range_selector: ^1.0.0

这个库本身是作为独立 UI 组件存在的，在拖拽过程中改变区域范围时，会触发回调。使用者可以通过监听来获取当前区域的范围。这里的区域起止是以分率的形式给出的，也就是最左侧是 0 最右侧是 1 。如下的区域范围是 0.26 ~ 0.72 。

ChartRangeSelector(
  height: 30,
  initStart: 0.4,
  initEnd: 0.6,
  onChartRangeChange: _onChartRangeChange,
),

void _onChartRangeChange(double start, double end) {
  print(&quot;start:$start, end:$end&quot;);
}

封装的组件名为： ChartRangeSelector ，提供了如下的一些配置参数：

initStart

范围启始值 0~1


initEnd

前言
测算函数/方法执行耗时，对于每一位开发同学来说，似乎都是一道绕不过的坎，几乎都曾经历过。也许你会使用下面这种方式：

这种方法高效、成本低。但如果发散到测算成千上百个函数/方法执行耗时的时候，显然这并不是一个好办法。那么在iOS开发中有什么好方案吗？经过一番研究探索，我们实现了一套基于汇编hook objc_msgSend进行方法耗时计算的方案，开源地址见 -&gt;https://github.com/HuolalaTech/hll-wp-guldan-ios&lt;-。 接下来，带大家走进本文。
在开始之前，我们做以下约定：
本文中的 OC 指代 Objective C，ARM 指代 ARM 64。
背景
货拉拉移动端各条业务线产品，在每一次版本发布前，都会经过严格的各项性能测试，其中有一项启动性能测试，背后使用的是淘宝开源的tidevice工具（本质与libimobiledevice类似）。但这种性能测试处于流水线中末端，也有一定的分析成本。我们总结痛点如下：
定位难，责任划分不清；
方法耗时问题比较难以定位，不能定位到业务所在的位置，也就容易出现归属和责任不清的尴尬境遇；
动作滞后，影响发布；
启动性能测试处于流水线中末端，比较滞后，如果发现修复影响面比较大的问题，可能会影响版本发布；
工时长，不可持续；
Xcode Instruments虽然可以在开发时使用，但使用时间比较长，分析结果难以持续，近似属于消费完便丢掉的状态。
我们的目标是：
低成本：接入方低成本接入；
无侵入：不侵入业务；
高性能：性能足够高；
可视化：分析结果可视化；
探索
站在巨人的肩膀上
在梳理完需求之后，值得做的第一件事便是翻阅前人在该领域的探索和实践过程中所积累下来的资料。站在巨人…</span>

作为一个法学生，我的日常生活主要围绕在上课、论文、实习以及我杂七杂八的爱好上。今天在这里跟大家聊一聊我是如果进行任务管理的。
我的任务管理系统
软件的选择
从2017年接触滴答清单以来，滴答清单变得功能越来越丰富。熟悉这款软件的人都知道，如今的滴答清单已经不单单是一款Todo  List软件了，而是一款融合日历、笔记、清单、习惯打卡、番茄钟的“综合性”软件。
我相信大多数的“少数派”们都是“Less is more”的坚实簇拥者，看到现在的滴答清单一定也会和我一样不自觉的想起国产的印象笔记，觉得这是一款什么都做却又什么都做不好的软件。因此从2017年接触这款软件后，我很快又转向了Things、Omnifocus、Todoist、Anydo、2Do、微软Todo、Reminder……
不夸张的说，从2016年接触GTD概念后的我，基本用过市面上各式各样的GTD软件，但是时隔多年，2016年的我刚刚进入大学，如今的我研究生也已经快要毕业了，在经历过不同环境下各种工作流的转换，兜兜转转我还是回到了滴答清单，原因无他，唯性价比高、满足我的需求、稳定矣。
化繁为简
虽然现在的滴答清单功能复杂，但好在这款软件还是给我们“Less is more”的选择，即仅选择我们用得到的功能，隐藏那些我们用不到的功能
滴答清单的功能模块隐藏
就我个人而言，我把滴答清单仅作为我的Todo List和日历，因此也就只选择了这两个功能模块。除了能够隐藏部分“功能”，在滴答清单里，还能够做到隐藏“视图”、“标签”等，将“Less is more”的观点贯彻到底，对于显示什么，不显示什么给了我们非常大的自主权。

下面我就来讲讲我具体是怎样使用滴答清单来处理我的日常生活的。

                              <span>越来越受欢迎的白板工具
最近几年市面上出现了很多白板工具应用，白板顾名思义就是在手机、平板、或者电脑上模拟现实生活中白板的应用。
白板应用从产品设计的角度来讲及其简单，因为白板应用的的概念模型足够简单——就是一张白纸、或者办公室放着的一块白板。
如果仅从概念模型上来看，白板应用似乎没啥可做的，你只需要写一个白板，然后做一个手写功能就可以了。
那么为什么市面上还是有那么多的白板应用呢？以及决定一款白板应用好不好用，我们是不是有什么样的评价标准呢？
对于这个问题，我想说的是，在保证使用体验的前提下，工具产品本身是没有好坏之分的，评判一款工具产品好不好其实没有意义，工具产品只能基于你的使用场景，评判适不适合。所以基于这个逻辑，我使用一个框架对市面上的白板应用进行了一个简单的分类。

 
在纵向，我根据使用场景来进行划分，就是你使用白板更多的时候是个人使用，还是需要和别人协作？
在横坐标上，我使用白板本身的功能性来进行划分，目前市面上的白板应用在功能性层面主要分为两类，第一类主打真实书写体验，无限书写区域，完全书写自由度，第二类则主打提供模块化的组件，弱化书写体验，强化沟通模版的白板应用。
从这种分类方式可以发现，其实个人的更偏向于自由度高的，而协作的更偏向于模块化的，为什么呢？
因为这和实际的工作场景是匹配的，个人使用白板，无论怎么发散书写，书写的信息的上下文都在个人脑中。但如果是协作场景的话，沟通的效率就变得至关重要，所以一些通用的，模块化的，标准化的沟通方法可以让所有对一个事情的认知都对齐，这种方法本质上是弱化了个人化的表达方式，用更标准的沟通方式来提升沟通效率。
也许以上分类方法并不是一定合理，但就目前我自己用起来是OK的。
在聊具体的白板应用之前我想，先聊一个问题。
为什么白板这么好用？

你或多或少还能想起一些公号大V，还有以前在朋友圈刷屏的文章，那些高光时刻像浮雕一样刻在脑海，好像见证着这个平台的兴衰浮沉。
今天不考古，也不讲宏大叙事，想从个人的视角，跟你分享下我与公众号的一些故事。

我第一次知道公众号是2013年，那是大一下学期，我也刚注册微信。
彼时微博正兴，因在校园杂志上看到「糗事大百科」博主赵诚玩微博年入千万，颠覆认知，第一次看到上学-工作之外的道路。
我能不能呢？不知道，但想试试。
寒假买了第一台笔记本电脑，从此没日没夜沉浸在微博里，研究怎么涨粉、互推、发段子。
做搞笑内容半年时间，小有成就，到了5万多粉丝（没买粉），偶有广告投放赚点零花钱，我对微博的发展充满信心。
注册微信后了解到公众号，那会儿我对它是不屑一顾的，长内容、排版难看、一天就发一条、没互动，怎么看都没出路。而微博不一样，信息流、用户停留时间长、话题多、互动丰富、140字段子&amp;新闻、搞笑动图，人们更喜欢，这才是媒介发展的下一个方向。
公众号就像上个时代的博客，现在无非迁移到移动端，换汤不换药。
谁愿意拿着手机看长文呢？
2014年，我给学校一家饰品玩具店出营销主意，老板问我要不要做公众号，我坚决说不要做，耽误精力、不能实时传达，还得引导关注，太麻烦，不如加微信好友送小礼品，然后朋友圈发优惠活动。人们不看公众号，但肯定刷朋友圈，触达率更高（没想到那会儿就有私域流量的理念了）。
转变是在大二下学期，微博起色不大，发送频率高又耽误学习，而且一直发搞笑段子觉得没意义，就把号卖了。
于此同时，公众号很多优质内容开始出现，好多大V也倾向长文、深度观点输出，即便是搞笑段子，质量也比微博高一个层次。自己开始沉迷每日阅读公号，朋友圈也经常有刷屏文章，同学讨论的也是XX文章的观点，仿佛突…</span>

                              <span>「第二份简历」
首先解释一下这个「第二份」是什么意思。我通常喜欢把在大四校招时使用的简历称作「第一份简历」，因为那是你踏入社会的第一步，是你第一次将自己的经历通过简历来展示。往后跳槽、换工作使用的简历都可以称作「第二份」，它代表着你已经是一个成熟的社会人，有足够的社会、工作经验。
那么就让我们先回看一下「第一份简历」我们都会写一些什么。我们在写校招简历的时候，通常会涉及到的内容为以下几点。

专业课分数 / 绩点
奖惩情况
兼职情况
在校期间参与的项目（可以是学校的实验，也可以是兼职参与的项目）
在校期间所任职务

这五点足够展现你在大学四年的能力，让校招企业充分了解你。因为能够参与校招的企业，都知道你不会有正式的工作经历，自然也没参与过社会上的工作项目。企业人事对参与校招的学生大多抱着「该生是否有培养空间」的态度来面对。因此在写校招简历的时候上面五点只需要充分体现你的潜力就足以吸引到大部分校招企业。
来到「第二份简历」，这个时候你面对的 HR ，不再会把你当作初出茅庐的应届毕业生，而是一个有着社会工作经验的求职者。HR 对求职者的要求也非常简单明了，即「你是否能为公司创造价值」。这个「价值」可以是短期内的，也可以是长远角度的，具体看 HR 怎么定位你的职位。但是有一点是不变的，那就是上面提到的，你不再是学生，你只是「求职者」。
如何写「第二份简历」
「第二份简历」相比「第一份简历」，会有不少内容上的变化。首先是不再着重于在校情况的描写，而是着墨于当前或者上段工作经历的一个梳理与细致归纳。不要简单概括，而是要将内容详细写出来。同时，在现公司或者前公司所做的项目，也要有个清晰的描写。

                              <span>最近我们发布了一款全新的笔记产品——Neatfiy。（https://neatifyapp.com/）
正如其名，Neat（整洁）ify（化），Neatify 的初衷是编辑整洁清晰的结构化笔记，比起很快速的随手记备忘录，它适用于知识的管理、周期性的写作总结...之类的场景。
如左图
在大约去年年底的时候，我们立下了一个 Flag——我们要将专注笔记进行一次重构。 Neatify 就是我们拿出来的结果。下面不简单地聊一下，我们在这个路上的一些思考，以及集中回答一些朋友提出的疑问：

很多人对于 Neatify 的第一个疑问，就是为什么我们团队要出两款很相似的两款产品？

专注笔记，是我们第一款推出的笔记软件。也是我们团队首次接触「笔记」软件的开始，虽然我们自己也很喜欢专注笔记，它有很多很有用的功能及体验，比如结构化的目录、清晰的标注阅读体验。
但确实我们是第一次做笔记软件，前期很多没想清楚的地方，因此做了很多没什么用、甚至很负面的一些设计。这些是一些很沉重的历史包袱。如果我们还背着沉重的历史包袱，我们在优化的过程中就显得被束缚住了。
很显然的是，我们在这三年多的积累里，最重要的不是我们写过了什么代码，而是积累了很多很多的经验。所以我们这次，希望是抛开一切已有的东西，去构思一款自己心目中最理想的笔记产品应该是怎样的。这就是 Neatify。
在 Neatfiy 上面，我们并没有很刻意地去增加很多的功能，来让它看上去有很明显被“改版升级”的感觉，甚至做了很多的减法，比如：
1、把笔记本、子页面等层级都砍了，只保留文件夹 → 页面这样的结构，因为在使用专注笔记的时候，我们总在纠结，这样的层级关系，我们应该使用笔记本呢？还是子页面呢？还是文件夹呢？它们之间的作用太相似了，在每次使用的时候都要思考很久，这是意见很“反效率”的事情。
2、把很多花里胡哨的功能去了，比如各种各样的视图啊之类…</span>

🔥 Hi，我是小彭。本文已收录到 GitHub · AndroidFamily 中。这里有 Android 进阶成长知识体系，有志同道合的朋友，关注公众号 [彭旭锐] 带你建立核心竞争力。
前言
LeakCanary 是我们非常熟悉内存泄漏检测工具，它能够帮助开发者非常高效便捷地检测 Android 中常见的内存泄漏。在各大厂自研的内存泄漏检测框架（如腾讯 Matrix 和快手 Koom）的帮助文档中，也会引述 LeakCanary 原理分析。
不吹不黑，LeakCanary 源码中除了实现内存泄漏的监控方案外，还有非常多值得学习的编程技巧，只有沉下心去阅读的人才能够真正体会到。在这篇文章里，我将带你从入门开始掌握 LeakCanary 的使用场景以及使用方法，再介绍 LeakCanary 的工作流程和高级用法，最后通过源码解析深入理解原理。本文示例程序已上传到 Github： DemoHall · HelloLeakCanary ，有用请给 Star 支持，谢谢。
提示： 本文源码分析基于 2022 年 4 月发布的 LeakCanary 2.9.1。
本文原理分析涉及的 Java 虚拟机内存管理基础：
1、垃圾回收机制
2、引用机制：说一下 Java 的四种引用类型
3、Finalizer 机制：为什么 finalize() 方法只会执行一次

在上篇文章 深入浅出 Retrofit 中，就是通过 动态代理 来实现具体的网络请求逻辑。本着刨根究底的原则，这篇文章来探究一下动态代理的技术原理。
静态代理
在这之前，先来看一下基础的 静态代理 。
接口类 ICount 和实现类 Counter ：
public interface ICount {
    void test1();
    void test2();
}
​
public class Counter implements ICount {
​
    @Override
    public void test1() {
        System.out.println(&quot;test1&quot;);
    }
​
    @Override
    public void test2() {
        System.out.println(&quot;test2&quot;);
    }
}

现在要加一个需求，统计 Counter 类中每个方法的耗时。本着开闭原则，对扩展开放，对修改关闭，最好不要去动 Counter 原本的逻辑，可以提供一个同样实现 ICount 的代理类 CounterProxy ：
public class CounterProxy implements ICount {
​
    private Counter counter;
​
    public CounterProxy(Counter counter) {
        this.counter &#x3D; counter;
    }
​
    @Override
    public void test1() {
        long start &#x3D; System.currentTime…</span>

本文一个定制样式的SwitchButton，使用Compose来写是非常容易的，下面先来看看我们对外提供如下方法：
@Composeable
fun IosSwitchButton(
    modifier: Modifier,
    checked: Boolean,
    width: Dp &#x3D; 50.dp,
    height: Dp &#x3D; 30.dp,
    // Thumb和Track的边缘间距
    gapBetweenThumbAndTrackEdge: Dp &#x3D; 2.dp,
    checkedTrackColor: Color &#x3D; Color(0xFF4D7DEE),
    uncheckedTrackColor: Color &#x3D; Color(0xFFC7C7C7),
    onCheckedChange: ((Boolean) -&gt; Unit)
)

我们先来实现点击切换，后面再来实现滑动切换，checked状态是需要外面(ViewModel)传过来，同样onCheckedChange回调的状态，需要同步更新到ViewModel中。
我们来简单的看看，只实现，点击切换按钮状态的效果代码：
// 定义按钮点击的状态记录
val switchONState &#x3D; remember { mutableStateOf(checked) }
// Thumb的半径大小
val thumbRadius &#x3D; height / 2 - gapBetweenThumbAndTrackEdge
// Thumb水平的位移

登录拦截-方法池和消息回调的实现
登录拦截-线程的实现
登录拦截-协程的实现
登录拦截-Intent的实现
登录拦截-动态代理Hook的实现
登录拦截-拦截器模式的实现
前言
前面的一篇文章我们讲到了Intent原始的方法，虽然使用起来很麻烦但是还是能实现效果的，那有没有简便一点的封装？
有的，其实就和本篇的标题一样，早前网上还有这样的一种方案，使用动态代理+Hook的方式，替换启动Activity的对象，把全部的startActivity都拦截掉，替换掉我们自定义的Activiy。
如果都写死了所有的Activity跳转都写到一个拦截中，我们又如何实现拦截登录的功能呢？
我们整理一下思路：
我们需要先使用动态代理+Hook的方式替换全部的Activity启动。
我们在动态代理的回调中我们需要拿到原始的Intent，内部判断是否已经登录
如果已经登录，我们需要放行，直接执行原始的Intent方法。
如果没有登录，我们需要拦截，替换掉原始的Intentn，跳转到我们指定的Intent - LoginActivity的跳转。
那如何实现登录完成继续意图呢？还是和前面的文章一样，还是把之前的inent当参数传递给LoginActivity，然后让LoginActivity帮我们执行之前的Intent。
接下来我们一步一步来实现这个方案。
一、动态代理 + Hook 的实现
在之前的文章我们讲过插件化的实现有点类似，插件化一般是替换系统的 mInstrumentation 为自己的 Instrumentation 。
而我们这里没有这么麻烦，我们这里需要Hook的是ASM ，是A…</span>

                              <span>上一讲“猛药”过去，功效性的讲解就要小小告一段落了。在护肤金字塔的第二层，只剩下了“修护”这个话题，而在金字塔的顶端，“再生”我们还有没有提到。修护与再生，代表了皮肤自身的规律，修护受损的细胞，代谢老去的废物，同时刺激新的牺牲生成。修护和再生在一门交叉学科，很难把他们分开。那么就从这里开始，让我们看看修护和再生的秘诀。
什么是修护与再生
我们的皮肤，每天都冲在第一线，帮助我们抵御外界的侵袭，所以皮肤每天都在“受伤”，修护，就是要让我们的皮肤屏障更坚挺，保证皮肤能够处于正常的工作状态。
但修护并不等同于“包扎伤口”，不是只有当皮肤已经明显受损以后才需要修护，而更像是增强免疫力，需要从日常下手，维护皮肤的健康状态。所以，修护既是我们大妈们锻炼身体的广场舞，也是医生关键时刻可以救命的手术刀。
而再生，依赖于修护，又高于修护。修护的目的就是让皮肤获得健康稳定的状态，从而促使其再生，再生依赖于修护提供好的基础，同时又在修护的基础上提供和创造新生。
修护与再生的场景
不同的情况下，我们所选择的修护方法、成分、产品也不尽相同。
日常修护
大多数时候，我们需要的都只是日常的修护，目的是让白天工作了一天的皮肤得到舒缓和放松，类似于我们每晚的睡眠，是为了让皮肤可以继续保持一个健康稳定的状态。这种情况下，并不需要使用什么猛药，只需要选择皮肤容易吸收的，温和的产品，就可以达到我们的要求。这时修护的关键词是：温和。
晒后紧急修护
紫外线对皮肤的伤害，在防晒的一讲中已经充分解读（忘记了，可以回看这里），但有时候我们难免遇到极端天气，或者一时犯懒，防晒做的不好，导致皮肤被晒伤。这时皮肤往往处于一个非常脆弱的状态，继续急速有效的镇定，来帮助皮肤迅速回到相对稳定的状态。这时修护的关键词是：极速。
过敏修护
对于敏感肌同学，经常需要面对的就是解决自己的过敏问题，当皮肤受到一些并不耐受的刺激，就会激发皮肤的自我…</span>

进度条是个好东西，在日常的工作生活中，总会有一些场景是它能大展身手的。
做项目管理时，我们能通过一个里程碑的进度条，了解其下多个任务的整体进度；做预算管理时，设置好每个类别的预算上限，进度条就能告诉我们各个类别下的预算使用情况；测评打分时，进度条也能直观展示各评分项之下，打分对象的得分情况（比如餐厅的口味、环境、服务），方便我们对比绝对值、相对值。
如果你是一名 Notion 的资深用户，可能已经早早的在 Notion 数据库中用上了进度条，但你可能不知道，Notion 最近的一项更新，让进度条对 Notion 新手变得更低门槛、触手可及了。
在这篇 Notion 进度条教程中，我将围绕此次更新的进度条功能，介绍这 4 点内容：

Notion 新推出的进度条功能
相比原有方案，新的进度条好在哪
哪些地方可以使用新进度条
如何设置进度条

希望通过这篇文章，能帮助你更好的使用 Notion、释放自己的生产力。
原生支持的新进度条
大约 4 天前，Notion 官方发布了一条推文，宣布为进度条增加了原生支持。

从原推文的动图中可见，在 Notion 的数据库中，可以根据给定的属性值生成进度条图形，并紧邻数字显示，目前有条形（Bar）、环形（Ring）这两种可选样式：
Notion 官推里，用动图演示了进度条的设置操作
我也在自己的数据库中尝试了这两种样式，数字阅读起来确实会更直观一些。
条形进度条环形进度条
如果看到这里，你已经迫不及待想用起来了，可以通过目录直接跳至最后一章了解如何设置，如果你还想了解新进度条的便捷性、适用范围…</span>

                              <span>前言
理性聊车，高尔夫也很好，特斯拉也很棒，奔驰宝马大家都喜欢，在此分享一下购车的一些想法和感受，祝大家都拥有自己的爱车。
我自认从工作以来和车的缘分还是非常深的，从 4S 销售到广告策划，又因为接触大众、斯柯达更多，再到家里换了奥迪后，与其说是喜欢，不如说是对这种德系品牌的习惯。结合到家里本身有车，我的车就不需要承担「家庭重任」，可以随我喜欢。但提车后的这一个多月，这台小车让我开始强烈的感受到「家的责任」。
提车日
购车在上海上半年疫情解封之后，去到奥迪4S店，看到店里积压了较多库存，当时我自己也没有特别倾向的颜色，A3的颜色除了红色我都挺喜欢，就在库存的冰川白、探戈红、环焦蓝、纳瓦拉蓝中，选择了较深的纳瓦拉蓝，张扬的造型配一个低调内敛的颜色。中配（时尚运动）的车型上，库存车上额外增加了四门无钥匙进入（+¥2000），加上购置税减半政策，实际落地20万不到。

奢侈与吝啬的交织
20万买 A0 小车，奢侈
最开始的选车首先当然是预算，20万以内，另外优先紧凑级，SUV 或 Sedan 我并不是特别在意，但两厢车型是我比较青睐的。第八代高尔夫和 A3 Sportsback 是最后的二选一，同样的预算高尔夫可以买到顶配 R-Line 版本，拥有更多的科技配置。而 A3 在20万内，只能说配置相对实用一些，没有氛围灯、副驾驶电动座椅等等这些。
网上说的最多的，就是 A3 不过是换壳高尔夫，还要加钱。说对也对，但在做工和实际的细微体验上，还是会有所差异。其实最后更促成下单的，是展厅销售的态度，毕业那年我自己也做过汽车销售，了解一些展厅里的道道。你如果问我，是不是有虚荣心的成本，那我的答案是肯定的。

不加2万上顶配，吝啬
从升级配置来看，时尚运动与豪华运动之间，相差近2万，增加了：

30色内饰氛围灯
电动折叠后视镜，带副驾驶侧下翻
副驾驶电动座椅与多向调节
三温区空调

九月将至，大一新生踏入校园的同时，大四「老油条」们也开始准备自己的毕业论文与实习工作。学年论文与毕业论文时本科生绕不过的一座大山，以下是我在大四撰写论文时积累的一些个人经验与见解，希望对学弟、学妹们的论文写作有所帮助。
电子资源
文科专业的大部分学生在本科阶段，了解学界研究会借助知网、万方数据等文献数据库。国内高校图书馆也会购买文献数据库的使用权限，方便校内教职工与学生使用。在校园网中打开图书馆的网站，找到电子资源栏目，便可以看到学校已购买的电子数据库。除了学校提供的电子资源，不少地方图书馆对当地公众与读者提供电子资源，如国家图书馆、浙江图书馆在注册后便可免费使用。

扩展阅读：《免费看论文？除了学校的图书馆，还有 ……》

当我们搜索某个领域的文献，数据库会返回不少的文章，文章的质量良莠不齐，参考文献的作用时帮助你了解研究话题的学术现状、存在问题、解决方法等，导师进行论文指导也会强调尽量挑选时间较新的「核心期刊」与「原始文献」，注重文献的权威性、专业性与时效性。在数据库搜索时，我们可以通过筛选功能，选择来自「核心期刊」的文献，如北大核心、南大核心、SCI、EI、SSCI 等期刊目录。
期刊筛选
大部分阅读与参考的文献我是从万方数据下载的，PDF 文档方便在不同的软件中阅读与文献管理，二是万方提供的 PDF 文档默认自带目录与文字图层，知网（大陆版）默认只提供 CAJ 格式的文档，缺德到家。
Word 主题样式
不少大学生在「制造学术垃圾」使用的主流写作工具是 Microsoft Word，最头疼的除了正文写作，还有学术论文的格式规范。一篇学术论文的结构大致可分为以下四大部分：封面、目录、正文以及引用。
论文结构
以我大学的《毕业论文档案打印和格式要求》为例，除去页面设置、撰写规范、字词符号用法等要求，大部分内容的格式涉及到 Word 中的字…</span>

                              <span>为了给新人创作者提供制作播客的参考，此前播客志对录音场地、录音设备、后期工具、AU使用教程进行了大规模征集及分享，邀请故事FM、日谈公园、深夜谈谈等播客机构，Steve、重轻、艾文和金花等资深创作者进行分享。
本次推送延续此前的逻辑，在有了场地、设备等硬件设施后，分享一档节目如何诞生。也可以说是内容创作的SOP（标准流程），邀请声东击西、日谈公园、津津乐道、深夜谈谈、番薯剥壳工作室，讲述专业播客机构的内容生产流程，如何保证节目质量始终保持一定水准？如何协调不同工种间的工作？一期节目上线前要经历什么？
每期精品内容的产出都是在推动播客朝着行业化的方向发展，感谢各大机构工作人员的热情参与！

审核和内容收集
(虽然是具体情况具体分析，但是对于部分节目可以固定下来)
 
1、资料完善度
主持人需要详细的提纲，这对后面流程完善起到重要作用
主持人需要提交的是:嘉宾资料(姓名正确书写、头衔、照片、希望给到的社交媒体账号)+**建议标题**+采访内容&amp;提纲+音频收集+建议删除内容
 
2、素材给到时间(1.5 小时，2 人对话)
负责人:主播+监制
素材一般提前7天，至少不晚于3/4日给到
 
3 播客完成版提交审核的时间
负责人:后期
后期的制作的重点永远是:时间节点，如果只给到2天时间制作，请用好这两天时间，没必要永远优化细化无止境的美化下去。
理想的完成版审核日期，是上线前1日以上，如果无法在1日之前提交，请提前在群中说明原因
 
此外:剪辑之前请提前和节目负责人(主播/监制)确认:是否需要给嘉宾审核，考虑到嘉宾时差(如北美时间)、工作繁忙(大公司CEO)，可能需要跨自然日审核，所以最好上线前至少两天给到嘉宾粗剪版用来审核.
 
比如周二上线商业Y酱，周一需要提交音频审核，如果周一无法提交审核，需要周五说明情况
 
 
剪辑时需要注意的细节

软件的选择与流程的建立
在漫长的学习之路上，我遇到了学习软件，它们和我磨合、指导我的学习、被我不断的筛选。在这个过程中我逐渐有了一些想法来选择软件，并最终建立流程。
软件的主要特性-一切的基础
我也许从来都是一个缺少方法的人，直到软件进入我的生活，与其说它们是工具，不如说它们是我的一部分关于学习的性格。 我从不对软件硬性要求，要求它符合我的工作流程或是符合我的方法论，我对它们抱有了更大的期望，我对那些能做我以前做不到的事的软件抱有期望，因为它们的价值是难以衡量的。 于是我要求它有某种特性，可以与我使用的软件区别出来，完成我曾经难以完成的工作。
方法论-以实际的场景体现
软件的诞生一开始就会被打上开发者的烙印，就像是同样的教科书，不同的主编会有不同的侧重一样。如果一个软件有着鲜明的主要功能特色那它几乎一定体现着某种思想，但是方法论存在着问题，就是难以证伪，越是想用思想捏合成一座大厦最后会发现地基可能都是不牢的。那么如何使用方法论呢？
1. 与科学接轨，学习有关知识；对信息源可信度进行筛选
2. 在使用中验证方法论，最好有一定程度的量化
3. 简化抽象方法论，细化具体方法论不至于在臃肿中走向模糊
4. 重视全面和逻辑性 
扯远了，在软件的方法论验证中，重要的无疑是第二条。 如何验证呢，就是在它主张的场景使用它（或仅仅是想象使用），注意它的价值，这是我认为最好的方式，一个好的软件应该是向你描绘了一个出色高效的使用过程。 另一种方法是看受人欢迎的软件，某种意义上来说它的有效经过了人的验证，注意它的独特性即可。
软件的使用与功能的解构
当我们使用一款软件，很多情况下并不是按照作者给出的使用场景进行使用，但这不意味着这种使用是错误的，因为开发者不可能列出所有的使用场景，也与你的面对的场景不尽相同。了解软件的边界重点在于对其功能的理解。
