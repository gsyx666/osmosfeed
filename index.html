Through its dynamic presentation of content, webmasters have the flexibility to create beautiful and useful websites easily. Through its system of filters and hooks, WordPress allows developers to extend functionality through pieces of code called functions, which can be grouped into separate executables called &quot;plugins&quot;. It is also possible to customize a WordPress installation via the creation of custom themes.

                              <span>Introduction


Matplotlib is the “grandfather” library of data visualization with Python. John Hunter created it. He created it to try to replicate MatLab’s (another programming language) plotting capabilities in Python. So if you are familiar with MatLab, matplotlib will feel natural to you. It is an excellent 2D and 3D graphics library for generating scientific figures.

Matplotlib allows you to create reproducible figures programmatically. Let’s learn how to use it! Before continuing this lecture, I encourage you just to explore the official Matplotlib web page: http://matplotlib.org/ 
To install matplotlib on your system, you have to run this code on your command line:
&gt;&gt; pip install matplotlib

To use matplotlib in our code, first, we have to import it. We will Import the matplotlib.p…</span>

You can also enjoy a very extraordinary natural state. Also this tourist spot is very suitable to be used as an object for pre-wedding photos.
2. Mentigen Hill
3. Madakaripura Waterfall
4. Bromo Milky Way
5. Penanjakan Point 1
The height of this climb 1 is at 2770m above sea level. So at this altitude it is very suitable to see the sunrise plus the background of three very beautiful mountains.
6. Whispering Sand
7. Savannah
8. Pura Luhur Poten
Rainbow Coban Waterfall
Finally, there is an interesting destination when there is a beam of sunlight that refracts because of the water, namely the Coban Pelangi waterfall.
From the name, we certainly already know how beautiful this tour is, with the refraction of light in a luxurious and attractive waterfall, a small rainbow is born that is very pleasing to the eye.
The natural state of this tour is still fairly natural because of the many wild plants that still grow around the beautiful waterfall.
You are suitable to come here during the day when the eye of the heart is above your head, because it will emit light and refract optimally, in the afternoon the refraction of the light will begin to fade.
That&#x27;s an interesting tourist spot and is in a very beautiful location of Mount Bromo.
Try all these tourist destinations and feel the sensation that you will feel.

Oh, I wish!😨 

Let&#x27;s understand these one by one - 
You enter some input 


Browser parses the input to check if its a url or a search query. 


For URL, it -

Once the response is fetched, it - 



Once renderer process receives the IPC and data stream, it -
Starts parsing the HTML received. HTML received is in bytes format.



DOM (the data structure browsers use to process html into web pages) - it contains all the nodes of HTML and their relationships. 
When parser comes across downloading resources(like css, js, assets like fonts, image, video), it sends requests to the network thread in the browser process.

Why and what is metadata?
Google crawler iterates over the web pages and fetches the website information such as title, description, images, and tags to give accurate search results to the user.
Understand the logic in the simplest way, if google can easily read all the pages on your website and their corresponding data easily better it can recommend and give it to the users.
How Twitter created the validation cards
Metadata consists of website basic information such as title, banner image, description, tags, and so on. Using this information Twitter generates those cool cards in a fraction of seconds.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are cryptographic assets on a blockchain that can be distinguished from one another by their distinctive identifying codes and metadata. A digital asset known as an NFT is a representation of a real-world item, such as artwork, music, in-game items, or films. They are regularly purchased and traded online in exchange for other cryptocurrencies, and they are typically encoded using the same software as many other cryptocurrencies.
The same kind of programming that is used to develop cryptocurrencies is typically used to create NFTs. These cryptographic assets are built on blockchain technology, to put it simply. They cannot be traded or exchanged in the same manner as other cryptographic assets.
NFT stands for a non-fungible token, which means tha…</span>

This App will be completely depends on API.
So basically this is going to be a beginner-friendly project, so let&#x27;s make this project step-by-step.
Basic knowledge of ReactJS.
Basic knowledge of React hooks.
Good knowledge of React Components.
Now before jumping into the code, let&#x27;s get the API and Key which we will use for this project. For that, we have to move to openweather.org site and just login to get API key. After that, in our App.js component, we have added a c…</span>

                              <span>GitHub Copilot 被诉“规模空前的软件盗版”

周四，有程序员在旧金山提起诉讼，称其代表数百万可能受每月 10 美元的 Copilot 服务影响的 GitHub 用户。该诉讼旨在挑战 GitHub Copilot 的合法性。诉讼对象包括 GitHub 其所有者微软，以及为该工具提供支持的 OpenAI。该诉讼认为“被告已经侵犯了大量创作者的合法权利，这些创作者在 GitHub 上根据某些开源许可证发布代码或其他作品。”包括 MIT 许可证、GPL 许可证和 Apache 许可证等 11 个流行的开源许可证，都要求注明作者姓名和版权。Copilot 违反并删除这些许可证，“因此，它正在实施规模空前的软件盗版行为。”

老王点评：虽然可能是旷日持久的诉讼，但是目前的 AI 没有理会开源许可证就直接拿过来用代码的方式，肯定是有问题的。




经过六年等待，Rust 终于支持通用关联类型了

最新的 Rust 稳定版 1.65.0 支持了通用关联类型（GAT），可以在关联类型上声明生命期、类型和常量泛型。Rust 官方称，“很难用几个字来形容这些东西有多有用。”为了支持 GAT，必须对编译器进行大量的修改，而这项功能的 RFC 是 2016 年提出的。总的来说，GAT 为大量的模式和 API 提供了基础性的依据。大量项目因为 GAT 的稳定而受阻。即使你不需要直接使用 GAT，你所使用的库也很有可能在内部或公开场合使用它，很多时候，GAT 是唯一实现方式。

老王点评：Rust 越来越发展完善，真的可以预期成为主要的底层语言。




谷歌计划建立支持世界上 1000 种最常用的语言的 AI 模型

该公司公布了一个经过 400 多种语言训练的 AI 模型，它将其描述为 “目前在语音模型中看到的最大的语言覆盖范围”，并宣布建立一个支持 1000 种语言的模型。谷歌认为，创建一个如此规模的模型将使其更容易将各种人工智能功能带入在线空间和人工智能训练数据集中表现不佳的语言（也被称为 “低资源语言”）。谷歌称，建立单一模型，而不是建立 1000 种不同的模型，有助于 AI 将从高资源语言获得的能力转化为低资源语言的能力。

                              <span>安卓的一个重要进展是将安卓开源项目Android Open Source Project（AOSP）移植到 RISC-V 处理器架构。




AOSP 已经开始在上游启用 RISC-V，这将促进 RISC-V CPU 在可穿戴设备、物联网，以及最终在智能手机和笔记本电脑中的使用。

为了开放生态系统，中国科学院 PLCT 实验室的工程师和软件开发人员在 2020 年开始将 Android 10 移植到 RISC-V 架构上。阿里巴巴的云计算部门和平头哥芯片子公司一起努力保持开发与最新的安卓版本同步。

“我们很高兴看到谷歌对构建针对 RISC-V 的 AOSP 的更多支持！阿里云一直致力于通过一系列的创新来支持 RISC-V 社区的发展，比如将安卓的基本功能移植到 RISC-V 上，这证明了在从多媒体到信号处理、设备互联和人工智能等场景中使用基于 RISC-V 的设备的可行性。”阿里云生态系统总监、RISC-V 国际组织的应用与工具水平委员会副主席 David Chen 博士说：“我们期待着与安卓团队合作，为繁荣的 RISC-V 社区做出贡献。”

通过增强 RISC-V 上的安卓系统的基本功能，在 2021 年，阿里云的专家们付出了巨大的努力，积极推动了软件生态系统的发展。 RISC-V on Android 的工作集中在 RISC-V Android 工作组和软件库中进行。

                              <span>git log 命令是 Git 中一个很重要的查看提交记录的工具，它也是人们喜欢使用 Git 的原因之一。


git log 命令能够让你了解到更多关于贡献者 提交commit 的记录。使用 git log 的一种方式是按日期查看提交记录 。要查看在指定日期或日期范围内创建的 Git 存储库中的提交记录，请使用带有选项 --since 或 --until 或者同时使用以上两个选项的 git log 命令。

首先，进入你要查看的分支（例如，main 分支）：

$ git checkout main


接下来，你可以使用以下命令，来显示当前日期（即今天）的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since&#x3D;&quot;yesterday&quot;


仅显示某一特定用户（例如，用户 Agil）在今天的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since&#x3D;&quot;yesterday&quot; --author&#x3D;&quot;Agil&quot;


还可以显示在某一日期范围内的提交记录。使用以下命令，显示在任意两个日期之间（例如，2022 年 4 月 22 日至 2022 年 4 月 24 日）的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since&#x3D;&quot;2022-04-22&quot; --until&#x3D;&quot;2022-04-24&quot;


在上面这个例子中，会输出 2022 年 4 月 22 日至 2022 年 4 月 24 日期间，不包括 2022 年 4 月 22 日的所有提交记录。如果你想要包括 2022 年 4 月 22 日的提交记录，请将命令中的 2022-04-22 替换为 2022-04-21。

运行以下命令，能够显示某一特定用户（例如，用户 Agil）在两个指定的日期之间的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since&#x3D;&quot;2022-04-22&quot; --until&#x3D;&quot;2022-04-24&quot; --author&#x3D;&quot;Agil&quot;


总结

Git 有很多优点，其中一个优点就是 Git 让你能够收集你项目的相关数据。git log 命令是一个重要的查看提交记录的工具，也是人们喜欢使用 Git 的原因之一！

                              <span>这个带有脚本的快速指南有助于清理旧的 Snap 版本并释放 Ubuntu 系统中的一些磁盘空间。


我正在使用的 Ubuntu 测试系统中的磁盘空间不足。因此，我通过 GNOME 的磁盘使用分析器进行调查，以找出哪个包正在消耗宝贵的 SSD 空间。除了通常的缓存和主目录，令我惊讶的是，我发现 Snap 和 Flatpak 消耗了大量的存储空间。



尽管如此，我始终坚持一个规则：除非必要，否则不要使用 Snap 或 Flatpak。这主要是因为它们的安装尺寸和其他问题。我更喜欢原生 deb 和 rpm 包。多年来，我在这个测试系统中安装和移除了一定数量的 Snap 包。

但卸载后还有问题。Snap 在系统中保留了一些残留文件，一般用户不知道。

所以我打开了 Snap 文件夹 /var/lib/snapd/snaps，发现 Snap 保留了以前安装/卸载的软件包的旧版本。

例如，在下图中，你可以看到 GNOME 3.28、3.34 和 Wine 都被删除了。但它们还在那里。发生这种情况是因为 Snap 的设计，它在正确卸载后保留已卸载软件包的版本。



或者，你可以在终端中使用：

snap list --all




对于保留的版本，默认值为 3。这意味着 Snap 会保留每个软件包的三个旧版本，包括活动版本。如果你对磁盘空间没有限制，这是可以的。

但是对于服务器和其他情况，这很容易遇到成本问题，它会消耗你的磁盘空间。

但是，你可以使用以下命令轻松修改计数。该值可以在 2 到 20 之间。

sudo snap set system refresh.retain&#x3D;2


清理 Snap 版本

在 SuperUser 的一篇文章中，Canonical 的前工程经理 Popey 提供了一个简单的脚本，它可以清理旧版本的 Snaps 并保留最新版本。

这是我们将用来清理 Snap 的脚本。

#!/bin/bash
#Removes old revisions of snaps
#CLOSE ALL SNAPS BEFORE RUNNING THIS
set -eu
LANG&#x3D;en_US.UTF-8 snap list --all | awk &#x27;/disabled/{print $1, $3}&#x27; |
while read snapname revision; do
    snap remove &quot;$snapname&quot; --revision&#x3D;&quot;$revision&quot;
done


将上面的脚本以 .sh 扩展名保存在一个目录中（例如 clean_snap.sh），赋予它可执行权限并运行。

chmod +x clean_snap.sh


当我运行脚本后，它减少了很多磁盘空间。该脚本还将显示要删除的包的名称。





结束语

对于 Snap 的设计效率如何，人们总是争论不休。许多人说，它的设计是坏的，是臃肿的，是消耗系统资源的。这种说法的某些部分是真实的，我不会否认它。如果实施和加强得当，整个沙盒应用的概念是很好的。但我相信，与 Snap 相比，Flatpak 工作做得更好。

也就是说，我希望这可以帮助你清理一些磁盘空间。尽管它只在 Ubuntu 中进行了测试，但它应该适用于所有支持 Snap 的 Linux 发行版。

此外，请查看我们关于 如何清理 Ubuntu 的指南以及其他步骤。

最后，如果你要清理 Flatpak 应用，请参阅 这篇指南。

Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder and former CEO, responded to the mass layoffs under Elon Musk’s ownership by saying he owns “the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation” and that he grew the company “too quickly.” On Friday, Musk laid off about half of Twitter’s workforce, affecting employees across all departments.
“Folks at Twitter past and present are strong and resilient. They will always find a way no matter how difficult the moment,” Dorsey writes. “I realize many are angry with me. I own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation: I grew the company size too quickly. I apologize for that.”

Twitter’s app on iOS has been updated to support Elon Musk’s $7.99 per month Twitter Blue. The app’s latest update on the Apple App Store says you have to pay for Blue to get verified on the platform “just like the celebrities, companies, and politicians you already follow.”
The new Twitter Blue subscription isn’t available just yet, though. Esther Crawford, a product manager at Twitter confirmed it’s not live right now but says some users “may see us making updates because we are testing and pushing changes in real-time.”


Twitter shipped its new Blue subscription for verification ahead of Musk’s Monday deadline given to employees. I updated and verified accounts are now the first tab of notifications. pic.twitter.com/xfTl3b3GYk

Apple’s building an advertising network as part of its deal to start streaming Major League Soccer (MLS) games next year, according to a report from Bloomberg. Sources familiar with the situation told the outlet that Apple’s in talks with advertisers and MLS sponsors to display ads during soccer games and “related shows.”
Apple struck a 10-year deal with the MLS in June and will start streaming soccer games through its Apple TV app in February 2023. While the company plans on introducing a separate, Sunday Ticket-like subscription dedicated to streaming every MLS game, it says it’ll make a “broad selection” of MLS and Leagues Cup matches available to Apple TV Plus subscribers, with a “limited number” available for free.

And we’ve got some bangers for you this week because Sony’s WF-1000XM4 earbuds are on sale for an all-time low of around $178 at Amazon and Target until tomorrow. That’s around $100 off their regular price of $278, and much better than the typical $30 discount we see.

一位工程师用两台不带显示器的 Commodore 64 “古代”电脑作为键盘，用五寸软盘粘在一起作为风箱，制作了一台可以演奏的手风琴。这个项目采用了大量定制的软件和硬件黑科技。通过测量风箱挤压时通过的空气噪音并转换为信号。Commodore 电脑本身没有音频设备，音频信号是通过插孔输出发声的。Commodore 64 是有史以来最畅销的电脑，于 1982 年开始生产。

Web 之父说 Web3 根本不是互联网

发明 Web 的蒂姆·伯纳斯-李在里斯本周五举行的 Web 峰会上表示，“真正的 Web3 的名字被以太坊的人拿去做区块链的东西，这真是一个耻辱。事实上，Web3 根本就不是 Web。”Web3 是科技界的一个模糊的术语，用来描述一个假设的未来版本的互联网，它比今天更去中心化，而不被各大巨头所支配。他认为需要澄清 Web 3 和 Web 3.0，并开发了自己的 Web 3.0 项目 Solid。

但是，在 Ventoy 出道之前，WoeUSB 是用于创建可启动 Windows USB 的首选工具。原版 WoeUSB 工程在 2014 年左右香消玉损。

鉴于其流行程度，一位新的开发者接过了将其起死回生的任务。因此，WoeUSB-ng 诞生了。在这里，“ng” 是 新生代new generation 的缩写。换句话说，WoeUSB-ng 是新生代的 WoeUSB 。但是，因为原版的工具已经不存在了，我将 WoeUSB-ng 描述为 WoeUSB 。

在这篇教程中，我将向你展示如何在 Ubuntu Linux 上安装 WoeUSB 。我也将分享使用 WoeUSB 来创建可启动 Windows USB 的步骤。

但是，在此之前，让我们快速查看这个令人惊叹的工具的特色。

WoeUSB



WoeUSB 是一个简单的工具，其唯一的目的是 在 Linux 上创建可启动 Windows USB 。

原版 WoeUSB 是一个 shell 脚本。这个原版 WoeUSB 被使用 Python 重写为 WoeUSB-ng ，它可以安装在你的系统上，并且通过命令行或 GUI 界面。

特色：


支持老式 PC 启动或 UEFI 启动

支持 FAT32 和 NTFS 文件系统

支持使用物理安装盘或磁盘镜像作为源

它可以用于 Windows Vista 及其更高版本的任意语言或变体版本

老式的 MBR/IBM PC 兼容启动模式

本机 UEFI 启动支持 Windows 7 及其更高版本的镜像（仅限于将 FAT 文件系统作为目标的情况）

                              <span>以下是快速检查在运行 Xorg 还是 Wayland 显示服务器的方法。


随着时间的推移，现代 Wayland 显示服务器正在进入所有 Linux 发行版。尽管老旧的 Xorg 仍然能用并且会继续存在，但 Wayland 无疑在安全性和其他性能方面更好。

但是，Xorg 不会很快完全淘汰。可能永远不会。

如果你在运行任何 Linux 发行版，如何检查运行的是 Xorg 还是 Wayland？下面是方法。

Wayland 或 Xorg：你在运行哪一个？

在你的 Linux 发行版（例如 Ubuntu、Fedora、Arch 等）中打开一个终端窗口（CTRL+ALT+T）。

然后输入以下命令并回车：

echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE


命令输出会告诉你当前会话是 Wayland 还是 Xorg（X11）。

[debugpoint@fedora ~]$ echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPEwayland




这很简单。但是，还有其他方法。

其他方法

使用设置

如果你需要图形方法，请打开你的 Linux 发行版的设置应用。在关于部分，你应该看到某个标签下中的 Wayland/X11。

例如，在 GNOME 设置中，你可以在 “窗口子系统Windowing system” 下找到它，如下图所示：



使用会话值

你还可以使用 systemd 登录管理器 loginctl 找到它。请记住，它仅适用于基于 systemd 的系统。

打开终端并运行以下命令。你可以看到会话 id 值。在此示例中为 c2：

loginctl


现在，将会话 ID 传递给以下命令以获取显示服务器类型。确保将 c2 更改为你的系统规格。

loginctl show-session c2 -p Type




总结

这些是你可以确定在 Linux 系统中运行的是 Systemd 还是 Xorg 的一些方法。你还可以在 shell 脚本中使用上述命令来实现进一步的流程自动化。

祝好。

                              <span>我向所有的 Linux 初学者推荐以下这些命令。




在使用 Linux 命令行时，很容易就会迷失方向，这可能会导致灾难性的后果：我有一次使用删除命令 rm 删除文件，然而删除之后我才意识到我刚刚是删除了计算机的引导目录。后来，我学会了使用 pwd 命令，来知道当前在文件系统的哪个目录下；并且我使用了 trashy 和 trash-cli 这一命令行回收站工具（LCTT 译注：在删除文件时 trash-cli 会充当中间人，将文件先“删除”到桌面上的垃圾箱中，能够通过垃圾箱或通过终端的 trash 命令，来恢复垃圾箱中已删除的文件。）

当我刚开始使用 Linux 时，我有一个放在桌子上的“速查表”，它就是《101 条你应该知道的 Linux 命令》，我在管理 Linux 服务器时能参考速查表上面的这些命令。随着我越来越熟悉这些命令，我越来越精通服务器管理了。

以下是我认为最有用的 12 个 Linux 命令。

1、打印工作目录（pwd）

pwd 命令会打印出你的工作目录。换句话来说，它输出你当前所在目录的路径。pwd 命令有两种选项：-L 或 --logical（即逻辑路径）用来打印当前的目录路径（不解析符号链接），-P 或 --physial（即物理路径）会打印出解析符号链接后的物理目录。（LCTT 译注：你可以进一步阅读我们翻译的 另一篇文章。）

2、创建目录（mkdir）

使用 mkdir 命令来创建一个新目录，是非常容易的。以下命令，创建了一个名为 example 目录（若 example 已存在，则无法创建）：

$ mkdir example


你也可以在嵌套地创建目录及其子目录：

$ mkdir -p example/one/two


如果目录 example 和目录 one 都已存在，则仅会创建目录 two…</span>

Years ago while rummaging through the contents of a shelf in a used bookstore, I happened upon a booklet titled &quot;UNIX System Command Summary for Berkeley 4.2 &amp; 4.3 BSD,&quot; published by Specialized Systems Consultants. I bought it as a curiosity item because it was nearly 20 years old yet still largely applicable to modern Linux and BSD.
That amused me then and now. A booklet written in 1986 was still largely relevant in 2016, while books on the same shelf about a proprietary OS weren&#x27;t worth the paper they were printed on. (Think about it: What technology do you think is going to survive a zombie apocalypse?) I&#x27;ve had the booklet on my own bookshelf for several years now, but it occurred to me that it&#x27;s pro…</span>

                              <span>Kuiq - the way you ship your API in 10 sec ⚡

Why did I make Kuiq?
I am looking to complete the product as quickly as possible, especially for MVP stuff. And I&#x27;m sure you all have the same opinion 😗

When deploying APIs, whether Firebase or AWS, I think you need to create a project and configure it in advance. When you are making an MVP for a product, this kind of hassle is very disturbing :/

Kuiq eliminates all of this hassle and allows you to deploy your API as soon as you log in to Kuiq 😁

Is this the same as Deno Deploy?
Almost same. But different pricing model.

Future of Kuiq
✍️ Create a VSCode extension so code can be sent directly from VSCode to Kuiq

🤖 API with Database concept (not sure yet)
When we do backend processing with API, we often want to manipulate the database.
For example, storing customer email data.
So I thought that having a database connected to an API that can be easily deployed might speed up the development of the product :)

Looking forward to your thought!

                              <span>@packwhale) and I’m thrilled to launch today on Product Hunt!!!
About me: I’ve been working in online marketing for nearly a decade and I’ve always been curious about new tools that can make my life as a marketer easier.

I’ve often seen people stare at their Google Analytics dashboard without really doing something actionable or meaningful to understand what’s going on with their data. 

So I created the Google Analytics Pack for Coda to analyze my data, generate notes, and facilitate discussions with my team so we improve our website’s performance. You can even set up automations when you hit milestones—like Slacking your team when web traffic hits 1M views. Here’s a glimpse of what you can do:

✅ Use cases: 
* Build and share custom reports for your team and stakeholders. 
* Invite your team to analyze your website’s performance together.
* Make data-based decisions, plan your marketing campaigns, and build custom automations for your data. 

Special thanks to the @coda_hq team for their support 🙌

                              <span>记账是我坚持得最久的习惯，到如今已经快4年。
期间有中断过，怀疑过，也尝试过很多不同的工具，发现用对工具的确轻松很多，也更容易坚持。今天就来跟大家分享下我记账这些年的心路历程，希望能帮到正在犹豫记账的你。
我会先讲下我是如何坚持记账，以及记账对我的改变，最后再分享记账应用（附带视频），只想看评测的话可以直接跳到最后哦。
一、如何开始记账
我之所以开始记账，也是因为发现自己每个月钱都不知花哪去了，所以想通过记账来了解自己的收支情况，让自己对生活掌控得更好。
一开始是消费一单就记一次，但太繁琐了，经常会忘记。所以就改成了每天固定睡前记账。但这样，依旧老是忘记，于是我设置了每晚10点的定时闹钟，效果就好很多了。等到养成习惯后，就再也不用设置闹钟了，以后一到那个点，脑子就自动提醒我记账，偶有遗忘，但也慢慢坚持下来了。而且因为我用打卡app，所以如果没记账，那天的记录就会为空，出于强迫症的原因，我也一定会把缺的那天补上。就这么不知不觉坚持了快4年。
但其实，我这种每一笔都记的方式还是比较费劲的，不一定适合所有人，我这里推荐两个降低难度的方式：

别全部都都记，这样太琐碎，而是设置一个额度，高于该额度的支出才记。
是充分利用记账应用，选择有自动同步账单功能，或者支持语音输入的记账应用，下面有推荐类似的App。

二、对记账的反思
那我这样记账4年下来的结果如何呢？
一方面，我的确因此免去了许多不必要的开支，存住了钱，对比起身边一些朋友，有储蓄更踏实，还可以把闲钱拿出来投资理财。
但另一方面，我也明显感觉自己似乎有点 落伍了......当同龄人在炫耀新买的电子产品、潮牌、口红包包时，当别人用钱堆出来一个时髦大方的形象时，其实很难不羡慕。可是让我去购买一些非必需品，这带来的罪恶感，又远大于我得到它的满足感。

是的，记账的习惯，让我的消费习惯变成了——只买有用的东西。

Creating a table in Lua
To create a table in Lua, you instantiate the table with an arbitrary name:
mytable &#x3D; {}
There are different ways you can structure your data in a table. You could fill…</span>

                              <span>用这个方便的捕鼠器比喻来理解编译代码。


源代码必须要经过编译才能够运行程序，而对于开源软件，每个人都可以获取源代码。无论你是自己编写了代码，想要编译和运行它，还是下载了某人的项目来尝试它，了解如何通过 编译器 处理源代码，以及编译器如何处理这些代码，这都很有用。

创建一个更好的捕鼠器

一般情况我们不会将一个捕鼠器比作电脑，但不管你信不信，它确实与你正在使用的设备（手机或电脑）的 CPU 有一些相似之处。经典的捕鼠器（我说的不是 🐈）有两种状态：打开或者释放。你可以认为 打开 是将捕鼠器设置好准备捕获老鼠，以及 释放 是捕鼠器被老鼠触发。某种意义上来说，捕鼠器就像是一台有鼠标的电脑。你可以想象一下这个代码，用一种虚构的语言来描述这个过程：

if mousetrap &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 then
  There&#x27;s a mouse!
else
  There&#x27;s no mouse yet.
end


换句话说，你可以基于捕鼠器的状态发现是否有老鼠（数据）。当然，捕鼠器不是万无一失的，有可能有一只老鼠在捕鼠器旁边，由于老鼠还没有触发捕鼠器，所以它的状态还是 打开 的。因此该程序可以进行改进，这都是非常典型的。

开关

总的来说，捕鼠器就是一个开关。你会在家里使用开关打开灯。可以从开关中获得许多信息。比如，人们会从你家灯的状态了解到你是否在家。

你可以根据邻居家灯的状态来改变行为。如果邻居家所有的灯都熄灭了，那么请关掉你大声的音乐，因为人们可能已经上床睡觉了。

CPU 也使用这样的逻辑，只不过乘以几个数量级，缩小到了微观级别。当 CPU 在特定寄存器上接收到电信号时，可以触发其他一些寄存器，然后触发另一个，以此类推。如果这些寄存器有特定的意义，那么就可以通信。也许激活同一主板上某处的芯片，或者使 LED 亮起，或者改变屏幕上的像素颜色。

                              <span>Linux Lite 6.2 是一个理想的升级，带来一些有用的变化，没什么太花哨的东西。




Linux Lite 是一种流行的轻量级的类 Windows 发行版，为用户提供了一个熟悉的操作系统感受。

最新版本 Linux Lite 6.2 基于 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS，对 UI 进行了各种更改以及各种错误的修复。

Linux Lite 6.2：有什么新功能？



此版本的 Linux Lite 侧重于用户界面调整和错误修复，并对一些应用程序进行了更改。

一些主要亮点包括：


更新的图标

新壁纸

Shotcut 视频编辑器

删除微软 Teams

LibreOffice 7.3.6.2

Linux 内核 5.15


Shotcut 取代 OpenShot



是的，Shotcut 现在取代了 OpenShot，成为 Linux Lite 6.2 上的默认视频编辑器。

OpenShot 之所以被删除，是因为它不能很好地与 Ubuntu 22.04 配合使用，而如果没有一个好用的视频编辑器，用户将不得不自己寻找一个。

Shotcut 无疑是一款出色的视频编辑器。所以，应该是一个不错的选择。

微软 Teams 已删除

另一个重大变化是微软 Teams 不再包含在发行版中。

其原因是微软停止了 Linux 应用程序，转而支持一个渐进式 Web 应用程序版本。

我们之前的报道可以让你更深入地了解：


微软决定放弃 Teams 的 Linux 应用，代之以渐进式Web应用


更新的图标和新壁纸



Linux Lite 6.2 具有最新的 Papirus 图标集以及一系列新的 Linux Lite 主题壁纸。

这应该会给发行版带来用户可能喜欢的焕然一新的外观。

🛠️ 其他更改和改进



其他值得注意的变化包括：


任务管理器的更新

改进了 Lite 升级应用程序中的结束对话。

各种应用程序的最新更新、错误修复等。


你可以阅读完整的发行说明以 了解更多信息。

Linux Lite 6.2 看起来是对以前版本的令人满意的升级，有许多重大的变化和补充。

📥 下载 Linux Lite 6.2

你可以从其官方网站下载最新的 ISO 或使用 Lite 升级工具升级到它。

                              <span>近日，赛迪顾问软件与信息服务业研究中心通过广泛调研，编制完成了《中国服务器操作系统市场研究报告（2022H1）》（以下简称“报告”）。报告从市场规模、市场结构和市场特点三方面对 2022 年上半年中国服务器操作系统市场发展情况进行了分析，并从国内产业生态的角度切入，深入分析了现阶段 openEuler 生态的发展情况。当前，以 openEuler 为代表的中国开源社区正在构建以自主技术为核心的产业生态，国产服务器操作系统已经具备产品有开发者社区、有知识产权，高安全、高可用、可定制、可重构的特性。

此前，在工业和信息化部举行的“新时代工业和信息化发展”系列主题新闻发布会上，信息技术发展司相关负责人在答记者问时，表示：“支持成立国内首家开源基金会——开放原子开源基金会，加速孵化开放鸿蒙、欧拉等一批开源项目，推动开源代码托管平台发展，优化壮大开源社区，如欧拉开源社区用户数量超 60 万人，合作单位超 380 家。在服务器操作系统方面，推动服务器操作系统与主流 CPU、数据库、中间件等软硬件的兼容适配，加快提高产品国际竞争力。如，欧拉操作系统终端部署量超 170 万套。”肯定了当前时期国内操作系统产品和生态取得的成就。

报告选取了政府、运营商、金融、能源四大行业市场逐一分析，并对中国服务器操作系统未来的发展趋势进行了研判。赛迪顾问业务总监高丹在 2022 开放原子全球开源峰会 openEuler 分论坛上对报告内容和数据进行了发布和披露。

报告显示，从整体市场来看，2022 年上半年中国服务器操作系统装机量继续高速增长，较上年同期增长 11.7%，达 195.9 万套。



从 openEuler 生态来看，openEuler 系产品（社区版、商业发行版和企业自用版）市场继续保持高速发展态势，2022 年上半年 openEuler 系产品整体装机量达 67 万套，自欧拉开源社区成立（2019 年 12 月）以来，openEuler 系产品总装机量达 172 万套。可以说，openEuler 的全面开源，引发了中国服务器操作系统发展“质”的变化，推动者整个行业进入加速发展阶段。



同时，伴随产品在市场中的稳定表现，openEuler 系产品市场装机量在 2022 年继续突破，取得了多个领域的增速第一：在政府行业，openEuler 系产品在 2022 年上半年市场占有率达 39.2%，位居第一位；在运营商行业，市场占有率达 57.9%；在金融行业，装机量市场占有率达 28.0%，位居第二；在能源行业，市场份额进一步提升，占有率达 29.6%。

openEuler 还通过开源社区的建设，将芯片厂商、整机厂商、操作系统厂商、应用软件厂商等多类伙伴集合到社区中，社区成员实现共建、共享、共治，全球资源逐渐向社区汇聚，从而推动了整个产业链条的发展。同时，随着数字经济建设的不但推进，openEuler 着力建设数字基础设施的底座，通过不断与云计算、边缘计算等结合，提供对数字场景的支持。截至目前，openEuler 社区伙伴已超 380 家，全国下载量超 50 万，用户数量超 60 万人，PR（拉取请求（Pull Request））合入超 5.5 万。

从兼容性来看，openEuler 已完成与多个硬件厂商的兼容适配，通过了 CPU 架构（x86/ARM）、跨代 CPU、主板（USB/拓扑）、外设等房名的兼容性测试。



2019 年 openEuler 宣布开源，2021 年宣布全新升级，欧拉操作系统可覆盖从 IT、CT 到 OT 数字基础设施全场景，并于 2022 年推出首个数字基础设施全场景长周期版本。当前，大量的生态伙伴已经积极加入到 openEuler 开源社区的建设当中，欧拉真正实现了由企业主导向产业共建。未来，openEuler 社区将持续与全产业链伙伴一起，共建、共享、共治，打造全球首选的数字基础设施开源操作系统。</span>

瑞典时间 10 月 4 日上午，诺贝尔奖委员会宣布 2022 年诺贝尔物理学奖授予阿兰·阿斯佩克特 (Alain Aspect)、约翰·克劳瑟 (John F. Clauser) 和安东·泽林格 (Anton Zeilinger)，以表彰他们 「进行了纠缠光子的实验，确立了对贝尔不等式的不成立并开创了量子信息科学」。阿兰·阿斯佩克特、约翰·克劳瑟和安东·泽林格分别利用处于相互纠缠的量子态进行了突破性的实验。在这种情况下，两个粒子即使被分开也表现得如同一个整体。他们的成果为基于量子信息的新技术扫清了道路。
—— 摘自诺贝尔物理学奖官方新闻稿

说实话，在诺贝尔奖委员会正式宣布量子纠缠相关的成果获奖后，我立刻就意识到，互联网上很快就会充斥着各种针对量子纠缠以及量子世界的神秘性相关的科普。这些科普，无论是原创的还是东拼西凑的，无论是专家学者起草的还是各路内容流水线上生产的，都有一个共同的特征：它们往往都喜欢强化量子物理的神秘性和不可理解。
我承认，历史上确实有这么一段时间，即使是 20 世纪初期那些鼎鼎大名的物理学家，都曾为量子相关的物理现象感到困惑。然而，经过一百多年的发展，量子物理的诸多核心概念早就被一代又一代的物理学家里里外外地玩了个遍，以至于许多被科普作家渲染得神乎其神的概念，现正躺在物理系本科生的必修课教材里。
当然，量子力学有它反直觉的地方。但是，现实生活中反直觉的事情还少吗？反直觉并不意味着神秘或不可理解。它只是需要你屏蔽你的许多生活常识，用绝对的理性来思考问题。所以，这篇文章会和你读过的绝大部分科普不同，我不会把量子…</span>

                              <span>引言：用惯旗舰的我，为啥突然自购了一台入门DAP？

我承认，这个标题有点蹭过时热搜的标题党嫌疑；但作为一个有着五六年HiFi设备购买经验、分享却极其佛系的用户，收获不能说是经验丰富吧，至少也能说是白忙一场；自从三年以前第一次入手了旗舰级的KANN CUBE之后，为了追求“好马配好鞍”，在便携领域各种入手搭配的旗舰耳塞线材套装，洒出去的钱也有个五位数往上了。虽然标题上写着是对节奏坦克新款播放器V6的体验，但从某种程度上来说，这篇文章也算是玩了这么久的HiFi设备之后，一篇简单的自我回顾和反思文章。
在半个月前，我绝对不可能相信听惯了“旗舰级DAP”的自己会甘于使用一台中低端价位的播放器，即便中低端播放器近年来也的确出现过不少声音表现优秀、拉动价位甚至行业疯狂内卷的机器，但高端播放器毕竟有自己的能力与气场：作为品牌的旗舰，一般都有着最好的用料、最新的功能配置、最前沿的DAC芯片——著名的Astell&amp;Kern甚至没事就和上游的旭化成深度合作，三代SP系列几乎成为AKM全新旗舰DAC的首发平台；同时也倾注着品牌最优秀的音乐理解。
很显然，这些资源优势都是一般中低端播放器很难获得的，所以我现在依旧不怀疑“正经厂牌的高端播放器在综合素质表现上必然优于中低端产品”；以上观点也不代表我认为“所有人都必须和我一样不买个几万块东西就别想快乐听歌”，如果你的天桥9.9耳机已经让你非常快乐，那太好了，什么设备都理应有快乐听歌的权利。我开始怀疑的是，每天没事盯着见底的工资卡、紧了吧唧的盘算着怎么搭配耳机播放器，导致我个人的生活多了一堆需要计较的大小事，这些真的能让我听歌的过程变得更“快乐”吗？

因此这半个月的时间刚好给了我一个机会，你也可以认为这种机会比较祸福相依：我自购的SP1000在半个月前，因为某些极其离谱的外部非质量原因，不慎导致2.5mm接口损坏，被迫返厂维修。设备虽然要修，歌却不能…</span>

                              <span>痛点
想想看，平时在阅读上，你做了多少无用功？
勤勤恳恳阅读，认认真真做好高亮批注。你看到自己的思考结果与文章或者书中的文字融于一体，觉得特别安心。
然而，当你需要整理或者调用这些笔记的时候，才发现它们如同断线的珠子，散落在各种地方：
RSS 阅读内容在 feedspot 里； 微信公众号的高亮在 Instapaper 里；Epub 标记在 Marginnote 里；PDF 的高亮和批注在 LiquidText 里面…… 如果不加整理，它们就会在不同的应用中终老。
问题来了，该怎么整理这些散落的阅读笔记？
有的人并不觉得这是个棘手的事情。他们的作息时间，如同钟表一般规律。可以做到每天晚上专门花时间，雷打不动把这些内容整理出来，做好分类，放在 Evernote 或者 Obsidian 里。
但是，这种方法，对于懒人显然不友好。至少我自己，就笃定无法日复一日坚持下去。即便我希望能持续一周这样操作，恐怕都得专门雇个人在旁边监督自己。
幸好，技术的进步使我们不用活得那么悲摧。有一些工具可以帮助我们汇集各种资料，尤其是帮你保管阅读记录和高亮、批注。更好的消息，是这些工具有很多，例如 Readwise, Matter, Diigo, Cubox 和简悦（Simpread）等。
本文我就以自己常用的 Readwise 为例，为你介绍如何自动化汇集整理和利用笔记。希望这些经验也能够帮到你，早日摆脱手动整理阅读笔记的困扰。
Readwise

Lua is a scripting language used for procedural programming, functional programming, and even object-oriented programming. It uses a C-like syntax, but is dynamically typed, features automatic memory management and garbage collection, and runs by interpreting bytecode with a register-based virtual machine. This makes it a great language for beginners, but also a powerful tool for experienced programmers.

Apparently, the school had found my collection of children&#x27;s stories on the web. I spent a moment visualizing those students so far away, enjoying my stories on those printed pages of braille. The email&#x27;s sender might not have realized how meaningful their email was to me, but it&#x27;s stayed with me for two decades.

                              <span>iA Writer 是一款非常著名的，以简洁优美的界面和不错的使用体验著称的 Markdown 写作软件（虽然我没用过）。而最近，iA Writer 的开发商 iA.net 发布了一款名为 iA Presenter 的幻灯片制作软件，旨在通过简单的 Markdown 创作出精美的幻灯片。
市面上制作幻灯片的软件已经是数不胜数，除了常见的 PowerPoint、Keynote，还有基于 HTML5 技术的 Prezi、reveal.js、Canva 等，基于文档生成幻灯片的软件也有不少，比如双链笔记软件 Obsidian、文档工具语雀、飞书文档、石墨文档都有演示模式。
在这么多软件之中，iA Presenter 又有哪些优势，值得我们从繁杂的工作中抬起头来呢。
首先说明一下，目前 iA Presenter 还处于一个非常早期的阶段，文中提到的一些内容随时可能会因为软件的版本更新而发生变更。
另外，下文中会将 iA Presenter 简称为 iA Pre。
在此，也感谢 @南山居氪 提供的 iA Presenter 的邀请码。
PowerPoint 发生了什么
似乎现在很多软件都在以一种革命性的姿态来发布——认为自己的诞生能够颠覆一个行业，至少在发布时会伴随着一些阐述自己设计哲学的文章。Roam 和 Arc 是如此，iA Pre 也有些这样的味道。
iA 在其新闻页面上发了两篇文章，主要在说 PowerPoint 等传统幻灯片工具有什么问题，和 iA Pre 怎样使幻灯片更好？。
在第一篇文章1中，iA 认为，以 PPT 为代表的传统幻灯片工具有着入门难、耗时长、会让演讲者忘记他想说的东西、以及搭配 PPT 的演讲大多很无聊，这种无聊是我们的职业杀手以及事业杀手。
iA 怎样使幻灯片更好？
而在第二篇文章2中，iA 提出了他们认为的让演讲和幻灯片制作变得更好的方法：

Log data is one of the fastest-growing segments across data storage. It&#x27;s also one of the most complicated spaces. There are several products and solutions with overlapping use cases and confusing marketing.
This article looks at Parseable, a log storage and observability platform. Parseable is geared towards a better user experience, with an easy-to-deploy and use interface and a simple, cloud-native architecture. I&#x27;ll also show how to set up Parseable with FluentBit to store logs.

Sometimes you need to transfer files over a network. There are lots of file sharing services out there, but most require that you send your file to the Internet. This seems like a long way to go (not to mention the privacy concerns) when two computers are right beside each other, or at least in the same building. The open source WinSCP utility makes it quick and easy to transfer a file or a folder of files over the network from your Windows computer to your Linux computer.

                              <span>很多人会把人生比喻为游戏，因为都需要在既定的规则下，和他人同台竞争谋求最大胜利，读书时的升学排名，就业后岗位的激烈竞争，无一不是要决出个胜负，每个人都要追求赢。
但我们可能从来没有想过，除了参加有输赢的游戏，其实我们还可以选择另一种游戏——没有输赢，可以持续玩下去的游戏。
这便是《有限与无限的游戏》中的观点，它认为世界上至少有有限和无限两种游戏，有限游戏以获胜为目的，无限游戏以延续游戏为目的。
很神奇的是，我之前从《游戏改变世界》这本书中首次知晓该理论时，只是觉得有意思，但对我并没什么启发。

可是真的当我自己看完这本20万字的小书后，对我的影响却是立竿见影的。我读完隔天，在工作上和同事发生冲突时，脑子里一直在想着“不行，我不能像对方一样发火，我要玩的是无限游戏，争一时的输赢的玩不下去了”，因此就忍住了火气，最终也顺利解决了问题。
所以呢今天也为大家推荐这本书，看完后你一定会觉得，哇，原来有些竞争是根本没必要投入的，原来选择还可以有这么多，生活的改变从心态的改变开始，相信你也可以和我一样豁然开朗！
不过该书其实是本哲学书，理解和解读起来有一定难度，而且写法更偏意识流，作者没有特意去构建严密的框架和推理，甚至全书中作者自己都没有直接发表过「无限游戏更好」的结论，所以我会加入个人的理解去解读以便更好地介绍，但我也只是抛砖引玉，建议大家过后去看全书。
一、有限与无限游戏的基本概念
有限游戏有三个显著特征。

它是以取胜为目的，一旦决出胜负则游戏结束，所以称之为有限游戏，注意这里的胜负必须是所有参与者认同，而不是裁判或观众认同。
参与者只能在游戏界限内进行游戏。
有限游戏的规则一经所有参与者认同就生效，且不能改变，否则就是另一个游戏了。

怎么样，听起来是不是很熟悉，几乎跟我们从小到大遇到的竞争一个模式。而无限游戏则恰好是跟它反着来的，它也有三个相对的显特征。

它并非以取胜为目的…</span>

Halloween will be here before you know it! This fun, over-the-top holiday is a great time to ponder the mortal fears of the developer in each of us. What haunts you the most, in the quiet moments just before your code starts to run?
Getting into the spirit of Halloween, I asked some Opensource.com writers: What&#x27;s the scariest code you&#x27;ve seen or written?

Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you needed to do a code review but didn&#x27;t fully understand the project? Maybe you did not review it to avoid looking like you didn&#x27;t know what you were doing.
This article assures you that there&#x27;s a better way. You don&#x27;t need to know everything to provide a code review. In fact, based on my experience, that&#x27;s quite common.
I remember when I joined Red Hat as an intern and was asked to help with code reviews. We used a system of +1 or -1 votes, and I was initially very hesitant to weigh in. I found myself asking whether when I gave a +1 on a change but then someone else voted -1, would I look foolish?

上几篇专栏介绍了绿色系、蓝色系，自然少不了光学三原色的另一名成员——红色。这一期来讲讲红色系键帽，方便各位键友选购搭配自己的梦中情键。

GMK Red Samurai 红武士
R1 2018.2 R2 2020
BASE
这套键帽是由设计师Redsun（红太阳）设计而成，同时他也是GMK蓝武士的设计师，gmk四大武士中的两款由他设计。关于这套键帽的灵感来源有两个版本。
在R1的IC中。

作者表示灵感来自于火影忍者中宇智波斑的铠甲颜色

而在R2中

作者则表示灵感来源于井伊直政（日本历史角色）
关于作者灵感来源，我还是更加倾向于R1中的说法，而为何要改口，可能是为了规避版权问题，但我个人觉得，在红武士中其实并不能看出过多来自于漫画中的角色要素，并且忍者和武士也是两种职业，作者关于忍者和武士的定义，好像也并没有非常清晰。
配色：

暗黄、深红、灰黑，低调而不失深度的配色，黑红相间配以金色点缀，经典耐看。
个性部分：

这一套的个性数量和种类都非常丰富“忍”“侍”，其实这一套键帽虽然称之为武士，但里面也融合了非常多忍者的元素，在武器类型中“飞镰”、“团扇”、“手里剑”、“苦无”，都是非常常见的忍者标志性武器，还有一些不明所以的图案。
其实这位作者在R1中的早期个性设计，是带有浓烈火影忍者特色的。
早期个性设计
穿着盔甲的天狗，很显然是宇智波斑的须佐能乎，以及极其明显的神威万花筒写轮眼图案。
但在最终敲定版本中为了规避版权问题进行了大刀阔斧的修改，最终便呈现出一个极具忍者风味的武士主题键帽。

搭配建议：
深色无疑是合适的，这套键帽很是百搭，红色、蓝色、黄色，都能驾驭，我个人最喜欢灰色和黑色进行搭配，红色也是很不错的，但过于鲜亮的颜色搭配起来难度还是…</span>

                              <span>相信大部份人用的都是拼音輸入法。
學會一個非拼音的中文輸入法，是一件好玩的事，這是一項實用的技能，能證明你的智商和學習能力。
以後搞博客，工作，寫作，成為作家，跟人聊天，等等很多地方都能用上。
其實很多人對「形碼」還存在誤解。

誤解一，除了拼音就是五筆。
其實形碼是一衆不以拼音而是字形部件組合來輸入中文的方法。著名的有：倉頡、鄭碼、五筆，等等。
其中五筆是最有名，但又是最難學最難用的。
誤解二，形碼一定比拼音快。
其實形碼並不一定比拼音快，比如我用倉頡打「哈哈哈哈」，我輸入的是「romr romr romr romr 」，而拼音只需要輸入「hhhh 」。
也就是說，在某些特定場合，拼音，簡拼，比形碼還要快。
那形碼的優點是甚麼？形碼不是快，而是準。形碼人的思維是，如果連準確輸入都做不到，那快有甚麼用？
誤解三，五筆（形碼）很難，要背很多字根。
其實是因為五筆的字根太多太難背，才會給人這樣的感受。我用過五筆兩年，我也承認背字根是一個非常高的門檻。
但是，並不是所有形碼都跟五筆一樣難背。倉頡輸入法的字元就比五筆少很多，好記很多，記下根本不費吹灰之力。
誤解四，學個輸入法要浪費很多時間，學會了也沒甚麼用。
這是極其錯誤的想法。中文打字，不管到哪裏，都是實用的技能。現在網上到處都是同音錯字，比如「再在」不分，就是因為拼音輸入法根本打不準。那麼如果你跟別人文字聊天時，或者發表文章時，能做到用字準確，那不就是一個加分項嗎？
因此，花費一點時間，去學一個形碼，是事半功倍的事。一個好的中文輸入法，是可以用一輩子的。而你只需要用掉幾日的時間來學習。

先寫到這裏。我是中文輸入法專家尹卂，目前在用倉頡。有甚麼問題可以在下方留言。</span>

满打满算，我加入键盘爱好者圈子已经超过三年了。我感觉自己非常有幸，能亲身经历键盘圈子三年间的种种改变。这篇文章，我将结合自己的尝试过的产品、感受到的变化，给大家总结下三年间键盘风向的快速变化，以及展望下未来。
2019 年，热插拔结构萌芽
在 2019 年，客制化键盘圈子当中，热插拔结构逐渐普及开来。
那个时候我是一个很普通的键盘小白。只想要一个高端机械键盘，来满足我一个手游程序员的日常工作需求。而客制化键盘需要买家亲自去组装键盘的所有零部件。而安装轴体对于彻彻底底的小白来说，就是一个非常巨大的门槛。
在当时安装轴体的方法有两种，一种就是传统的焊接，需要用户学习焊接的基础知识，需要购买焊台，焊锡，学习焊接轴体的操作技巧。如果操作不当，还有可能把键盘电路板烧毁、损毁轴体。由于客制化键盘都是采用团购的形式，制作工期极长，所有的零件都是根据购买量定制的，电路板有个三长两短，再找一块电路板来，就不是那么容易的事情了。焊接完成之后，想要更换轴体，更是一件麻烦事，需要重新拆解键盘，学习使用吸锡器。
键盘带有热插拔结构之后，只需要在安装之前，掌握轴体的安装方向，轻轻一按，轴体就安装完成了。可以说是小白新手的福音，能极大的降低客制化键盘圈子的入圈门槛。而在当时，愿意增加热插拔结构的客制化键盘却非常少。
造成这一现象的原因可以分成两方面看待：
一是客观原因。在当时，客制化键盘的生产线没有现今那么强大。零件需要外包出去制作。负责生产的工厂水平参差不齐，最终生产的成品，出现划痕、刀痕、色差也是时有发生。最严重的情况就是外包的工厂心术不正，直接卷钱跑路。…</span>

@王百顺BS：Nutale Air Pro - Airtag下位替代品

入手渠道：淘宝
入手价格：192 元

新发布的 AirPods Pro 内置了 Airtag 又让我重新对这个去年发布的小东西提起了兴趣，恰好看到 Nutale Air Pro 打折，四个套装比单个 Airtag 还便宜，就想试试能不能作为平替。
先放两张外观的图片：
正面：金属边框，两面塑料，有一颗按键，一个发声的开槽（按键手感很差软塌塌的没有反馈）背面：有个放纽扣电池的盖子，用手一推就能打开，一颗 CR2032 纽扣电池
几天试用下来体验还不错，有「Works with Apple Find My」的认证所以可以直接在「查找」app 中的「物品」这一栏添加设备，所有的操作也都是在「查找」app 中，和查看其他 Apple 的设备操作一样。
在查找 app 中的界面，这个两个物品都是
价格便宜自然会有一些缺失的功能，比如：精确查找。 就是到达 Airtag 附近（大概 20 米以内吧）之后触发精确查找，告诉你在什么方向还有多远。 这个功能在 Nutale Air Pro 上是没有的（据说是因为 Apple 还没有开放 UWB 所以市面上还没有第三方的产品具备精确查找），你只能到达附近之后通过播放声音来寻找，声音大小用 Apple Watch 粗略测试了一下可以达到 95 分贝，装到帆布包里间隔两米声音大概 60 分贝，装在包里隔一堵墙距离大概 7 米就需要仔细听了。
精确查找：图片来自 Apple 官网截图

                              <span>前言
2022年10月24日，特斯拉官宣降价，基础版本model 3降价1.4万，model y降价2.8万，可以说是非常大的降价幅度，结合2022款整体上更新的车机芯片加上扩大的电池容量，一部分车款可以说是重回性价比车型的行列。
我们讲电车使用成本低，是基于有家用充电桩的环境，如果都用特斯拉超充，不算停车费，每公里电费都能到3毛以上，而使用谷时电家充，每公里电费可以控制在5分钱。但家充桩需要有固定车位，还要向电网申请电表，以及需要物业允许施工的证明，这些硬性条件也劝退着一些潜在车主。
而除了固定的家用充电桩，还有便携充电器，也就是随车充可以作为新能源车的补能方案。随车充在使用上可以使用家庭插座，支持自带线缆从家中接到室外充电，不需要独立电表，对于公司有插座、农村有自建房以及低楼层居民楼住户都比较友好。
本篇选择了四款随车充，覆盖了品牌、设计特点、功率支持的几个不同方向，来详细对比产品设计和具体功能，希望能为随车充的选择答疑解惑。
缆上控制与保护装置（IC-CDP)

其实随车充产品我分析过很多次，它本质上就是从电源到新能源车电机的连接装置，换言之就是一根电源线，电能转化为电池电量都是在新能源车内部完成的。而对于随车充产品消费首先需要重点关注的就是是否配备了缆上控制与保护装置，缩写为IC-CDP。
在国家标准GB/T 18487.1-2015《电动汽车传导充电系统 第一部分:通用要求》中，将就是一根电缆连接电动汽车和交流电网的随车充称为模式1产品；将电缆上加入IC-CDP的随车充产品称为模式2产品。前者可以为车充电，根据电缆长度不同售价在200元上下，但模式1产品缺乏保护功能和控制功能，便宜但抗风险能力基本为0。后者模式2则是大部分车主的核心选择，通过控制盒可以实现各种差异化功能，特斯拉、比亚迪的原厂随车充我们称为车规产品，都是模式2随车充。
对于我们私家车主而言，充电安全…</span>

2022 年，对我来说是不平凡的一年，键圈的兴亡成败在这一年格外明显。也是这一年我开始从一个消费者转变成一个创作者，遇到了更多的人，也想了了更多过去不会思考的问题。下面来讲讲我这一年的所思所想和所感，以及今后的一些打算。虽然都是些浅短的认识，但是分享出来也算是一种体验，非常感谢大家的观看和意见。欢迎评论区友好讨论。
键盘圈的大趋势
现代社会人与人的交流不再局限于过去话语和书信的形式，而更多倾向于快捷的网络输入交流。快捷频繁的信息互通使得输入工具成为生活工作长时间高频率接触的日常用品。2020 年的疫情提早将线上办公大规模地带入人们的生活之中，人们也重新开始审视自己的办公桌搭，机械键盘市场在疫情之下，不降反增。
机械键盘热度上涨这件事，无论是从日常生活中关于机械键盘话题讨论度愈发增高，还是从近些年来机械键盘品牌数急剧增加都可以得到一定程度的论证。
数据来源：什么值得买
近些年来，在机械键盘领域我能明显感知到的就是选择越来越多了，无论是量产还是客制化，无论是轴体、键帽、套件。国内机械键盘在「物质」水平上，毫无疑问的成长了。
在轴体领域，国产轴体自 2010-2012 开始萌芽，在 2019 年这个关键节点打出了名声，国内轴体市场也从 Cherry 的独角戏演变成现在的百家争鸣。
佳达隆的产品时间线 2012—2020
在键帽领域，过去的客制化玩家大多只能选择 GMK、SP 等海外品牌，如今有国产老牌客制化键帽 JTK、2019 年出现的 Domikey 和 2022 年入场的 PBTfans 以及各种各样的键帽代工厂，包括量产领域也出…</span>

                              <span>最近我在抽屉里翻出来一台尘封已久的 iPhone 5s，它刚刚在 20 年才从我手中退役，一眨眼它就快发布十年了。在用它的时候我其实对手机了解很少，也不懂摄影，就只是拿来刷网页。于是趁着这个由头，重头开始了解一下 iPhone 的一些变化。首先想写的是 iPhone 相机的一些内容，暂时先写单摄时代的 13 款机型。照例先给出我全文的脉络，供各位参考。

iPhone + iPhone OS 1 / iPhone 3G + iPhone OS 2
2007 年 1 月 9 日，乔布斯在初代 iPhone 的发布会上只用了一句话介绍其搭载的相机

看后面，最显眼的就是内置的 2 百万像素摄像头。
iPhone 发布会
 
关于相机方面大量的篇幅其实是在介绍照片软件，搭配 3.5 寸的可触摸屏幕，可以向左滑动或向右滑动查看照片，捏合放大缩小，横置手机的同时照片也跟着变换方向等。

第三个我想要展示给大家看的手机功能是照片。你知道的，我之前说过，在iPhone里内置有一台二百万像素的相机，我们也有着最酷的照片管理软件，它在移动设备中是最好的。但是我认为它在所有的平台中也都堪称最棒。这是我们的照片，我正在进入照片库，这就是照片库，在这里我可以用我的手指来滑动浏览照片，相当酷。让我们看看相册，我要选择意大利，让我们从第一张开始，我可以通过滑动手机来浏览这些照片。我可以翻看照片库，大家看这是一张风景照片，现在我调转了我的手机方向，然后它就变成了这个样子，酷吗？怎么样？当我在看这张风景照片的时候我也可以滑动它。怎么样？是不是看上去还不错？我还可以把一些照片放大，我能用我的手指来对它进行缩放。我可以让手指分开来让图片变大，酷不酷？我还能移动照片，怎么样，酷吗？还可以把照片设置为手机壁纸，这样就能设置成为壁纸。当我回到主页，然后锁屏，当我解锁之后，我设…</span>

                              <span>之前，我在《论文读不懂怎么办？》一文中，给你介绍了论文阅读遇到问题时的几个解决方法。尤其是介绍了你可以求助的免费资源和路径，它们包括但不限于：

幻灯
博客
视频
课程
代码

那篇文章，在知乎上获得了 2600 个赞（截止 2022 年 10 月）。我相信，对于很多同学，起到了帮助。

只不过，环境和技术在变化，我们解决问题的方法和思路，也应该与时俱进。
这不，因为有了大规模自然语言处理模型的加持，阅读论文时遇到不认识的名词，或者无法理解作者的简单解释时，我们有了一种新的对策。
具体的方法，就是人工智能替你阅读后，把内容综合整理，结合上下文转换成简单清晰的语言，再反馈给你。
这个想法，其实并不新鲜了。翻看近几年自然语言处理领域的论文，你能看见不少相关的研究。
只不过，那些研究成果只存在论文中，或者是在某个实验室的电脑里面，普通人根本无法接触，更不要说利用了。
这回可不一样，有人（ \@amanjha__ and \@functionofjade）居然真的就做了个产品出来。
这个应用的名字，叫做 explainpaper ，非常直白吧？

使用起来也特别方便。不用去菜单里面点选找寻。只要你把论文传上去，高亮某一个词语、短语或者段落，人工智能就会自动为你解读。

不仅如此，你还可以就着 AI 反馈的结果，继续追问。
这种应用演示不大适合图文。所以我干脆为你做了 一段演示视频，你可以先看看。
 
 
看完之后，感受如何？
反正不少小伙伴表示，很兴奋。

这东西背后的技术是啥？当然还是咱们的老熟人 ------GPT-3.
其实 GPT-3 这模型的特点，说穿了就是大。因为模型庞大，参数众多，所以从海量语料库里积攒的「认知」就多。注意我这里刻意回避了「知识」这个词儿。

（资料来源：t.ly/cY1kn）
从上图中，你不难看到，现在的文本和代码生成中，GPT-3 都占据了重要位置。
我喜欢共享内容的原因之一，是视频发出后总可以获得观众进一步的反馈。不少的问题，都会激发我的思考。
例如有小伙伴在视频后面提问，说这个东西能不能帮着理解中文论文啊？

这是个很好的问题。毕竟很多国内人文社科研究生平时阅读的论文，更大比例是中文的。
我一开始觉得这个问题问得有些太贪心了。对于一个外国人做的刚上线应用，你指望人家立即支持阅读中文，还能看懂中文的研究论文，不大现实吧？
刚要回复，我突然想起来 上次在 Lex 上面的教训了。既然 explainpaper 的底层模型是 GPT-3 ，那它本来就该认得中文啊。
为了确保回答准确，还是实际测试一下吧。我传了一篇自己的论文上去。

中文划线高亮之后，AI 反馈的结果让我有些吃惊。
尽管 explainpaper 并不能直接用中文来解释信息。但它可以立即识别出「知识管理」就是 knowledge management ，然后进一步解释下去。
下面这段解释，就更有意思了。

它先广泛解释「插件」是啥，然后结合本文的上下文，指出 Roam Toolkit 是一种插件，并且描述了它的功能。
不仅如此，从下图可以看出，就连划线的时候字符之间出现了空格间隔，也依然能正常识别和解释。

下面，我故意找了个文中没有进行详细解释的「概念网络」，结果是这样的。

我能确定，这解释里面出现的「宠物」、「猫」、「狗」啥的，肯定没在本文正文出现过。
Evernote 这一段，让我愣住了。

Explainpaper 居然是准确识别了这张表格，并且把内容总结梳理，然后用英文输出了出来。
上述的演示，是不是回答了读者的问题呢？我觉得算不上。从需求分析来看，人家看中文论文遇到术语不清楚，自然是需要中文的解释。你再弄成英文给我，这......
可换个角度想想，这东西帮助外国人阅读中文论文，可是再好不过了。遇到中文专业词汇，随时可以获得准确的英文解释，而且阐述还贴合论文的上下文。外国人读中文论文，将减少很多障碍。这或许可以快速提升中文论文的影响力，妙啊！
另外，目前 explainpaper 缺乏中文解释能力，也给国内的开发者提供了发展空间。希望早日看到更多 AI 实际应用上线，帮助国人理解中文论文。
我期待你能自己尝试一下这款在线应用。至少在目前，它是免费的。而且因为上传的都是公开发表的论文，也不存在用户隐私泄漏问题。所以可以放心大胆地尝试 ------ 特别是对于最近要写文献综述的小伙伴来说。
欢迎你把自己测试的结果和经验心得，分享在留言区。咱们一起交流讨论。
祝论文阅读愉快！

                              <span>伴随 iOS 16.1 的发布，YaoYao 也适配了 iOS 16.1 相关功能
 
 
灵动岛
当你在手表上开始运动后，再打开手机App，你将发现YaoYao 的灵动岛功能。
灵动岛在 iPhone 14 Pro 上可以使用，你可以把灵动岛理解成一个indicator。

具体有多大用，实际我也没太明白，再就是要看这个功能提供后，各路厂商的想象力，以我自己的判断，Apple 可能也没太明白，这个应该会在后面继续迭代。
实时活动（Live Activity）
这个实时活动和灵动岛是一起的，绑定的，这也是我不太能理解的地方。它不需要iPhone 14 Pro，其他手机也会显示，你可以把它理解成一个特殊的通知.
它能实时显示新跳绳的运动数据，在 iPhone 14 Pro常亮屏的加持下更加好用，个人认为常亮屏是 iPhone 14 Pro 最大的亮点，就像 Apple Watch 自从有了常亮显示，体验大大提高一样。
Live Activity
Apple Watch Ultra 操作按钮（Action Button)
为了适配 Apple Watch Ultra 这个特殊的自定义键（Action Button，手表左侧这个黄色键），我特意买了一个 Ultra，现在在系统里配置该键后，你就可以：
 
 
1. 一键启动YaoYao
2. 按下该键暂停运动
3. 再按下恢复运动（或和右边的侧边键同时按下）
因为不用看屏幕可以直接按，减少了心智负担，实际使用非常好用！变成了我最喜欢 Ultra的功能。之前感觉佳明表全是按键操作，不能触控，拿到手完全不会用，感觉很傻，看来也有一定道理，哈哈。

请将App 更新到最新版，尝鲜以上功能。

                              <span>引言
iPad中关于键盘的设置与鼠标一样 —— 非常混乱。例如，iPad键盘的设置也是出现在「通用 | 键盘」、「辅助功能 | 键盘」以及「辅助功能 | 触控 — 辅助触控」中。
其中，「辅助功能 | 触控 — 辅助触控」其实就是上一篇文章中的「鼠标键」，具体可以参考《鼠标搭配 iPadOS，如何设置才能更好用？》
「通用 | 键盘 — 实体键盘」
键位调节
在实体键盘中，你可以根据iPad已有的输入法进行键位调节。例如我们常用的是QWERTY键盘，而你可以在这里改成AZERTY等。

 
下面的几项设置中，大家基本都能理解，而且也无关痛痒。笔者认为比较重要的是下面两个：
按下🌐显示表情符号
首先，这个🌐符号在妙控键盘里就是左下角的fn。
显示表情符号这个按钮，比较适合常用emoji😄的场景。例如‼️，一般写小🍠的朋友都需要用较多的emoji来分1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣等小标题，那么打开这个功能就会非常方便啦✨。
实际上，就算打开了这个功能，也不会影响我们切换输入法，因为使用control+空格也能轻松切换输入法，与我们使用Mac的习惯一样。

使用大写锁定键切换语言
第二个功能也是Mac中特有的功能。从Windows换到Mac的用户很不爽的一点是：想按Caplock键来输入大写字母，结果只能切换输入法，非得长按才行。
实际上这个功能是可以开关的，iPad上也一样。打开后，我们可以自由地在当前输入法和英文输入法之间切换（如果当前是简体中文输入法，那么就是中——英；如果是俄语输入法，那么便是俄——英），如果在键盘语言中把英文输入法删除的话，这个功能即使打开也不能使用了。关闭后，我们按下Caplock键就能切换为全大写输入。macOS中也一样，删除自带的中文输入法（英文输入法不能删除），就不能实现这个功能。

「辅助功能 | 键盘」

辅助功能中的键盘设置分为两个部分，一个是…</span>

                              <span>你好，我是马上要上第 700 节 CrossFit 团课的克莱尔。（但今天是我的休息日。所以我来写稿了。
如果你想减脂增肌，或者厌倦了在普通健身房对着满屋子器械不知从何下手，CrossFit 训练也许是一个最简单粗暴的健身方案。

融合有氧器械、哑铃壶铃、药球、奥林匹克举重与单杠和吊环体操动作， CrossFit 以社区感、团课、每天不重样的训练内容闻名。对，我们每天练的项目都不一样，它要求你什么都懂（一点），对心肺、力量、柔韧性等各方面都有要求。
换句话说， CrossFit 花样丰富，有趣，强度大，但作为一个相对小众的运动，准入门槛也不低。如果你在一二线城市，找到好馆子的可能性会比较大。如果你经常出差—— CrossFit 就像健身界的星巴克，无论到哪个城市，都能找到以相似模式运行的 Box ，能结识不同的朋友。
全球 CF 馆分布
今年是我练 CF 的第三年。根据三年的观察，许多来 CF 新客体验的人常被这项运动的强度或者“对新人不友好”震慑，觉得这是一馆子又壮又爱拼命的疯子。但其实 CF 并没有想象中这么吓人。在进行你的第一次 CF 训练之前，提前知道这些事情可以降低你在馆里低血糖、呕吐或者被吓得从此听到 CF 就绕道走的概率。
离你最近的 CrossFit 训练馆在哪里？
首先，如何找到离你最近的 CF 训练馆？如果你在国内一线城市，在点评 app 里输入 CrossFit 就是最快的方法，如果搜索结果中出现【综合训练】字样，它很有可能也是一个 CF 馆。只是未经 CF 官方认证。这不代表它是山寨——近几年有越来越多场馆认为自己不需要每年缴会费做这个认证，但大家训练的系统是一样的。
如果你在国外，除了谷歌，另一个方法是点进 crossfit.com 网页，在右上角 Find a gym 这里找到经过官方认证的场馆（对国内场馆同样适用，但也许网速会众所周知地慢一点）…</span>

这个标题其实已经被我修改了一下，因为一边上学一边写稿偶尔真的拖延爆炸。在这之前，其实标题是：“灵动岛到底好不好”。如今我也算是吃了豹子胆，敢直接标题下结论。虽然已经离发布会过了很多天，当时的情绪也已经逐渐稀释，还是想尽可能理性的去一点点解释，为什么不好。
我并不想在文章的一开头就给自己贴上标签，一方面是不喜欢这样的做法，另一方面也是此时的我并没有什么拿得出手的名堂。很多观点都是超级主观的，但也很高兴你能来看看！谢谢你，我的朋友！希望你看的开心！

“好不好”的尺度
对于灵动岛，我感觉我们都有着一样的一条曲折心路：发布会前被剧透难看的感叹号挖孔，发布会时被灵动岛的亮相视频惊艳到再次对苹果重拾希望，但第二天起床琢磨过劲——这也是我们出现分歧的地方：我们都想知道这究竟是另一个 Touch Bar，还是一个能定义 iPhone 接下来几年发展的新设计。
要想搞清楚这个问题，我想讲个有些偏题的故事。
来到伦敦后，一个人住一个只有17平米的房子，空虚寂寞冷的时候也会想用音乐填满自己的房间。于是就在亚马逊上看了看各种音箱。我目前使用的电脑是14寸的 MacBook Pro，但长期会连着一个明基的显示器来用，所以我对这个音箱购买就列下了几条条件：

音质不能比 mac 本身差
必须有 aux，这样我能连接显示器用，受不了蓝牙的音画不同步
能放在显示器的正下方，所以不能太大
好看，别太贵…

在网上看了一圈，我特别喜欢 Marshall 的 EMBERTON II，当时加上一点学生优惠不到100英镑就能拿下。我觉得它小巧精致，光是凭借这好看的皮囊我就快按耐不住自己的购买欲了。可是它却有一个地方不能满足我的需求，它没有 aux，纯蓝牙。当时我的内心就出现了两股力量：一股力量准备 pua 自己，让自己接受蓝牙的延迟；另一股力量开始嘲讽 Marshall 这个品牌的一些关于“音质”和“品…</span>

实话实说，最近软件圈的「玩具」有点儿多。
笔记软件，有 Tana；浏览器，有 Arc；Readwise 新出的一站式阅读器 Reader ，也很不错。
没想到，我又在 Jarod 的知识星球里看到他推荐了一款在线编辑器：LEX。
要来了一个邀请链接后，原本我是打算先留着，有空再仔细尝试。但是，一进入 LEX 的界面，读了官方的介绍，我立刻就不淡定了。

其实，哪里只是我一个人不淡定啊？
Building the Second Brain 作者 Tiago Forte 说，自己已经看到要失业的迹象了。原来，在他用 LEX 试写的一篇文章里，他自己只写了 5 个词儿。
剩下全是 AI 顺着往下编。

至于效率类 YouTube 播主 Ali Abdaal 更是「恶作剧」：他用 LEX 创作了一篇「15 个效率技巧」，拆成一串推文发了出来，结果成了自己反响最热烈的推文。（事后他向大家公开了内容来源。）

当然，Ali 是名人，浏览量是有名人效应的。即使如此，人工智能的作品几乎骗过了所有人的眼睛，还收获了这么多的点赞和转发，这就厉害了。
下面说说我自己的实际测试结果吧。下图中，只有红框里面的文字，是我写的。然后后面的段落，全都是 LEX 自动补全的。

更厉害的是，根据这些内容，LEX 自动生成了若干标题，我只是从中选了一个而已。
