Almost a year after Huawei announced its first clamshell foldable in the form of the P50 Pocket, it’s back with a followup. The new device is called the Huawei Pocket S, and it maintains the same foldable form-factor as the P50 with circular notification display and camera bumps on its outside. But the new phone comes with one fewer external cameras, a lower-end processor, and a lower starting price of ¥5,988 (around $818) versus ¥8,988 (around $1,228) for the P50 Pocket. 
That price means the Pocket S neatly undercuts its main foldable clamshell competitor, Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip 4 (which was priced at around ¥7,499, or $1,025, in China, according to Gizmochina). But continuing US sanctions against Huawei mean the Pocket S faces...

Patreon is officially launching its own video hosting feature, nearly a year after it was first teased.
The update marks a major shift in how creators on Patreon can share video content with fans. Previously, creators had to upload videos to third-party platforms like YouTube and Vimeo and then embed video players or share links with subscribers. Uploading to a third-party app had its wrinkles, however, like videos being shared outside of paying subscribers.
The native and ad-free Patreon player allows creators to upload their content directly to the platform, select thumbnails for their videos, and view audience data like view count. Creators will also be able to select who can view the video without worrying whether links will be...

Aqara just lifted the veil on its smart home roadmap at the Matter launch event in Amsterdam. It starts with a free software update in December for the Hub M2 to make many of Aqara’s existing Zigbee devices Matter compatible. That will be followed by the release of Aqara’s first two Matter-over-Thread devices in early 2023 and a new multi-protocol hub coming sometime in the future.
Starting in December, the maker of low-cost smart home devices will issue an over-the-air update to the Aqara Hub M2 to make over 40 of Aqara’s existing Zigbee devices Matter compatible when attached to the hub. That list will eventually expand to support more than 160 of the company’s Zigbee devices. Aqara’s other hubs, including the Hub M1S/M1S Gen 2, Hub...

Meta is rolling out a few changes to WhatsApp that will make the app better to use for large circles of people, including the wide rollout of Communities.
Communities are designed to house multiple related groups within bigger organizations of people, such as a neighborhood or a workplace. Think something like Slack or Discord, but with a WhatsApp spin (including end-to-end encrypted messages), and admins can share updates with an entire community through an announcements channel. The company first began testing Communities out in April, and now they’re rolling out to everyone.

Twitter employees have been bracing for layoffs since Elon Musk officially took over the company, and details are starting to trickle out about how many people could be affected. Wednesday evening, The Verge’s Alex Heath reports that Musk is meeting with advisors, including fellow former PayPal exec David Sacks, and finalizing a plan to lay off approximately 3,800 employees, while Bloomberg reported that 3,700 would be cut.
According to Bloomberg, the plan is for employees to be informed about the layoffs on Friday, and affected workers could be given 60 days of severance pay. Musk is also planning to end Twitter’s policy that allowed employees to work from home “forever,” Bloomberg reports. This would line up with text messages we’ve...

Meta has announced that it’s testing minting and selling NFTs on Instagram, like you can with many traditional NFT marketplaces, with a “small group of creators in the US” getting access to the feature first. The company’s also expanding Instagram’s NFT showcase feature, which it recently made available to users in over 100 countries. The announcement comes among news of several new ways for creators to make money on its platforms.
Meta says its digital collectibles toolkit will let people create NFTs on the Polygon blockchain (as always, no relation to Polygon the video game news outlet) and then sell them either on Instagram or off the platform. When it comes to displaying NFTs that you’ve purchased elsewhere, the company says you can...

Twitter’s edit feature only turned from myth to something people could actually use in October, but it might be available to everyone very soon. In what might be one of the first big product changes under Elon Musk’s Twitter regime, the company will be opening up the edit feature to all users as early as this week, according to Bloomberg.
Currently, tweet editing is locked behind the company’s soon-to-change $4.99 Twitter Blue subscription that’s only available for users in a few countries, and Twitter has stressed that the edit feature is technically still in testing. Musk seems to think it’s ready for everyone and is also planning a big overhaul of Twitter Blue that could be rolled out in the coming days.

The most recent versions of the MongoDB server can be downloaded as binary archives from mongodb.com or installed using standard packaging techniques.
A robust GUI for searching, aggregating, and visualising your MongoDB data is available from MongoDB and is called MongoDB Compass.

                              <span>We can use Lambda@Edge functions to authorize requests that come to our CloudFront distribution. This way, the request won&#x27;t proceed to the origin if it doesn&#x27;t contain the required headers.
Assume that our application wants to receive near-real-time notifications from a 3rd party provider. We are setting up a webhook where the partner can send the events.
Lambda function URLs are a great choice for this purpose. They are easy to set up, and an API Gateway - although it&#x27;s a proper solution - would probably be overkill here.
One drawback of Lambda function URLs is that they don&#x27;t allow custom domains as of writing this. A workaround to this issue is to create a CloudFront distribution where the origin is the function URL. We can then add the distribution as a target for the Route 53 record.…</span>

                              <span>You most probably won’t get surprised if we tell you that in recent years, the internet and its impact have grown tremendously. This can be attributed to the growth of the technologies that help create more user-friendly applications. Moreover, there is more and more automation at every step – from the development to the testing of web applications. 
Having good tools to test web applications is crucial. Libraries such as Playwright help speed up processes by opening the web application in a browser and other user interactions such as clicking elements, typing text, and, of course, extracting public data from the web.
In this post, we’ll explain everything you need to know about Playwright and how it can be used for automation and even web scraping.

                              <span>A big part of Kubernetes is the networking capabilities, we get the option to internally route traffic to neighbouring pods, split workloads on multiple nodes and even open up networking to the outside world.
Let&#x27;s take a closer look at some of the elements conform networking.
The first thing to note is that Kubernetes networking happens on a DNS level, every pod in a cluster receives it&#x27;s own cluster wide unique IP address.
There are a lot of benefits of doing it this way, mainly because the pods get randomly refreshed, and luckily for us Kubernetes can keep perfect track of this.
A big part of networking in Kubernetes is services, which are a abstract way to expose an application running on a set of pods. Kubernetes under the hood will assign unique IP addresses to each of them, but make…</span>

Will start by doing an over view of what are background jobs
They are tasks that runs in the background without any user interventions which help the application to run smoothly.
Some of the examples of the background 
for long and lengthy operations like data processing .
Batch import from APIs, files …
Synchronisation functionalities
Reporting functionalities.
Notification services.
Hangfire is open-source and used to schedule background jobs at a particular event and time.

As you can see from the image above, the backend is made of a Route53 Record A that points to my custom domain.

                              <span>Hello coders! 
This article presents an open-source mini eCommerce solution powered by Stripe and Django on top of an open-source kit styled with Bootstrap 5. The UI has been improved to support fast editing of any product defined in Stripe (information, pricing, and also images). Being released on GitHub the sources can be incorporated into commercial projects or simply used in eLearning activities. Thanks for reading!
👉 Django &amp; Stripe eCommerce - source code
👉 Free Support via Github (issues tracker) and Discord.
Another useful feature of this project is the Bootstrap 5 design, provided by Creative-Tim. Soft UI Design, the UI Kit used to style the pages, comes with 50+ components and reusable widgets for at least a decent eCommerce project.








  
  
  How it works


To fully use the features of this starter, we need a Stripe account with a few products defined, and no more than 5 minutes to follow up the steps presented in the video:
✅ Download or fork the product
✅ Install the dependencies
✅ Migrate the database and create a superuser
✅ Save Stripe secrets in env file
✅ Start the app &amp; Authenticate as a superuser
✅ Import the products and edit the local information
Being visual, the above steps should not take a long time, even for programming beginners. The left panel shows the Stripe products and the right panel is dedicated to local products.  
Editable fields for each product: name, description, short information and images.
For each image, the user can provide external links or local images saved by the Django backend. 

Once a product is created, the user can visualize the generated page, edit the information and delete the product (requires confirmation).

I fundamentally want to write applications in a different way then most of the file-based-routing meta-frameworks do. I want write small ui components with server actions and server loaded data all to be defined in one file, and have the ability to load that file in as a &quot;plugin&quot; to the framework. I want global contexts that allow plugins to access things like databases, env vars, and 3rd party api clients.

Helm is widely known as &quot;the package manager for Kubernetes&quot;.

Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes packages called charts. Helm can create new charts from scratch, interact with chart repositories where charts are stored, and most importantly install and uninstall charts into an existing Kubernetes cluster.
For Helm, there are three important concepts: 
The chart is a bundle of information necessary to create an instance of a Kubernetes application.

This was Virtual Coffee&#x27;s third Hacktoberfest (🤯) and it was another great one! Our members knocked it out of the park as usual, and we wanted to take a moment to celebrate!
Our Virtual Coffee Hacktoberfest Initiative (VCHI) is an annual event where our members come together to help each other contribute to Open Source and hopefully complete Digital Ocean&#x27;s Hacktoberfest Challenge. Some of our members are maintainers of their own repos, some sign up as mentors for members who are new to open source, and some sign up just to get Hacktoberfesting (or Hacktoberfestering if you&#x27;re Dan)!
This year we had an awesome team of volunteers helping the maintainers out running things - so a very special ✨ thank you ✨ to Dominic Duffin, Enrico La Cava, Joe Karo…</span>

Lua is a scripting language used for procedural programming, functional programming, and even object-oriented programming. It uses a C-like syntax, but is dynamically typed, features automatic memory management and garbage collection, and runs by interpreting bytecode with a register-based virtual machine. This makes it a great language for beginners, but also a powerful tool for experienced programmers.
Lua has been somewhat eclipsed from the public view by languages like Python and JavaScript, but Lua has several advantages that make it popular in some major software projects. Lua is easily embedded within other languages, meaning that you can include Lua files in the code base of something written in (for instance)…</span>

Long ago, when I was a tech administrator for Arlington Public Schools, I received an unexpected email saying, &quot;Our school in India loves your children&#x27;s stories, so we&#x27;ve printed them all out in braille.&quot;
Apparently, the school had found my collection of children&#x27;s stories on the web. I spent a moment visualizing those students so far away, enjoying my stories on those printed pages of braille. The email&#x27;s sender might not have realized how meaningful their email was to me, but it&#x27;s stayed with me for two decades.
Tell collaborative stories with open source
That experience got me thinking about how technology can weave new connections between people in different countries. While surfing…</span>

                              <span>11 月 3 日，2022·云栖大会上，阿里云智能总裁张建锋表示，以云为核心的新型计算体系正在形成，软件研发范式正在发生新的变革，Serverless 是其中最重要的趋势之一，阿里云将坚定推进核心产品全面 Serverless 化，帮助客户更好地实现敏捷创新。

“我们希望让用户做得更少而收获更多，通过 Serverless 化，用云就像用电一样简单。”张建锋表示，Serverless 将让云计算从一种资源真正变成一种能力，未来云将全面 Serverless 化，更加接近“电网”模式，按计算的调用次数付费。



Serverless 让软件研发产生根本性改变 

Serverless 并不是不用服务器，恰恰相反，它将服务器全权托管给了云厂商，根据业务流量大小自动弹性伸缩，开箱即用免去维护成本，按使用量计费。用户无需关心和管理底层IT资源，只要聚焦业务代码，根据实际请求处理业务。

依托于 Serverless 架构，云上研发方式正在发生根本性的改变。从过去的集中式研发、分布式研发，到云上的组装式研发，实现了软件研发的服务化、模块化、可编排、可组装。无论是 2 万用户还是 2000 万用户体量，基于 Serverless 构建的 IT 架构都可以自适应伸缩，峰值秒级自动扩容、峰谷自动缩容。

作为国内首家投入 Serverless 的云厂商，阿里云早在 2017 年就推出首款 Serverless 产品——函数计算，开发者只需编写代码并上传，函数计算就会自动准备好相应的计算资源，大幅简化开发运维过程。

目前，阿里云已经拥有超过 20 款 Serverless 产品，包括函数计算 FC、Serverless 应用引擎 SAE、Serverless 容器服务 ASK、PolarDB 数据库、AnalyticDB 数仓等。其中函数计算日调用次数超过 200 亿次，有效支撑历年双 11 百万 QPS 洪峰，业务年均增速超 300%，整体规模位居国内首位。



初创公司和大型企业都在使用 Serverless

“以前搞大促我们技术团队都睡不着觉，要时刻盯着服务器水位，心里都没谱”，世纪联华是最早试水 Serverless 的新零售代表，联华华商技术负责人楼杰表示，“现在我们不用管理服务器这些基础设施，只要编写代码上传，函数计算就会准备好计算资源，水位远远高于我们储备能力的极限。”世纪联华将会员系统、交易系统、支付系统等迁移到阿里云函数计算上处理，促销准备时间从周级缩短到小时级，研发运维提效 30%，成本下降 40%，真正把促销活动变成常态。

流媒体平台南瓜电影，因为一场热映电影 1 小时内增加了 100 万用户，是当时日常流量的 5 倍以上，流量暴涨引发网站服务一度中断，临时云上扩容也无法及时满足巨大的流量。了解到 Serverless 的优势后，南瓜电影果断将系统直接部署到阿里云  Serverless 应用引擎 SAE 上，不用改造应用代码，直接上传部署 WAR/JAR 包，省去了购买服务器和运维的过程，“云上资源想弹多少弹多少，想什么时候弹就什么时候弹。”峰谷时按需自动缩容，七天内就完成了新架构的升级和部署，总成本下降  40%，运维效率提升 10 倍，从容应对突发流量。

除了广泛应用的小程序外，Serverless 还受到电商大促、音视频转码、AI 算法、游戏分发、物联网等场景的青睐。权威分析机构 Gartner 预测，2025 年将有 50% 以上的全球企业采用 Serverless 架构。</span>

                              <span>11 月 3 日，在 2022 云栖大会上，阿里云智能总裁张建锋发表主题演讲，他认为历经十多年的发展，云计算带来的变革依然被严重低估，它正在重构整个 IT 软硬件和终端世界，形成一个全新的计算体系。新一轮的科技变革正在深入发展，阿里云将坚持技术长征，面向下一代体系去构建第二技术曲线，抓住未来技术的定义权。

张建锋认为，以云计算为核心的新型计算体系，正在带来三大变革：首先，云重构了整个 IT 硬件体系，数据中心、芯片、服务器等产业链发生深刻变化；其次，软件研发范式发生深刻变革，Serverless、低代码、AI 大模型开源等趋势，大幅提升软件生产效率；最后，云和端加速融合，算力从端转移上云，未来万物皆是计算机。



重构整个 IT 硬件体系

张建锋回顾云计算演进历程，过去十多年，云的创新主要集中在软件领域，首先出现了分布式虚拟化，而后实现了资源池化，形成了广泛的应用规模。现在，云计算已经从软件创新，走向软硬件协同创新，用云来定义整个 IT 硬件体系。

今年，阿里云发布了一款云数据中心专用处理器 CIPU，替代 CPU 来管理和加速计算、存储和网络资源。这是一种全新的架构方式，代表着云计算深入到数据中心内部做体系化创新。CIPU 实现了全面专用硬件加速的高性能，包括高带宽、高吞吐和弹性 RDMA 的能力。“飞天+CIPU”的组合性能表现普遍优于业内同类产品，性能可提升 20% 以上。

在此基础上，阿里云基础设施已经广泛基于 CIPU 架构进行建设，并且构建了全栈自研的基础设施，例如自研 CPU 芯片倚天 710、磐久服务器、EIC 高性能网卡、磐久交换机、磐久液冷一体机、磐久液冷集装箱等自研硬件。

去年，阿里巴巴发布了首款“为云而生”的芯片倚天 710。目前，倚天 710 云实例已在多家互联网科技公司大规模应用，算力性价比提升超 30%，单位算力功耗降…</span>

                              <span>@rrhoover !

After starting a new job with the CIA shortly after, I took a break from Founder&#x27;s Choice to focus on my career.

I left the Agency after 2.5 years due to my father&#x27;s passing and I immediately wanted to get back to Founder&#x27;s Choice and bring it back stronger than ever!

The purpose of Founder&#x27;s Choice is to be a one-stop-shop for people to discover new startups and learn how to build their own. After receiving some feedback, we confirmed that this combination of content (startup discovery + startup development) is a bit more refreshing than the constant venture capital news with startup profiles spliced in between.

One big change since our last launch is a heavier focus on building a community around the platform. We&#x27;re growing on Reddit at r/founderschoice and I&#x27;ll be launching a podcast in the near future where I&#x27;ll talk startups and invite some other founders on to discuss how they gained traction.

Thanks (again) for the support and I hope to meet you all in the community some day! 🙂

                              <span>@patrick_pijnappel and I built Luminal because we were frustrated with existing Python notebooks. 

Python is a very powerful programming language, but it can be hard/confusing to use! There are a few aspects to this:

- Python likes functions with _lots_ of arguments. Without good type info this means constantly switching back and forth between the docs and your editor.
- Except for basic syntax errors, you generally don&#x27;t know that you have an error in your code until you run it. This can be very annoying, especially if running takes a while!
- Many things that are commonly done in Python are well... common. Reading data, plotting, writing data, filtering, etc. However, they can still take quite a while to figure out in practice. That shouldn&#x27;t be the case!

That&#x27;s where Luminal comes in.

Luminal was built with static typing at its core from day one, so when you write code you have best-in-class auto-complete right there, including all the relevant type information and docs (even for specific parameters!).

With Luminal, you can find issues in your code earlier (before you run your code), or use no-code cells for repetitive or tedious tasks.

You can collaborate on a script with others in real-time or share it via link for someone else to use.

... And this is just the tip of the iceberg! There&#x27;s so much we want to do with Luminal to take the friction out of writing Python, but a product has to start somewhere and this is it! We hope you&#x27;re as excited as we are about making Python easier to use and we&#x27;re looking forward to your thoughts and feedback!

英国准备立法废除传真机

传真机由施乐公司在 1964 年商业化，1980 年代起被世界各地的企业广泛使用，如今已被电子邮件、扫描仪、云端传真和即时通讯服务所取代。虽然传真机早已过时，但英国卫生服务机构仍在大量使用它，英国国家医疗服务系统现在还有数百台传真机。英国通信监管机构 Ofcom 表示它准备修订电信规则淘汰传真机。

OpenSSL 3 漏洞补丁释出，危险程度比预想要轻

由于 OpenSSL 3 出现了严重安全漏洞，原计划在 10 月底发布的 Fedora Linux 37 延迟发布。现在，OpenSSL 3 发布了补丁，修复了两个缓冲溢出漏洞。漏洞等级从之前被认为与“心脏流血”漏洞相当的“超危”降为“高危”。这两个漏洞影响所有 OpenSSL 3.x 系列，不过目前主要使用的版本 OpenSSL 1.x 不受影响。

                              <span>本文介绍我使用 Terraform 五年之后吸取到的经验。




使用 Terraform 五年的经历让我吸取到一些重要经验。无论团队大小、项目性质，有五条要点对于配置合乎逻辑且可用的 Terraform 平台至关重要。

1、了解你的目标受众

这一点似乎显而易见，但我也见过一些在这方面犯错的案例。当组织和规划 Terraform 的相关代码时，无论是将目录结构标准化还是确定命名规范，考虑目标受众是非常重要的。例如：你的团队是否会使用这些 Terraform 脚本和模块？你是否会向其他团队交接工作？你的团队是否会有新成员加入？你是否正在独自进行项目开发？你是否会半年或一年后仍然使用这些配置，还是会将它安排给别人？

这类问题会影响某些决策。理想情况下，无论如何都应该有 远程状态Remote State 和 状态锁定State Locking 两种状态。远程状态确保你的笔记本电脑不是你的 Terraform 唯一运行的机器，状态锁定确保同一时刻只有一个人对基础设施进行修改操作。

命名规范应该对项目的最终拥有者有意义，而不是只对开发团队有意义。如果项目会转交给其他团队，应该确保他们对命名规范有发言权。如果代码由非技术的利益相关者或内部安全/ GCR 团队负责审查，应该确保他们会检查命名规范。另外，对于资源名称，为了让代码审查人员更仔细地进行检查，你应该使用资源标签，把有关的数据分类/隐私需求（高、中、低）标示出来。

2、重用，重用，重用

Terraform 注册表 为大多数普通用例提供了现成模块类库。我已经使用过 VPC 模块和安全模块中的大量功能，这些功能只需要提供相关的参数就能使用。使用不同的参数，简单调用这些模块对于处理大部分用例已经足够了。尽可能多地重用这些公共模块，可以避免大量且重复的编码、测试、检查、修复、重构等操作。

                              <span>这是在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 系统中安装 Viber 的快速指南。


Viber 是一个免费、安全的通话和聊天程序，适用于所有流行的移动平台和操作系统。

它具有丰富的功能，例如语音/视频通话、支持 GIF 的文本消息、贴纸、照片和视频。此外，Viber 还具有群聊、群呼和消失消息功能。

Viber 是一个闭源程序，但有免费的 Linux 原生可执行客户端。

下面是安装它的方法。

在 Linux 上安装 Viber

它以 AppImage 可执行文件、deb 和 rpm 包的形式提供。按照下面的相应按钮直接下载。平均可执行文件大小约为 180MB。


下载适用于所有 Linux 发行版的 Appimage



适用于 Ubuntu 的 Deb 可执行文件



Fedora 的 RPM 包


如果你已下载 AppImage，只需从任意文件管理器将权限更改为可执行文件即可。然后运行。

对于 Ubuntu、Linux Mint、Debian 和相关发行版，你可以通过多种方法安装 deb 包。

你可以通过已安装的软件管理器双击打开。或者通过 dpkg 命令安装，如下所示。

sudo dpkg -i viber.deb


对于 Fedora 和基于 RPM 的软件包，你可以通过以下命令安装。

sudo dnf localinstall viber.rpm


对于 Arch Linux 和其他发行版，你可以使用我上面提到的 Appimage。

使用

完成安装 Viber 后，通过应用菜单打开它。以下是你需要记住的几件事。

在从笔记本电脑/台式机开始使用 Viber 之前，你需要在手机上进行设置。从以下链接为你的移动平台下载并安装 Viber。


谷歌应用商店

苹果应用商店


安装后，设置 Viber。请记住，它需要你的手机号码才能注册。

设置完成后，在 Linux 桌面上打开应用。你应该会看到如下页面。



从你的手机应用扫描二维码，你应该可以在 Linux 桌面上使用 Viber。

注意： 由于它是一个闭源应用，请确保你在使用 Viber 时了解此应用的条款和与隐私相关的情况。

欧盟新的《数字市场法案》（DMA）于今天生效，进入六个月的实施阶段，将于名年 5 月 2 日开始适用。DMA 将适用于符合其 “看门人” 标准的科技巨头，并迫使他们向其他公司和开发者开放其各种服务和平台。苹果几乎可以肯定被列为“看门人”，因此将受到 DMA 的约束。这可能迫使苹果公司让用户访问第三方应用程序商店，并允许在 iPhone 和 iPad 上进行应用程序侧载，使用第三方支付系统，访问苹果收集的数据，以及提高 iMessage 互操作性等等。

老王点评：不能不说，欧盟的这些法律极大地制裁了那些垄断巨头。




Mozilla 公布它的 Manifest V3 扩展方案

Manifest V3（MV3）是 Chrome 的新扩展规范，Chrome 将从明年 1 月开始逐步淘汰之前的 MV2 扩展。Mozilla 的 MV3 和谷歌的 MV3 之间有些区别，最重要的是没有采用谷歌的声明式网络请求（DNR），而保留了 MV2 的 WebRequest API。这也是新的扩展系统引发广泛争议的地方，广告屏蔽扩展如 uBlock Origin 使用 WebRequest 在广告下载前屏蔽其请求。

Meta 宣称其 AI 音频编解码器提供 10 倍于 MP3 的压缩率

上周，Meta 公司宣布了一种名为 “EnCodec” 的人工智能驱动的音频压缩方法，据说可以将音频压缩到比 MP3 格式小 10 倍的 64kbps，而且人耳听不到质量损失。其关键是识别人类无法察觉的变化，他们使用鉴别器来提高生成的样本的感知质量，该模型通过让重建的样本与原始样本在感知上更加相似来生成样本以“欺骗”鉴别器。

老王点评：通过 AI 分析人耳不能识别的部分，从而“骗过”鉴别器，这真是一种巧妙的方法。AI 越来越做到一些人所做不到的地方。</span>

这正是我第一次接触 Vanilla OS 时的想法。

当 Bottles 的创建者 Mirko Brombin 在 Twitter 上宣布它时，让我对它产生了兴趣 😎。

我加入了他们的 Discord 频道并成为了一名测试者。虽然我没有做出什么贡献，但关注项目发展是很有趣的。

回到至关重要的问题上：什么是 Vanilla OS？

Vanilla OS 的目标是提供一个干净、原味的 GNOME 体验，并具有按需不变性的能力。

听起来很有趣？让我告诉你我试了试它的第一个开放测试版本后的一些细节。


💡 Vanilla OS 计划在 11 月有一个稳定的版本。

它将跟随 Ubuntu 的小版本发布。

因此，你可以期待每年发布两个版本。例如，你可以从 Ubuntu 22.04 升级到 Ubuntu 22.10 甚至更之后的版本。

除非你知道自己在做什么，否则你不应该把它作为日常系统来使用。


Vanilla OS：又一个基于 Ubuntu 的发行版？



是，也不是。

对于初学者来说，我认为有以下独特的理由可以尝试一下：


在 Ubuntu 之上获得 原装 GNOME 体验。（Fedora 也是一个很好的选择，但并不适合所有人！）

在其安装后的首次设置时，允许你选择并启用 Flatpak/Snap/AppImage。

按需不变性，意味着你可以使系统变成只读，以防止来自第三方应用程序和更新的关键变化。

一个新的软件包管理器（apx）允许你默认在管理的容器内安装软件包。


首次设置过程的体验很轻松。


ℹ️ 目前，它使用 Calamares 安装程序。他们打算用 Crystal Linux 中使用的 Jade 取代它。




越来越多的发行版投身于此；我相信更多的用户会乐意加入到 Linux 中来。



Vanilla OS 对软件包管理器的选择

当然，像 Ubuntu MATE 和 Pop!_OS 这样的发行版已经付出了巨大的努力，而 Vanilla OS 也为此增加了一些改进。



这看起来是一种漂亮的体验！😊

一旦你完成了首次设置，你就没有什么可担心的了。你会得到通常的 GNOME 桌面，以及由 Patrik Kramolis 制作的漂亮的壁纸。



接下来，我试着检查了按需不变性，你可以用以下命令查看和调整：



你可以在 GitHub 上了解更多这个（基本上）使之成为可能的工具。

接下来，看看新的软件包管理器，我喜欢 Distrobox 的底层概念，使其与 apx 成为可能。

Distrobox 的创建者 Luca di Maio 也参与了 Vanilla OS 的开发。

不过，当用 apx 安装一个软件包时，你需要用命令来初始化容器：

apx init


如果它能自动完成，那就更直观了。



当然，我不知道技术上的限制。但是，对于用户端来说会感觉更顺滑！

总的来说，一个利用容器安装应用程序的软件包管理器、获得选择你的软件包管理器的能力、按需不变性，以及原味的 GNOME 使它看起来是一个值得关注的好东西。

前面的路：第一印象

我觉得，一旦它进入稳定版，它就会成为我的日常使用系统。

原因是：我总是喜欢原装的 GNOME 体验，而且不需要处理 Fedora 的定期升级。

当然，等我使用了稳定版之后，我可以给你写一篇整体的用户体验评判。

在那之前，我想说这是一个我相信很多用户都会喜欢的项目 👏。

目前，你可以通过加入其 Discord 频道来下载 ISO。该 ISO 还没有公开向所有人提供。如果你感兴趣，可以看看它的 文档。


Vanilla OS


然而，按照路线图，他们计划很快就会有一个候选版本。

Advertisers sell the myth of the &quot;Smart Home&quot; as a magical world where you automate everything with ease to simplify your life and free your mind of trivial tasks. It looks great on paper and TV, but so far, it&#x27;s mainly been a battle of technologies and manufacturers.
Suppose you want to add a presence sensor from manufacturer A to your existing hub from manufacturer B so you can switch ON your light from manufacturer B. Or perhaps you want to switch OFF your air conditioner when your door is open, but the door sensor is not from the air conditioning manufacturer. Will it work?
There&#x27;s a significant chance that the devices you want to link to one another don&#x27;t talk the same …</span>

                              <span>iA Writer 是一款非常著名的，以简洁优美的界面和不错的使用体验著称的 Markdown 写作软件（虽然我没用过）。而最近，iA Writer 的开发商 iA.net 发布了一款名为 iA Presenter 的幻灯片制作软件，旨在通过简单的 Markdown 创作出精美的幻灯片。
市面上制作幻灯片的软件已经是数不胜数，除了常见的 PowerPoint、Keynote，还有基于 HTML5 技术的 Prezi、reveal.js、Canva 等，基于文档生成幻灯片的软件也有不少，比如双链笔记软件 Obsidian、文档工具语雀、飞书文档、石墨文档都有演示模式。
在这么多软件之中，iA Presenter 又有哪些优势，值得我们从繁杂的工作中抬起头来呢。
首先说明一下，目前 iA Presenter 还处于一个非常早期的阶段，文中提到的一些内容随时可能会因为软件的版本更新而发生变更。
另外，下文中会将 iA Presenter 简称为 iA Pre。
在此，也感谢 @南山居氪 提供的 iA Presenter 的邀请码。
PowerPoint 发生了什么
似乎现在很多软件都在以一种革命性的姿态来发布——认为自己的诞生能够颠覆一个行业，至少在发布时会伴随着一些阐述自己设计哲学的文章。Roam 和 Arc 是如此，iA Pre 也有些这样的味道。
iA 在其新闻页面上发了两篇文章，主要在说 PowerPoint 等传统幻灯片工具有什么问题，和 iA Pre 怎样使幻灯片更好？。
在第一篇文章1中，iA 认为，以 PPT 为代表的传统幻灯片工具有着入门难、耗时长、会让演讲者忘记他想说的东西、以及搭配 PPT 的演讲大多很无聊，这种无聊是我们的职业杀手以及事业杀手。
iA 怎样使幻灯片更好？
而在第二篇文章2中，iA 提出了他们认为的让演讲和幻灯片制作变得更好的方法：

                              <span>这篇速成指南诠释了一些步骤，它对于恢复一个 Arch Linux 安装很有帮助。


作为一个滚动发布版本，Arch Linux 有时会崩溃。那不是你自身的问题，而是因为数百个其它的原因，例如一个新内核与你的硬件或软件的兼容性。但是，即使如此，Arch Linux 仍然是比较优秀的，并且提供最新的软件包和应用程序。

但是，有些时候，它会给你带来麻烦，最后你只会看到一个闪烁的光标。

因此，在这种情况下，在你放弃希望前，你可能希望尝试恢复系统的安装以及数据，而不是重新格式化或重新安装。这篇指南在这些方面概述了一些步骤。

恢复 Arch Linux 安装

第一步是创建一个可启动的 Arch Linux 的现场Live USB 。从下面的链接中下载 ISO 镜像文件，并创建一个可启动的 ISO 的启动盘。你可以查看 这篇 关于如何使用 Etcher 创建可启动的 ISO 的启动盘的指南。记住，这一步骤需要在另一个工作稳定的系统上完成，很明显，这是因为你当前系统是不可用的。


下载 arch linux


你需要知道在 你的 Arch Linux 安装在哪个分区上。这是关键的一步。如果你不知道，你可以使用 GParted 来找出来。或者在你的 Grub 菜单中查看，或者也可以运行下面的命令来找出来。这将列出你所有的磁盘分区、大小和标签。

sudo lsblk -o name,mountpoint,label,size,uuid


在完成后，插入 USB 设备，并从中启动。你应该会在现场 USB 启动后看到 Arch Linux 提示符。

现在，使用下面的命令挂载 Arch Linux 分区。将 /dev/sda3 更改为你实际对应的分区。

mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
arch-chroot /mnt

人们设立了自动监听站，它们甚至可以贴在小如蜜蜂的动物身上。这些数字设备的功能就像一个行星规模的助听器：使人类能够观察和研究大自然的声音，超越我们感官能力的极限。这些数据通过 AI 来处理，找到可能帮助我们理解动物之间的对话的模式，现在已经有了鲸鱼的歌声和蜜蜂的舞蹈等数据库。但这也可能带来一个意想不到的滥用：比如将机器人放入蜂巢，欺骗蜜蜂飞到哪里去寻找特定的蜜源，从而对动物进行剥削性使用。

老王点评：AI 确实能做很多好事，但是，如果被滥用也很可怕。你能想象蜜蜂被不断驱使去采蜜直到累死吗？




旧金山举办人工智能艺术展

旧金山的一个名为“人工想象”新的艺术展览展示了艺术家们利用 DALL-E 2、GPT-3 和其他 AI 系统生成的作品。作品包括一系列的作品，从视频到静态图像和雕塑。艺术家和策展人说，这个展览是第一个此类展览，是对人工智能艺术确实是艺术的一个重要认可。一些参加展览的艺术家将当前的时刻比作伴随着照相机到来的类似的手忙脚乱。

老王点评：确实，就像相机的出现不但没有消灭传统艺术，反而成了一种新的艺术门类。




Discord 半年禁止了 5500 万个账户

Discord 最近公布了其季度安全报告，其中指出，在 2022 年 1 月至 6 月期间，约有 5500 万个账户和 68000 个服务器被禁用。其中绝大多数是由于“垃圾信息或与之有关的行为”而被关闭的。只有 1% - 2% 的上诉成功得到了解封。

老王点评：虽然 Discord 上充斥着垃圾信息，但是这么大的数量还是令我吃惊。</span>

当你在操作系统上启动应用程序时，操作系统需要使用某些代码库和实用程序来运行该应用程序。你的操作系统知道如何找到这些库和实用程序，因为它有一个 系统路径，这是一个通往许多应用程序需要的共同共享数据的地图。所有操作系统都有这一点，但用户通常不会意识到这一点，因为他们通常不需要在意它。然而，当你需要编程或使用特殊的网络实用程序或命令时，你可能需要关心你自己的 PATH 变量配置。

PATH 变量使你可以将命令保存到一致的位置，并使用命令提示符或更强大（而开源的）Powershell 从系统上的任何位置调用它们。

例如，假设你想安装开源应用程序 pscp.exe，它是 Windows 上著名的 PuTTY OpenSSH 客户端的命令行界面。你可以将它下载到你的硬盘，但是你的命令行如何知道它的存在呢？其实一开始，它并不知道：

PS&gt; pscp
 pscp: 命令 “pscp” 不能被识别为 cmdlet、脚本文件或可操作程序的名称。
 检查名称的拼写，或者如果包含了路径，则检查路径是否正确，然后再试一次。


如果你正在使用一个开源命令行，例如 Powershell 或 Cmder，那么你将得到一个有用的错误提示，提示这可能是你的路径有问题（或缺少路径）。下面是解决这个问题的方法。

设置 PATH

首先，在桌面上创建一个名为 App 的文件夹。

接下来，右键单击屏幕左下角的 Windows 菜单，然后选择 “系统System”。



在弹出的 “系统System” 窗口中，单击窗口左侧的 “高级系统设置Advanced system settings” 链接。

在出现的 “系统属性System properties” 窗口中，单击窗口底部的 “环境变量Environment variables” 按钮。



在 “环境变量Environment variables” 窗口中，单击 “用户变量User variables” 面板下的 “新建New” 按钮。



在弹出的对话框中，为 “变量名Variable name” 字段输入 PATH，为 “变量值Variable value” 字段输入 %USERPROFILE\Desktop\App 。单击 “确定OK” 按钮保存更改。



在 Desktop/Apps 中放置你想从命令提示符中访问的命令和应用程序，Powershell、Cmder 甚至 Cmd 都能找到它们。

PS&gt; pscp –version
 pscp: Release 0.XY
 Build platform: 64-bit x86 Windows
 PS&gt;


自动设置路径

许多应用程序会在安装过程中自动添加到系统路径中。然而，并不是所有的程序都如此，要么是因为你在安装过程中遗漏了一个复选框，要么是因为应用程序开发人员希望你自己添加它。当自动路径失败时，你现在知道如何自己设置路径。

                              <span>这里是如何将你当前的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish 升级到 Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu 的步骤。


始终停留在长期支持的发布版本，这是金科玉律。因为，先前的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish 将被支持到 2027 年 4 月。这是一段很长的时间。

此外，LTS 版本超级稳定。它们很少损坏并变得不稳定。因此，如果你在笔记本电脑/台式机电脑或服务器上安装使用 LTS 版本，保持使用它。

然而，如果你想要最新的内核、GNOME 43 和 Pipewire 之类的最新技术 – 你可能会想完成版本跳级，并升级到 Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu。

这里是如何做的方法。

升级 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 到 Ubuntu 22.10

注意：我希望你没有运行去年 10 月份发布的 Ubuntu 21.10 Impish Indri 。因为它已经不被支持。但是鉴于某些原因，你正在运行它，我建议你直接重新安装 22.10 。或者，先升级到 22.04 ，再升级到 22.10 。

在你升级前

在你升级前，做一些内务整理。这是非常重要的。


备份你的 /home、/downloads 和其它的文件到 USB 驱动器或任意独立的分区，以防升级失败。

如果你随着时间的流逝而添加了一些额外的 PPA ，确保将它们记录下来。虽然，在升级过程开始前，升级过程将禁用 PPA 。而在升级完成后，确保手动启用 PPA 。

记录并禁用所有的 GNOME 扩展。如果开发人员没有按照 GNOME 版本进行更新，那么扩展在升级后将会损坏。

家中常备一个现场 USB 磁盘。


升级步骤

打开 “软件包和更新Software &amp; Update” 。

转到 “更新Updates” 标签页。

转到 “通知我新的 Ubuntu 版本Notify me of a new Ubuntu version”，选择并将其更改为 “任意新的版本For any new version”。

这将告诉软件包管理器来查找 Ubuntu 22.10 发布版本的详细信息。



打开一个终端，并运行下面的命令：

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade


或者，你也可以打开软件包更新程序。安装所有的准备就绪的软件包。

在两个命令完成后，打开软件包更新。你将会看到一个升级到 Ubuntu 22.10 的提示（如下图所示）。



现在，单击 “升级Upgrade” 按钮，并按照屏幕上的说明进行操作。升级过程需要一些时间，因此，要耐心等待，直至升级完成。确保在整个升级过程中有稳定的互联网链接。

如果你尚未获得更新，请等待一、两天后再次尝试。

如果你没有看到上述提示，手动重新启动一次系统。并再次添加尝试。

通过终端

在终端中通过 nano 文件编辑器打开下面的文件。

nano /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades


将 Prompt&#x3D;LTS 更改为 Prompt&#x3D;normal 。注意：如果你已经如上所述将更新标签页更改为 “任意新的版本For any new version” ，那么这个文件应该已经更新了。但是，要验证它一次。



分别按下组合键 CTRL+O 和组合键 CTRL+X 来保存和退出。

最后，你也可以运行下面的命令来从终端中强制升级过程。

sudo do-release-upgrade -c




升级过程需要花费一些时间（最少半个小时，上不封顶），这主要取决于你的互联网连接和硬件。直至等到其完成。在完成后，重新启动并享受 Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu.



在升级过程进行时，看看我们 不久前发布的关于 Ubuntu 22.10 的精彩文章。

Log data is one of the fastest-growing segments across data storage. It&#x27;s also one of the most complicated spaces. There are several products and solutions with overlapping use cases and confusing marketing.
This article looks at Parseable, a log storage and observability platform. Parseable is geared towards a better user experience, with an easy-to-deploy and use interface and a simple, cloud-native architecture. I&#x27;ll also show how to set up Parseable with FluentBit to store logs.

Sometimes you need to transfer files over a network. There are lots of file sharing services out there, but most require that you send your file to the Internet. This seems like a long way to go (not to mention the privacy concerns) when two computers are right beside each other, or at least in the same building. The open source WinSCP utility makes it quick and easy to transfer a file or a folder of files over the network from your Windows computer to your Linux computer.

                              <span>很多人会把人生比喻为游戏，因为都需要在既定的规则下，和他人同台竞争谋求最大胜利，读书时的升学排名，就业后岗位的激烈竞争，无一不是要决出个胜负，每个人都要追求赢。
但我们可能从来没有想过，除了参加有输赢的游戏，其实我们还可以选择另一种游戏——没有输赢，可以持续玩下去的游戏。
这便是《有限与无限的游戏》中的观点，它认为世界上至少有有限和无限两种游戏，有限游戏以获胜为目的，无限游戏以延续游戏为目的。
很神奇的是，我之前从《游戏改变世界》这本书中首次知晓该理论时，只是觉得有意思，但对我并没什么启发。

可是真的当我自己看完这本20万字的小书后，对我的影响却是立竿见影的。我读完隔天，在工作上和同事发生冲突时，脑子里一直在想着“不行，我不能像对方一样发火，我要玩的是无限游戏，争一时的输赢的玩不下去了”，因此就忍住了火气，最终也顺利解决了问题。
所以呢今天也为大家推荐这本书，看完后你一定会觉得，哇，原来有些竞争是根本没必要投入的，原来选择还可以有这么多，生活的改变从心态的改变开始，相信你也可以和我一样豁然开朗！
不过该书其实是本哲学书，理解和解读起来有一定难度，而且写法更偏意识流，作者没有特意去构建严密的框架和推理，甚至全书中作者自己都没有直接发表过「无限游戏更好」的结论，所以我会加入个人的理解去解读以便更好地介绍，但我也只是抛砖引玉，建议大家过后去看全书。
一、有限与无限游戏的基本概念
有限游戏有三个显著特征。

它是以取胜为目的，一旦决出胜负则游戏结束，所以称之为有限游戏，注意这里的胜负必须是所有参与者认同，而不是裁判或观众认同。
参与者只能在游戏界限内进行游戏。
有限游戏的规则一经所有参与者认同就生效，且不能改变，否则就是另一个游戏了。

怎么样，听起来是不是很熟悉，几乎跟我们从小到大遇到的竞争一个模式。而无限游戏则恰好是跟它反着来的，它也有三个相对的显特征。

它并非以取胜为目的…</span>

上几篇专栏介绍了绿色系、蓝色系，自然少不了光学三原色的另一名成员——红色。这一期来讲讲红色系键帽，方便各位键友选购搭配自己的梦中情键。

GMK Red Samurai 红武士
R1 2018.2 R2 2020
BASE
这套键帽是由设计师Redsun（红太阳）设计而成，同时他也是GMK蓝武士的设计师，gmk四大武士中的两款由他设计。关于这套键帽的灵感来源有两个版本。
在R1的IC中。

作者表示灵感来自于火影忍者中宇智波斑的铠甲颜色

而在R2中

作者则表示灵感来源于井伊直政（日本历史角色）
关于作者灵感来源，我还是更加倾向于R1中的说法，而为何要改口，可能是为了规避版权问题，但我个人觉得，在红武士中其实并不能看出过多来自于漫画中的角色要素，并且忍者和武士也是两种职业，作者关于忍者和武士的定义，好像也并没有非常清晰。
配色：

暗黄、深红、灰黑，低调而不失深度的配色，黑红相间配以金色点缀，经典耐看。
个性部分：

这一套的个性数量和种类都非常丰富“忍”“侍”，其实这一套键帽虽然称之为武士，但里面也融合了非常多忍者的元素，在武器类型中“飞镰”、“团扇”、“手里剑”、“苦无”，都是非常常见的忍者标志性武器，还有一些不明所以的图案。
其实这位作者在R1中的早期个性设计，是带有浓烈火影忍者特色的。
早期个性设计
穿着盔甲的天狗，很显然是宇智波斑的须佐能乎，以及极其明显的神威万花筒写轮眼图案。
但在最终敲定版本中为了规避版权问题进行了大刀阔斧的修改，最终便呈现出一个极具忍者风味的武士主题键帽。

搭配建议：
深色无疑是合适的，这套键帽很是百搭，红色、蓝色、黄色，都能驾驭，我个人最喜欢灰色和黑色进行搭配，红色也是很不错的，但过于鲜亮的颜色搭配起来难度还是…</span>

                              <span>相信大部份人用的都是拼音輸入法。
學會一個非拼音的中文輸入法，是一件好玩的事，這是一項實用的技能，能證明你的智商和學習能力。
以後搞博客，工作，寫作，成為作家，跟人聊天，等等很多地方都能用上。
其實很多人對「形碼」還存在誤解。

誤解一，除了拼音就是五筆。
其實形碼是一衆不以拼音而是字形部件組合來輸入中文的方法。著名的有：倉頡、鄭碼、五筆，等等。
其中五筆是最有名，但又是最難學最難用的。
誤解二，形碼一定比拼音快。
其實形碼並不一定比拼音快，比如我用倉頡打「哈哈哈哈」，我輸入的是「romr romr romr romr 」，而拼音只需要輸入「hhhh 」。
也就是說，在某些特定場合，拼音，簡拼，比形碼還要快。
那形碼的優點是甚麼？形碼不是快，而是準。形碼人的思維是，如果連準確輸入都做不到，那快有甚麼用？
誤解三，五筆（形碼）很難，要背很多字根。
其實是因為五筆的字根太多太難背，才會給人這樣的感受。我用過五筆兩年，我也承認背字根是一個非常高的門檻。
但是，並不是所有形碼都跟五筆一樣難背。倉頡輸入法的字元就比五筆少很多，好記很多，記下根本不費吹灰之力。
誤解四，學個輸入法要浪費很多時間，學會了也沒甚麼用。
這是極其錯誤的想法。中文打字，不管到哪裏，都是實用的技能。現在網上到處都是同音錯字，比如「再在」不分，就是因為拼音輸入法根本打不準。那麼如果你跟別人文字聊天時，或者發表文章時，能做到用字準確，那不就是一個加分項嗎？
因此，花費一點時間，去學一個形碼，是事半功倍的事。一個好的中文輸入法，是可以用一輩子的。而你只需要用掉幾日的時間來學習。

先寫到這裏。我是中文輸入法專家尹卂，目前在用倉頡。有甚麼問題可以在下方留言。</span>

                              <span>https://www.influxdata.com). InfluxDB is awesome.

But the UI confuses them sometimes. We see people struggling to find their data, make sense of the aggregation windows, compare datasets, etc...

Grafana does not plug the gap for them, because it is mainly aimed at monitoring real-time stuff. Engineers need to interact in a much more interactive way with their test data.

In the past we solved these challenges with Marple for files. Today we bring the same UI to people using an Influx database! 🎉

Marple powers up your InfluxDB, giving you
- speed: optimised flux queries (up to 10x as fast!) 
- UX: no aggregate windows to worry about
- engineering workflow: data exports, statistics, compare time ranges, …
- projects: reuse plots and share interactively with your team

This makes InfluxDB + Marple a powerful combo for innovative teams.

☝️ Can I try it?

Many engineers and craftspeople are particular about their tools. To do a job well, you need the best tools and the skills to use them. The best tools in software development can be very powerful when applied to other kinds of digital creation. The Docs as Code approach is a great example. Docs as Code entails writing documentation using the same tools and workflows used for developing code. Proponents of Docs as Code report that this method leads to better documentation while easing the workload of the people who write it.
Text formats and source control
The most significant adjustment when moving from a more traditional documentation platform to the Docs as Code approach is that the content is …</span>

满打满算，我加入键盘爱好者圈子已经超过三年了。我感觉自己非常有幸，能亲身经历键盘圈子三年间的种种改变。这篇文章，我将结合自己的尝试过的产品、感受到的变化，给大家总结下三年间键盘风向的快速变化，以及展望下未来。
2019 年，热插拔结构萌芽
在 2019 年，客制化键盘圈子当中，热插拔结构逐渐普及开来。
那个时候我是一个很普通的键盘小白。只想要一个高端机械键盘，来满足我一个手游程序员的日常工作需求。而客制化键盘需要买家亲自去组装键盘的所有零部件。而安装轴体对于彻彻底底的小白来说，就是一个非常巨大的门槛。
在当时安装轴体的方法有两种，一种就是传统的焊接，需要用户学习焊接的基础知识，需要购买焊台，焊锡，学习焊接轴体的操作技巧。如果操作不当，还有可能把键盘电路板烧毁、损毁轴体。由于客制化键盘都是采用团购的形式，制作工期极长，所有的零件都是根据购买量定制的，电路板有个三长两短，再找一块电路板来，就不是那么容易的事情了。焊接完成之后，想要更换轴体，更是一件麻烦事，需要重新拆解键盘，学习使用吸锡器。
键盘带有热插拔结构之后，只需要在安装之前，掌握轴体的安装方向，轻轻一按，轴体就安装完成了。可以说是小白新手的福音，能极大的降低客制化键盘圈子的入圈门槛。而在当时，愿意增加热插拔结构的客制化键盘却非常少。
造成这一现象的原因可以分成两方面看待：
一是客观原因。在当时，客制化键盘的生产线没有现今那么强大。零件需要外包出去制作。负责生产的工厂水平参差不齐，最终生产的成品，出现划痕、刀痕、色差也是时有发生。最严重的情况就是外包的工厂心术不正，直接卷钱跑路。…</span>

@王百顺BS：Nutale Air Pro - Airtag下位替代品

入手渠道：淘宝
入手价格：192 元

新发布的 AirPods Pro 内置了 Airtag 又让我重新对这个去年发布的小东西提起了兴趣，恰好看到 Nutale Air Pro 打折，四个套装比单个 Airtag 还便宜，就想试试能不能作为平替。
先放两张外观的图片：
正面：金属边框，两面塑料，有一颗按键，一个发声的开槽（按键手感很差软塌塌的没有反馈）背面：有个放纽扣电池的盖子，用手一推就能打开，一颗 CR2032 纽扣电池
几天试用下来体验还不错，有「Works with Apple Find My」的认证所以可以直接在「查找」app 中的「物品」这一栏添加设备，所有的操作也都是在「查找」app 中，和查看其他 Apple 的设备操作一样。
在查找 app 中的界面，这个两个物品都是
价格便宜自然会有一些缺失的功能，比如：精确查找。 就是到达 Airtag 附近（大概 20 米以内吧）之后触发精确查找，告诉你在什么方向还有多远。 这个功能在 Nutale Air Pro 上是没有的（据说是因为 Apple 还没有开放 UWB 所以市面上还没有第三方的产品具备精确查找），你只能到达附近之后通过播放声音来寻找，声音大小用 Apple Watch 粗略测试了一下可以达到 95 分贝，装到帆布包里间隔两米声音大概 60 分贝，装在包里隔一堵墙距离大概 7 米就需要仔细听了。

                              <span>前言
2022年10月24日，特斯拉官宣降价，基础版本model 3降价1.4万，model y降价2.8万，可以说是非常大的降价幅度，结合2022款整体上更新的车机芯片加上扩大的电池容量，一部分车款可以说是重回性价比车型的行列。
我们讲电车使用成本低，是基于有家用充电桩的环境，如果都用特斯拉超充，不算停车费，每公里电费都能到3毛以上，而使用谷时电家充，每公里电费可以控制在5分钱。但家充桩需要有固定车位，还要向电网申请电表，以及需要物业允许施工的证明，这些硬性条件也劝退着一些潜在车主。
而除了固定的家用充电桩，还有便携充电器，也就是随车充可以作为新能源车的补能方案。随车充在使用上可以使用家庭插座，支持自带线缆从家中接到室外充电，不需要独立电表，对于公司有插座、农村有自建房以及低楼层居民楼住户都比较友好。
本篇选择了四款随车充，覆盖了品牌、设计特点、功率支持的几个不同方向，来详细对比产品设计和具体功能，希望能为随车充的选择答疑解惑。
缆上控制与保护装置（IC-CDP)

其实随车充产品我分析过很多次，它本质上就是从电源到新能源车电机的连接装置，换言之就是一根电源线，电能转化为电池电量都是在新能源车内部完成的。而对于随车充产品消费首先需要重点关注的就是是否配备了缆上控制与保护装置，缩写为IC-CDP。
在国家标准GB/T 18487.1-2015《电动汽车传导充电系统 第一部分:通用要求》中，将就是一根电缆连接电动汽车和交流电网的随车充称为模式1产品；将电缆上加入IC-CDP的随车充产品称为模式2产品。前者可以为车充电，根据电缆长度不同售价在200元上下，但模式1产品缺乏保护功能和控制功能，便宜但抗风险能力基本为0。后者模式2则是大部分车主的核心选择，通过控制盒可以实现各种差异化功能，特斯拉、比亚迪的原厂随车充我们称为车规产品，都是模式2随车充。
对于我们私家车主而言，充电安全…</span>

2022 年，对我来说是不平凡的一年，键圈的兴亡成败在这一年格外明显。也是这一年我开始从一个消费者转变成一个创作者，遇到了更多的人，也想了了更多过去不会思考的问题。下面来讲讲我这一年的所思所想和所感，以及今后的一些打算。虽然都是些浅短的认识，但是分享出来也算是一种体验，非常感谢大家的观看和意见。欢迎评论区友好讨论。
键盘圈的大趋势
现代社会人与人的交流不再局限于过去话语和书信的形式，而更多倾向于快捷的网络输入交流。快捷频繁的信息互通使得输入工具成为生活工作长时间高频率接触的日常用品。2020 年的疫情提早将线上办公大规模地带入人们的生活之中，人们也重新开始审视自己的办公桌搭，机械键盘市场在疫情之下，不降反增。
机械键盘热度上涨这件事，无论是从日常生活中关于机械键盘话题讨论度愈发增高，还是从近些年来机械键盘品牌数急剧增加都可以得到一定程度的论证。
数据来源：什么值得买
近些年来，在机械键盘领域我能明显感知到的就是选择越来越多了，无论是量产还是客制化，无论是轴体、键帽、套件。国内机械键盘在「物质」水平上，毫无疑问的成长了。
在轴体领域，国产轴体自 2010-2012 开始萌芽，在 2019 年这个关键节点打出了名声，国内轴体市场也从 Cherry 的独角戏演变成现在的百家争鸣。
佳达隆的产品时间线 2012—2020
在键帽领域，过去的客制化玩家大多只能选择 GMK、SP 等海外品牌，如今有国产老牌客制化键帽 JTK、2019 年出现的 Domikey 和 2022 年入场的 PBTfans 以及各种各样的键帽代工厂，包括量产领域也出…</span>

                              <span>最近我在抽屉里翻出来一台尘封已久的 iPhone 5s，它刚刚在 20 年才从我手中退役，一眨眼它就快发布十年了。在用它的时候我其实对手机了解很少，也不懂摄影，就只是拿来刷网页。于是趁着这个由头，重头开始了解一下 iPhone 的一些变化。首先想写的是 iPhone 相机的一些内容，暂时先写单摄时代的 13 款机型。照例先给出我全文的脉络，供各位参考。

iPhone + iPhone OS 1 / iPhone 3G + iPhone OS 2
2007 年 1 月 9 日，乔布斯在初代 iPhone 的发布会上只用了一句话介绍其搭载的相机

看后面，最显眼的就是内置的 2 百万像素摄像头。
iPhone 发布会
 
关于相机方面大量的篇幅其实是在介绍照片软件，搭配 3.5 寸的可触摸屏幕，可以向左滑动或向右滑动查看照片，捏合放大缩小，横置手机的同时照片也跟着变换方向等。

第三个我想要展示给大家看的手机功能是照片。你知道的，我之前说过，在iPhone里内置有一台二百万像素的相机，我们也有着最酷的照片管理软件，它在移动设备中是最好的。但是我认为它在所有的平台中也都堪称最棒。这是我们的照片，我正在进入照片库，这就是照片库，在这里我可以用我的手指来滑动浏览照片，相当酷。让我们看看相册，我要选择意大利，让我们从第一张开始，我可以通过滑动手机来浏览这些照片。我可以翻看照片库，大家看这是一张风景照片，现在我调转了我的手机方向，然后它就变成了这个样子，酷吗？怎么样？当我在看这张风景照片的时候我也可以滑动它。怎么样？是不是看上去还不错？我还可以把一些照片放大，我能用我的手指来对它进行缩放。我可以让手指分开来让图片变大，酷不酷？我还能移动照片，怎么样，酷吗？还可以把照片设置为手机壁纸，这样就能设置成为壁纸。当我回到主页，然后锁屏，当我解锁之后，我设…</span>

                              <span>之前，我在《论文读不懂怎么办？》一文中，给你介绍了论文阅读遇到问题时的几个解决方法。尤其是介绍了你可以求助的免费资源和路径，它们包括但不限于：

幻灯
博客
视频
课程
代码

那篇文章，在知乎上获得了 2600 个赞（截止 2022 年 10 月）。我相信，对于很多同学，起到了帮助。

只不过，环境和技术在变化，我们解决问题的方法和思路，也应该与时俱进。
这不，因为有了大规模自然语言处理模型的加持，阅读论文时遇到不认识的名词，或者无法理解作者的简单解释时，我们有了一种新的对策。
具体的方法，就是人工智能替你阅读后，把内容综合整理，结合上下文转换成简单清晰的语言，再反馈给你。
这个想法，其实并不新鲜了。翻看近几年自然语言处理领域的论文，你能看见不少相关的研究。
只不过，那些研究成果只存在论文中，或者是在某个实验室的电脑里面，普通人根本无法接触，更不要说利用了。
这回可不一样，有人（ \@amanjha__ and \@functionofjade）居然真的就做了个产品出来。
这个应用的名字，叫做 explainpaper ，非常直白吧？

使用起来也特别方便。不用去菜单里面点选找寻。只要你把论文传上去，高亮某一个词语、短语或者段落，人工智能就会自动为你解读。

不仅如此，你还可以就着 AI 反馈的结果，继续追问。
这种应用演示不大适合图文。所以我干脆为你做了 一段演示视频，你可以先看看。
 
 
看完之后，感受如何？
反正不少小伙伴表示，很兴奋。

这东西背后的技术是啥？当然还是咱们的老熟人 ------GPT-3.
其实 GPT-3 这模型的特点，说穿了就是大。因为模型庞大，参数众多，所以从海量语料库里积攒的「认知」就多。注意我这里刻意回避了「知识」这个词儿。

（资料来源：t.ly/cY1kn）
从上图中，你不难看到，现在的文本和代码生成中，GPT-3 都占据了重要位置。
我喜欢共享内容的原因之一，是视频发出后总可以获得观众进一步的反馈。不少的问题，都会激发我的思考。
例如有小伙伴在视频后面提问，说这个东西能不能帮着理解中文论文啊？

这是个很好的问题。毕竟很多国内人文社科研究生平时阅读的论文，更大比例是中文的。
我一开始觉得这个问题问得有些太贪心了。对于一个外国人做的刚上线应用，你指望人家立即支持阅读中文，还能看懂中文的研究论文，不大现实吧？
刚要回复，我突然想起来 上次在 Lex 上面的教训了。既然 explainpaper 的底层模型是 GPT-3 ，那它本来就该认得中文啊。
为了确保回答准确，还是实际测试一下吧。我传了一篇自己的论文上去。

中文划线高亮之后，AI 反馈的结果让我有些吃惊。
尽管 explainpaper 并不能直接用中文来解释信息。但它可以立即识别出「知识管理」就是 knowledge management ，然后进一步解释下去。
下面这段解释，就更有意思了。

它先广泛解释「插件」是啥，然后结合本文的上下文，指出 Roam Toolkit 是一种插件，并且描述了它的功能。
不仅如此，从下图可以看出，就连划线的时候字符之间出现了空格间隔，也依然能正常识别和解释。

下面，我故意找了个文中没有进行详细解释的「概念网络」，结果是这样的。

我能确定，这解释里面出现的「宠物」、「猫」、「狗」啥的，肯定没在本文正文出现过。
Evernote 这一段，让我愣住了。

Explainpaper 居然是准确识别了这张表格，并且把内容总结梳理，然后用英文输出了出来。
上述的演示，是不是回答了读者的问题呢？我觉得算不上。从需求分析来看，人家看中文论文遇到术语不清楚，自然是需要中文的解释。你再弄成英文给我，这......
可换个角度想想，这东西帮助外国人阅读中文论文，可是再好不过了。遇到中文专业词汇，随时可以获得准确的英文解释，而且阐述还贴合论文的上下文。外国人读中文论文，将减少很多障碍。这或许可以快速提升中文论文的影响力，妙啊！
另外，目前 explainpaper 缺乏中文解释能力，也给国内的开发者提供了发展空间。希望早日看到更多 AI 实际应用上线，帮助国人理解中文论文。
我期待你能自己尝试一下这款在线应用。至少在目前，它是免费的。而且因为上传的都是公开发表的论文，也不存在用户隐私泄漏问题。所以可以放心大胆地尝试 ------ 特别是对于最近要写文献综述的小伙伴来说。
欢迎你把自己测试的结果和经验心得，分享在留言区。咱们一起交流讨论。
祝论文阅读愉快！

                              <span>伴随 iOS 16.1 的发布，YaoYao 也适配了 iOS 16.1 相关功能
 
 
灵动岛
当你在手表上开始运动后，再打开手机App，你将发现YaoYao 的灵动岛功能。
灵动岛在 iPhone 14 Pro 上可以使用，你可以把灵动岛理解成一个indicator。

具体有多大用，实际我也没太明白，再就是要看这个功能提供后，各路厂商的想象力，以我自己的判断，Apple 可能也没太明白，这个应该会在后面继续迭代。
实时活动（Live Activity）
这个实时活动和灵动岛是一起的，绑定的，这也是我不太能理解的地方。它不需要iPhone 14 Pro，其他手机也会显示，你可以把它理解成一个特殊的通知.
它能实时显示新跳绳的运动数据，在 iPhone 14 Pro常亮屏的加持下更加好用，个人认为常亮屏是 iPhone 14 Pro 最大的亮点，就像 Apple Watch 自从有了常亮显示，体验大大提高一样。
Live Activity
Apple Watch Ultra 操作按钮（Action Button)
为了适配 Apple Watch Ultra 这个特殊的自定义键（Action Button，手表左侧这个黄色键），我特意买了一个 Ultra，现在在系统里配置该键后，你就可以：
 
 
1. 一键启动YaoYao
2. 按下该键暂停运动
3. 再按下恢复运动（或和右边的侧边键同时按下）
因为不用看屏幕可以直接按，减少了心智负担，实际使用非常好用！变成了我最喜欢 Ultra的功能。之前感觉佳明表全是按键操作，不能触控，拿到手完全不会用，感觉很傻，看来也有一定道理，哈哈。

请将App 更新到最新版，尝鲜以上功能。

为何是阅读器
大学毕业后，我告别了拥有海量藏书的图书馆，开始了漫长的阅读工具体验之旅。
起初，惯性思维让我从当当、京东等大平台买书来读。我喜欢撕掉新书塑封时的期待心情，也慢慢攒起来了自己的第一批库存。新书的开销几乎成为刚毕业的我除吃饭和租房外的第三大支出项。
后来，多抓鱼开始了他们的创业，我也成为了他们的最早一批用户。我在他们的小程序上养成了买二手书的习惯，也尝试着卖掉了一些看完的书。我喜欢这种循环与分享的理念，有时收到他人批注过的书页，时有共鸣，像是在和一名未曾谋面的老友会心一笑。
然而北漂不易，在这样试运行了快三年后，寸土寸金的租房空间已经难以下脚。再加上数次搬家几乎成了北漂的必修课，因此「纸质书」在我这里已经逐渐和「奢侈品」画了等号。我开始把目光转向电子书。
彼时「蜗牛阅读」早于「微信阅读」兴起，我用手机读完每天免费的一小时，眼睛已经感觉酸涩。后来我尝试了 iPad 版本，视觉的疲劳感依然没有好转。于是像每一个热爱阅读或者感觉自己热爱阅读的人一样，我下单了人生的第一台 Kindle，开始了我的阅读器泡面之旅。
Kindle 的小屏幕让我非常不适应。由于阅读惯性使然，为了尽可能获得和纸质书的一页近似的信息量，我需要把字体调整到很小，然而字体变小又让阅读本身变得吃力。加上 Kindle Unlimited 并不优质的资源和第三方网站的不稳定，我发现 Kindle 在我这里并没有代替纸质书的地位，反而是新鲜感过后，逐渐落入吃灰的境地。
再后来，得到 app 开始推出了电子书的业务，上线初期是 148元/年。我这个得到重度用户试用了…</span>

                              <span>引言
iPad中关于键盘的设置与鼠标一样 —— 非常混乱。例如，iPad键盘的设置也是出现在「通用 | 键盘」、「辅助功能 | 键盘」以及「辅助功能 | 触控 — 辅助触控」中。
其中，「辅助功能 | 触控 — 辅助触控」其实就是上一篇文章中的「鼠标键」，具体可以参考《鼠标搭配 iPadOS，如何设置才能更好用？》
「通用 | 键盘 — 实体键盘」
键位调节
在实体键盘中，你可以根据iPad已有的输入法进行键位调节。例如我们常用的是QWERTY键盘，而你可以在这里改成AZERTY等。

 
下面的几项设置中，大家基本都能理解，而且也无关痛痒。笔者认为比较重要的是下面两个：
按下🌐显示表情符号
首先，这个🌐符号在妙控键盘里就是左下角的fn。
显示表情符号这个按钮，比较适合常用emoji😄的场景。例如‼️，一般写小🍠的朋友都需要用较多的emoji来分1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣等小标题，那么打开这个功能就会非常方便啦✨。
实际上，就算打开了这个功能，也不会影响我们切换输入法，因为使用control+空格也能轻松切换输入法，与我们使用Mac的习惯一样。

使用大写锁定键切换语言
第二个功能也是Mac中特有的功能。从Windows换到Mac的用户很不爽的一点是：想按Caplock键来输入大写字母，结果只能切换输入法，非得长按才行。
实际上这个功能是可以开关的，iPad上也一样。打开后，我们可以自由地在当前输入法和英文输入法之间切换（如果当前是简体中文输入法，那么就是中——英；如果是俄语输入法，那么便是俄——英），如果在键盘语言中把英文输入法删除的话，这个功能即使打开也不能使用了。关闭后，我们按下Caplock键就能切换为全大写输入。macOS中也一样，删除自带的中文输入法（英文输入法不能删除），就不能实现这个功能。

                              <span>你好，我是马上要上第 700 节 CrossFit 团课的克莱尔。（但今天是我的休息日。所以我来写稿了。
如果你想减脂增肌，或者厌倦了在普通健身房对着满屋子器械不知从何下手，CrossFit 训练也许是一个最简单粗暴的健身方案。

融合有氧器械、哑铃壶铃、药球、奥林匹克举重与单杠和吊环体操动作， CrossFit 以社区感、团课、每天不重样的训练内容闻名。对，我们每天练的项目都不一样，它要求你什么都懂（一点），对心肺、力量、柔韧性等各方面都有要求。
换句话说， CrossFit 花样丰富，有趣，强度大，但作为一个相对小众的运动，准入门槛也不低。如果你在一二线城市，找到好馆子的可能性会比较大。如果你经常出差—— CrossFit 就像健身界的星巴克，无论到哪个城市，都能找到以相似模式运行的 Box ，能结识不同的朋友。
全球 CF 馆分布
今年是我练 CF 的第三年。根据三年的观察，许多来 CF 新客体验的人常被这项运动的强度或者“对新人不友好”震慑，觉得这是一馆子又壮又爱拼命的疯子。但其实 CF 并没有想象中这么吓人。在进行你的第一次 CF 训练之前，提前知道这些事情可以降低你在馆里低血糖、呕吐或者被吓得从此听到 CF 就绕道走的概率。
离你最近的 CrossFit 训练馆在哪里？
首先，如何找到离你最近的 CF 训练馆？如果你在国内一线城市，在点评 app 里输入 CrossFit 就是最快的方法，如果搜索结果中出现【综合训练】字样，它很有可能也是一个 CF 馆。只是未经 CF 官方认证。这不代表它是山寨——近几年有越来越多场馆认为自己不需要每年缴会费做这个认证，但大家训练的系统是一样的。
如果你在国外，除了谷歌，另一个方法是点进 crossfit.com 网页，在右上角 Find a gym 这里找到经过官方认证的场馆（对国内场馆同样适用，但也许网速会众所周知地慢一点）…</span>

                              <span>写在前面
这个标题其实已经被我修改了一下，因为一边上学一边写稿偶尔真的拖延爆炸。在这之前，其实标题是：“灵动岛到底好不好”。如今我也算是吃了豹子胆，敢直接标题下结论。虽然已经离发布会过了很多天，当时的情绪也已经逐渐稀释，还是想尽可能理性的去一点点解释，为什么不好。
我并不想在文章的一开头就给自己贴上标签，一方面是不喜欢这样的做法，另一方面也是此时的我并没有什么拿得出手的名堂。很多观点都是超级主观的，但也很高兴你能来看看！谢谢你，我的朋友！希望你看的开心！

“好不好”的尺度
对于灵动岛，我感觉我们都有着一样的一条曲折心路：发布会前被剧透难看的感叹号挖孔，发布会时被灵动岛的亮相视频惊艳到再次对苹果重拾希望，但第二天起床琢磨过劲——这也是我们出现分歧的地方：我们都想知道这究竟是另一个 Touch Bar，还是一个能定义 iPhone 接下来几年发展的新设计。
要想搞清楚这个问题，我想讲个有些偏题的故事。
来到伦敦后，一个人住一个只有17平米的房子，空虚寂寞冷的时候也会想用音乐填满自己的房间。于是就在亚马逊上看了看各种音箱。我目前使用的电脑是14寸的 MacBook Pro，但长期会连着一个明基的显示器来用，所以我对这个音箱购买就列下了几条条件：

音质不能比 mac 本身差
必须有 aux，这样我能连接显示器用，受不了蓝牙的音画不同步
能放在显示器的正下方，所以不能太大
好看，别太贵…

在网上看了一圈，我特别喜欢 Marshall 的 EMBERTON II，当时加上一点学生优惠不到100英镑就能拿下。我觉得它小巧精致，光是凭借这好看的皮囊我就快按耐不住自己的购买欲了。可是它却有一个地方不能满足我的需求，它没有 aux，纯蓝牙。当时我的内心就出现了两股力量：一股力量准备 pua 自己，让自己接受蓝牙的延迟；另一股力量开始嘲讽 Marshall 这个品牌的一些关于“音质”和“品…</span>

实话实说，最近软件圈的「玩具」有点儿多。
笔记软件，有 Tana；浏览器，有 Arc；Readwise 新出的一站式阅读器 Reader ，也很不错。
没想到，我又在 Jarod 的知识星球里看到他推荐了一款在线编辑器：LEX。
要来了一个邀请链接后，原本我是打算先留着，有空再仔细尝试。但是，一进入 LEX 的界面，读了官方的介绍，我立刻就不淡定了。

其实，哪里只是我一个人不淡定啊？
Building the Second Brain 作者 Tiago Forte 说，自己已经看到要失业的迹象了。原来，在他用 LEX 试写的一篇文章里，他自己只写了 5 个词儿。
剩下全是 AI 顺着往下编。

至于效率类 YouTube 播主 Ali Abdaal 更是「恶作剧」：他用 LEX 创作了一篇「15 个效率技巧」，拆成一串推文发了出来，结果成了自己反响最热烈的推文。（事后他向大家公开了内容来源。）

当然，Ali 是名人，浏览量是有名人效应的。即使如此，人工智能的作品几乎骗过了所有人的眼睛，还收获了这么多的点赞和转发，这就厉害了。
下面说说我自己的实际测试结果吧。下图中，只有红框里面的文字，是我写的。然后后面的段落，全都是 LEX 自动补全的。

更厉害的是，根据这些内容，LEX 自动生成了若干标题，我只是从中选了一个而已。

LEX 基于风头正劲的 AI 文本生成引擎 GPT-3。其实，原本 GPT-2 时代，人工智能自动补全已经大显神通了。GPT-3 的应用，意味着写出来的东西更真假难辨。

                              <span>近几年区块链逐渐火热以后，「去中心化」的概念逐渐受到关注。
去中心化指的是：在一个分布有众多节点的系统中，每个节点都具有高度自治的特征。
回想一下，你的各种私有资料都储存在哪里？
文档都在 WPS 的云盘，或者散落在各种文件夹中；
音频文件可能分散在网易云音乐、QQ 音乐、酷狗等等音频平台，如果你喜欢音乐的本地化，也许会下载到某个文件夹中；
至于相片这种更为私人的东西，则有可能在手机本地相册或者选择百度网盘、iCloud 等等网络云盘中。
我们经常会把同类的文件分散在各处，当我们想去寻找的时候却往往难以在一个确定的地方查询；又或者遭遇到了平台倒闭，难以取回储存在云空间中的珍贵资料。
所以对于文件的「中心化」储存和管理，是一个值得尝试的文件管理形式。
我认为其中有三个核心：集中管理、本地优先、在线引用
将「中心化」概念运用到相册管理中
比如图片的管理，拿我的个人相册举例。
我们的手机每天都会有很多图片产生：屏幕截图、自拍、风景等等照片，但并非所有的照片都值得长期保存，所以要定期清理无关照片，备份重要的相片。

我从大学时期就开始使用谷歌相册管理我的手机相片，这个堪称当下功能最强大的在线相册，会智能地自动备份相机拍下的所有照片、屏幕截图，甚至还有其他 APP 中保存的图片。同时也可以一键清理本地已备份的图片，节省手机空间。
五年多过去了，我的谷歌相册中积攒了无数张相片，其中超过一半以上的图片都是无关的废片，混杂在各种较为重要的照片中，我花了很长时间都难以删除这些图片。
于是我国庆期间我批量下载了所有的相片，大约 5w 张，其中绝大部分图片都是各种被自动备份的无关照片，经过大约三天的筛选，最终保留下了差不多 7000 多张照片。
那么问题来了，如何让我的相册不再受到污染，能够自动备份到谷歌相册中，而且我希望能够保留一份相册在本地，在我删除本地照片的时候自动在云端也删除。

                              <span>2022国庆七天，秋高气爽良辰美景怎可辜负？驾驶着 Model 3，带上小米 11 Ultra，一路向西北从惠州到桂林。

Model 3 标续版提车于2021 年 12 月，表显续航 423 公里，1.6 万公里后表显降为 418 公里。
去程全长 627 公里，途径佛山百利达广场特斯拉超充站充电一次约 15 分钟，在贺州境内高速上充电一次约 25 分钟。
佛山百利达广场特斯拉超充站选址非常好，就在高速出入口附近，上下高速很方便。贺州境内高速上的快充表现不错，功率一度飙到充电 800 km/h 以上。

提车至今对 Model 3 的续航表现基本满意，天气凉爽的情况下表显多少就能跑出多少，甚至有时候实际续航还会超出表显，不同天气状况下的真实续航表现可以看我的 B 站自驾游视频。
晚霞迎接我们一路向西
到达桂林市临桂区已是晚上 10 点 15 分左右，办好入住第一件事就是去吃一碗桂林米粉。可能因为去的是商业步行街，美食比较商业化，即使当时比较饿了，这碗粉也没有给我带来美味的感觉。

重头戏在第二天的龙脊梯田之旅。龙脊梯田位于桂林龙胜县东南部和平乡境内的龙脊山。龙脊梯田距龙胜县城27公里，距桂林市80公里，景区面积共66平方公里，梯田分布在海拔300至1100米之间，坡度大多在26至35度之间，最大坡度达50度。
从临桂区去龙脊梯田景区大门口要一个半小时左右，桂林真大啊，查了下比北京还要大 1 万多平方公里
根据疫情防控要求，散客只能在景区收费处外面的广场购票，票价 80 元/成年人，和售票处价格一致。
工作人员告知我们，双向单车道的蜿蜒的山路加上堵车，从景区售票处到龙脊梯田里的几个寨子还要差不多 1 个小时的车程。国庆期间人特别多，如果按常规路线开车去名气最大的大寨，开车到坐缆车的地方要 1 个多小时，排队花钱坐缆车还要1个多小时，工作人员收费给我们指明了一条别的路去千层天梯，美景不打折，还可以开车到达。

工作人员收费指明的这条路应该是尚未完全开发的新路，路上看到了多处没有做固化工程的山坡，不少路段有落石和滑坡泥土，还有一个地方路面塌方，行驶起来要格外小心。
使用长焦拍下这张照片，脑海里突然响起《断背山》的配乐，给人一种氛围宁静的感觉
一个多小时后终于达到千层天梯，话不多说欣赏美景吧，看看小米 11 Ultra 记录的龙脊梯田，先来一张全景图。

这张全景图是在千层天梯处拍的，当天天空中飘着淡青蓝色的烟雾，有一种烟雨朦胧的感觉，阳光洒在稻田上勾勒出明暗的分界线，小米 11 Ultra 非常好地还原了真实的色彩和光影。
当时在梯田附近一家民宿停车吃饭，两荤一素一共三个菜（牛蛙+鱼+青菜+米饭）加免费停车 120 元左右，坐在民宿楼下的台阶上吃饭吹风欣赏美景十分惬意，可以说物超所值。

使用小米 11 Ultra 以来最满意的就是它的长焦表现，镜头压缩空间集中表达内容可以拍出非常有故事感的照片。以下照片应该都是 5x-30x 范围内拍摄的（具体记不清了），画质表现超出预期，当天的良好光线也功不可没。
 后期调色套了滤镜
11 Ultra 的主摄表现不错，成片有光影层次，色彩过渡自然，数码味和锐化较少，和肉眼所见十分接近。

当然，小米 11 Ultra 拍照也不是十全十美的，成像慢、多颗摄像头切换动画生硬、逆光自拍效果一般、超级夜景容易糊等等。不过考虑到 3699 元的价格，这些问题也都可以忽略了。
最后附上一些桂林游玩期间的美图（部分有后期），推荐大家去桂林玩，一座现代和古典，先锋流行和土著闲适相结合的奇妙城市，当地人比较友善，这次去也没遇到宰客行为，花费物超所值，值得一去。</span>

                              <span>Hi 大家好呀！我叫 Ask Term 。这是我来少数派写的教程系列文章的第一篇，给大家带来一个开源知识库 Memos 的部署教程，小伙伴们也许会问 Memos 什么？那么我就把官方对 Memos 的定义引用一下：

An open source, self-hosted knowledge base that works with a SQLite db file.

如何还是不太清楚这个是干嘛用的，那么体验一下官方的 Demo，体验过的小伙伴一定会觉得这不就是 Flomo 吗？确实，这算是非官方 Flomo 的开源替代品，鉴于 Memos 的开源特性你可以随意的部署在自己的服务器上去使用。
Memos 的部署也很简单，一条 Docker 命令就能启动，但是对于不熟悉 Docker 的小伙伴或许还是有些难度的，为此我写了这篇入门级的教程，让小伙伴能够轻松完成 Memos 的部署。
Flomo 和 Memos 的功能对比


对比FlomoMemos
收费方式免费有限制开源自托管
API 接口Pro 版免费使用免费开放
每日回顾Pro 版支持支持
微信输入支持不支持


通过对比我认为 Memos 除了在微信输入上欠缺了一点，在其它方面是胜过 Flomo 的，虽然不能够原生的支持微信输入，但是 Memos 官方开放了 API 接口，通过这个接口去连接个人的微信服务号或许可以实现微信输入的功能，网上也有类似通过 Telegram 进行输入的教程。
 
🔞注意：本次的部署环境为： Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
Docker 的安装
附上 Docker 官方部署文档（如果需要更详细的安装流程，请参考官方文档）
如果已经存在旧版本的 Docker并且想要卸载请执行卸载命令（非必要）
