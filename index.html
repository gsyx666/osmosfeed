Here are my learnings from the session, which will teach you how to improve your web development skills with project-based learning.
Let’s go! 🚀
Tutorials are great for solving a specific problem. But you need to create projects to build coding skills.
A real-world project involves a lot of debugging and troubleshooting, which can’t be learned by just following tutorials.
Here, Swapnil who is a top-rated freelance developer suggests
Learning to code is like learning to play football. Once you understand the rules, you improve by practicing. Similarly, you improve your coding skills by building projects.

I&#x27;ve had good experiences with tech recruiters over the past years, but unfortunately, there have also been bad experiences. And this blog post comes from those occasions.
Here&#x27;s the original rant: 
Dear tech recruiter, here are a couple of things I&#x27;d wish from you.
✨ Please don&#x27;t call me. Even though you can find my number somewhere, it&#x27;s not an open invitation to call. I hate speaking on the phone, so you calling me unsolicitedly makes me anxious. And I don&#x27;t want to work for your company or your client if you make me anxious.

                              <span>Hey there! 
This week, I&#x27;ve been looking for some bigger fish to catch, that being doing something bigger than I did before. 
My open source journey so far has been doing more or less simple things, in order to get to know the community better, and get my tool knowledge up right. So, now that I am fairly confident in myself (in terms of Open Source contributing) and my skills, it is finally time to get working harder.
What sounds more perfect in my case than implementing a new feature instead of fixing a visual bug? Exactly! So, my initial plan was to find myself an issue that required to write new code, instead of fixing the existing stuff. It was time to find something to work on.
After searching for a couple of hours, I found an issue that appealed a lot to me.
It was in a repo called Wego Overseer, which appears to be a Discord bot for a specific community. Chat bots have always been something I wanted to try, and this sounded like a perfect opportunity!
The issue itself was about implementing a chat poll feature that could be done via emoji-reactions under a message. This felt to me like something I have been searching for, challenging my skills and not as easy as my previous contributions.
Before jumping right into coding, I will have to examine the project and do some research about the tools it uses, such as Discord.js, knex, and Objection.
First things first, I will have to set it up locally and get it running. Then, I&#x27;ll test it a bit to sense the way it works.
After setting up, I will read through documentation on the tools I have mentioned before. Once I get a hang of how they are used, I will try to design my solution, i.e. how the poll creator UX will feel, how the poll will look like, what logic it will be using in order to show poll results, think of other details, etc.
After my solution is looking good on paper, and I have a feeling of how to implement it, I will start coding. I will try to create a new command first, and then gradually try turning it into how I designed it.
Hoping it goes well!</span>

https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2
TL;DR: my solution in Rust
We&#x27;re playing a Rock, Paper, Scissors tournament with the elves.
Each line has 2 letters seperated by a space.
The first letter is A, B, or C.
The second letter is X, Y, or Z.
An example input looks like this:
A Y
B X
C Z

Each round is worth some points, all scores get summed up, and whoever has the highest total at the end of the tournament wins.
Your score for a single round is the sum of the score for the shape you played, and the score for the outcome of the round.
Shape scores:
Rock: 1
Paper: 2
Scissors: 3
Outcome scores:
Loss: 0
Draw: 3
Win: 6
The first letter in the input is what your opponent is going to play.
Afor Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors.

                              <span>Day 1: Calorie Counting


https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1
TL;DR: my solution in Rust
We&#x27;re on an expedition with the elves.
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000

Find the Elf carrying the most Calories.
For each elf we want to calculate the sum of the items they are carrying.
I did today with one iterator chain.
Get the input string.
For every element: split on a single linebreak.
Now, every element is the sum a single elf is carrying.
pub fn part_1() -&gt; u32 {
    let input &#x3D; std::fs::read_to_string(&quot;src/day01.txt&quot;).unwrap();

    input
    .split(&quot;\n\n&quot;)
    .map(|elf| {
        elf.lines()
            .filter_map(|s| s.parse::().ok())
            .sum::()
    })
    .max()
    .unwrap()
}

Part 2 is very similar.
Find the top three Elves carrying the most Calories.
Get the input string.
For every element: split on a single linebreak.
Now, every element is the sum a single elf is carrying.
To sort the iterator directly, I used the sorted() method from the itertools crate.
.collect() on the iterator of all sums, and store that result in a variable with type Vec.
.sort().
This sorts in ascending order, and I want the sum of the 3 last ones.
use itertools::Itertools;

pub fn part_2() -&gt; u32 {
    let input &#x3D; std::fs::read_to_string(&quot;src/day01.txt&quot;).unwrap();

    input
    .split(&quot;\n\n&quot;)
    .map(|elf| {
        elf.lines()
            .filter_map(|s| s.parse::().ok())
            .sum::()
    })
    .sorted()
    .rev()
    .take(3)
    .sum::()

IBM 和全球最大的集装箱承运公司马士基在五年前合作，建立了一个联盟链 TradeLens，用于航运数据。该联盟链的成员可以验证数字账本上记录的货物交易。但它最终未能在其目标行业中获得足够的支持。“没有达到继续工作和满足作为独立企业的财务预期所需的商业可行性水平。”他们宣布将于 2023 年关闭此项目。

                              <span>Authy 是一款流行的应用，用于存储和管理双因素代码。它是一项基于云的服务，可为你提供便利的工业级安全性。不幸的是，它不是开源的。

你会考虑在 Linux 桌面上使用更直接（和开源）的身份验证器应用吗？

嗯，当然，你不能使用云同步。但是你可以为双因素身份验证码做个备份。记住这点，让我告诉你更多有关 Authenticator 的信息。



Authenticator：生成双因素身份验证代码

当你启用在线服务的双因素身份验证时，大多数服务都会为你提供令牌/QR 码，你可以添加/扫描以生成代码。

Authenticator 就是这样一款适用于 Linux 的应用，他可让你添加双因素身份验证码。



它是一个自由开源的应用，具有添加各种支持双因素身份验证的令牌和网站的基本功能。

身份验证器的特点



你获得的一些基本功能包括：


使用相机或截图的二维码扫描器

使用密码保护应用

自动锁定应用

支持各种算法（SHA-1/SHA-256/SHA-512）

支持基于时间/基于计数器/流式计算方法

备份/恢复选项（FreeOTP、Aegis 和 OTP、Bitwarden 和 Google Authenticator）


你可以设置自定义选项，并能够根据服务提供的支持添加自定义的提供者。可以为提供者添加自定义图标，以帮助你区分身份验证代码。



在大多数情况下，默认设置应该适用于网站。但是，如果它不起作用，你可能需要与提供者核实确切的详细信息。

该应用还具有开箱即用的多个提供者，例如 Google Drive 和 Proton Mail。因此，你无需为添加的每个条目添加自定义配置。

在 Linux 上安装 Authenticator



Authenticator 以 Flatpak 的形式提供。因此，你可以将它安装在任何 Linux 发行版上。

只需输入以下命令即可安装它：

flatpak install flathub com.belmoussaoui.Authenticator


你可以前往其 Flathub 或 GitLab 页面探索更多信息。

如果你是 Linux 世界的新手，请参阅我们的 Flatpak 指南 进行设置。你的软件中心可能已经启用了 Flatpak 集成。这种情况下，你可以搜索安装它。

使用开源身份验证器应用确保安全性和可靠性

我们经常依赖云驱动的工具来处理所有事情。当然，这很方便。

但是，有时桌面应用更有用。如果你也这么想并考虑进行转换，Authenticator 可能是一款值得安装的出色的应用，可以用于双因素身份验证码。

                              <span>PowerShell（也可写作 pwsh）是一个功能强大的开源命令行工具，它是面向对象的，由微软开发和维护。它的语法特征冗长，但对用户来说比较直观。本文介绍如何在主机上和在 Podman 或其他容器内安装 PowerShell。

为何使用 PowerShell

PowerShell，正如它的名字那样，是一个强大的工具。它的句法冗长，但语义清晰。对那些不愿意写长命令的开发者来说，PowerShell 的大多数命令都有别名。可以使用 Get-Alias 或点击 此处 查询别名的使用方法。

PowerShell 和传统的 Shell 最大的区别在于它的输出管道。普通的 Shell 输出的是字符串或字符流，PowerShell 输出的是对象。这对命令管道的工作方式具有深远的影响，而且它具有很多的优点。

演示例子

下面的例子体现的是冗长而清晰的特点。以 # 号开头的行是注释行。以 PS &gt; 开头的行是命令行，PS &gt; 是提示符：

# Return all files greater than 50MB in the current directory.
## Longest form
PS &gt; Get-Childitem | Where-Object Length -gt 50MB
## Shortest form (with use of aliases)
PS &gt; gci | ? Length -gt 40MB
## Output looks like this

Free-speech crusader Elon Musk isn’t happy with Twitter’s years-old decision to suppress a news story about Hunter Biden’s laptop just ahead of the 2020 presidential election. So in an effort “to restore public trust” in Twitter, Musk indicated last month that he would release internal communications showing how it all went down.
That arrived Friday night in the form of a lengthy and arduously slow tweet thread (it took a full two hours to complete) from journalist Matt Taibbi, who Musk appears to have leaked the documents to and coordinated for his findings to be posted to Twitter.

Amazon’s Jeff Blackburn, who leads the company’s media and entertainment businesses, is retiring from Amazon for a second time, according to emails from Blackburn and CEO Andy Jassy on Friday. 
With Blackburn’s departure, there will be some shifts in Amazon’s org chart. Mike Hopkins, who heads up Prime Video, Amazon Studios, and MGM, will report directly to Jassy. Steve Boom will add Audible, Twitch, and Amazon’s games division to his current responsibilities overseeing the company’s music and podcasting groups. He’ll also report directly to Jassy.


Blackburn first retired from his job as SVP of business and corporate development in February 2021 after a year-long sabbatical but was back in his current role that May. Since his return,...

Amazon is offering some users a whole $2 a month for only one teeny, tiny thing in return: that they route their traffic through an Amazon server so the company can keep track of which Amazon ads they’ve seen. It’s apparently been doing this for months.
I’m not sure who needs to hear this, but you Should! Not! Do! That! 
The offer is part of Amazon’s Shopper Panel app, an “invitation-only” program that gives you up to $10 a month in Amazon credit for uploading receipts for purchases you made at places other than Amazon and filling out surveys. I’ll say again: even if you were willing to basically give up your privacy, which you probably shouldn’t be, why would you do it for just a few dollars? If there’s anything more personal than your...

Computers are fancy filing cabinets, full of virtual folders and files waiting to be referenced, cross-referenced, edited, updated, saved, copied, moved, renamed, and organized. In this article, I&#x27;ll take a look at a file manager for your Linux system.
The XFCE desktop is well-known and respected for its careful and methodical development cycle. It&#x27;s actively maintained and has continued to evolve over the years, its focus tends to be on delivering a consistent experience with just the right amount of new features. It&#x27;s a pleasure to use XFCE on everything from the old computer you&#x27;ve repurposed as a home server to the new PC you&#x27;ve just built and are too greedy to waste GPU cycles on fa…</span>

Requirements
Our Higher Order Component(HOC) should support two basic functionality for compositive usage
We can use forward Ref; React way or,
We can use document.getElementById to listen for the click
Let&#x27;s define our Interface for the props for our HOC
export interface IClickOutsideProps {

                              <span>There were several items on the agenda, this post focuses on feature proposals and their progress from the meeting that was held between 29th November to 1st December 2022
Stage 4:
Intl Enumeration API: Return supported values of options, such as timeZone, calendars, numberingSystems, currencies, units
Stage 3:
Set Methods: Proposal for new Set methods.


Explicit Resource Management: Address a common pattern in software development regarding the lifetime and management of various resources (memory, I/O, etc.).


Iterator Helpers: Methods for working with iterators.


Well-Formed Unicode Strings: Method to determine if a String is well-formed Unicode.



Stage 2:
eraDisplay option for Intl.DateTimeFormat: Intl.DateTimeFormat displays era field only if date displayed is in same era as today&#x27;s.


Async Explicit Resource Management: This proposal relates to async functionality deferred from the original Explicit Resource Management proposal and shares the same motivation.


ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer: This proposal is spun out of the resizable buffer&#x27;s proposal.



Stage 1:
Mass Proxy Revocation: Proposal for revoking proxies en masse.


Intl Era and MonthCode: To specify necessary details about era, eraYear and monthCode usage with Temporal in internationalization setting (for calendars other than &quot;iso8601&quot;).


Intl.MessageResource: This proposal aims to make it easier to localize the web, increasing the openness and accessibility of the web for speakers of all languages.

How many times have you wrote the backend API then the Frontend API Layer then the docs, Normally thats 3 peoples jobs or one if you are unlucky, but then you and the team have to keep that all up to date, its not easy, actually its a big bottleneck in development time and therefore cost.
So what if we could just sit down together and write a single yaml, human readable file that anyone could understand. A file single powerful file that could generate the server code for our chosen language/framework, the client code and the docs all in one central location, if you think about it, this makes perfect sense and what a time saver... That is OpenAPI

With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, finding a deal on an M1-equipped MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult. It’s sometimes a slightly different story for the MacBook Pros with the beefier M1 Pro and M1 Max CPUs, but any savings you can get on those Pro models is sure to be worthwhile.

Motorola is making its high-end Edge 30 Fusion available in the US for the first time in a bold, new color option.

The Edge 30 Fusion comes with upper-midrange specs, including a previous-gen flagship Qualcomm processor, the Snapdragon 888 Plus 5G.

Those of us who support open source project communities are often asked about usage metrics — a lot. The goal of these metrics is usually to demonstrate the software&#x27;s importance as measured by its user base and awareness. We typically want to know: how many people use the software, how many installations are there, and how many lives are being touched.
To make a long story short: We cannot answer these questions directly.
Sorry to disappoint you if you were hoping for a definitive solution. No one has the perfect answers to questions about usage metrics. At least, no precise answers.
The good news is that there are approximations and alternative metrics that can satisfy your thirst for k…</span>

Computers are fancy filing cabinets, full of virtual folders and files waiting to be referenced, cross-referenced, edited, updated, saved, copied, moved, renamed, and organized. In this article, we&#x27;re taking a look at a file manager for your Linux system.
At the tail end of the Sun Microsystem days, there was something called the Java Desktop System, which was strangely not written in Java. Instead, it was a (according to sun.com at the time) &quot;judicious selection of integrated and tuned desktop software, most based on open source and open standards.&quot; It was based on GNOME, with an office suite, email and calendaring apps, instant messaging, &quot;and Java technology.&quot; I found myself musing about what it would …</span>

谷歌称，“在过去几年/版本中，内存安全漏洞的数量大幅下降。”每年的内存安全漏洞数量从 2019 年的 223 个下降到 2022 年的 85 个。Android 13 是第一个该版本中加入的大部分新代码都是内存安全语言的安卓版本，Rust 在 Android 13 所有新的原生代码中占 21%。在整个 Android 12 和 13 系统中，“在安卓的 Rust 代码中发现的内存安全漏洞为零”。

OpenAI 发布了一个通用的聊天机器人原型 ChatGPT，可以以更像人类的方式和用户对话。虽然这种聊天机器人本质上是 “随机鹦鹉”，它们的知识仅仅来自于训练数据中的统计规律，而不是像人类那样对世界这个复杂而抽象的系统的理解。但有人用编码问题测试了它，并声称其答案是完美的。比如说，它会说“你使用的那个循环条件犯了一个严重的错误！”或者可以让它像一个聪明的黑客一样解释冒泡排序算法。

老王点评：能解释代码其实并不令人意外，要是能进一步可以帮忙审查代码就更好了。




英国年龄超过 50 岁的 IT 专家仅有 22% 

根据英国计算机协会的研究，在当地 190 万 IT 专家中，只有 22%（41.3 万）达到或超过 50 岁，而英国其他就业领域中 50 岁以上的平均人数约为 56.1万。另外，老年技术人员的时薪中位数为 25 英镑，比整个 IT 专家群体的时薪高 14%。

                              <span>Git 的 bisect 工具通过快速识别坏的提交，节省了时间和精力。


你是不是有过这样的经历：发现代码中有 错误bug，但不知道这个错误是什么时候引入的。这有可能是因为，某个人提交了一份有错误的代码，但没有在他的 Git 提交commit 消息中声明它。这个错误可能已经存在了几周、几个月甚至几年，这意味着你需要搜索数百或数千个提交，才能找到问题何时出现的。而 git bisect 命令能够完美地解决这个问题！

git bisect 命令是一个强大的工具。你可以给 git bisect 命令一个范围，一端是一个已知的好状态，另一端是一个已知的坏状态。它会自动地确认当前范围的中点，在这个中点上进行测试，然后要求你确定那次提交是一个 好提交good commit 还是一个 坏提交bad commit，然后它会重复这一“二分查找”的过程，直到你找到首次引入错误的那一次提交。



这个“数学”工具是利用“二分查找”来找到错误之处的。git bisect 命令通过查看中点，然后由你来决定它是提交列表的新起点（即 “坏提交” ）还是新终点（即 “好提交”），进而来缩小查找范围，如此在几次查找中你可以就能定位到有错误的提交。即使你有 10,000 个提交要检查，最多只需要 13 次查找，就能很快地定位到首次引入错误的提交。


提交 1 坏  提交 10,000 好 &#x3D;&gt; 提交 5,000 是坏的

提交 5,000 坏  提交 10,000 好 &#x3D;&gt; 提交 7,500 是好的

提交 5,000 坏  提交 7,500 好 &#x3D;&gt; 提交 6,250 是好的

提交 5,000 坏  提交 6,250 好 &#x3D;&gt; 提交 5,625 是坏的

提交 5,625 坏  提交 6,250 好 &#x3D;&gt; 提交 5,938 是坏的

提交 5,938 坏  提交 6,250 好 &#x3D;&gt; 提交 6,094 是好的

提交 5,938 坏  提交 6,094 好 &#x3D;&gt; 提交 6,016 是坏的

提交 6,016 坏  提交 6,094 好 &#x3D;&gt; 提交 6,055 是好的

提交 6,016 坏  提交 6,055 好 &#x3D;&gt; 提交 6,036 是坏的

提交 6,036 坏  提交 6,055 好 &#x3D;&gt; 提交 6,046 是坏的

提交 6,046 坏  提交 6,055 好 &#x3D;&gt; 提交 6,050 是坏的

提交 6,050 坏  提交 6,055 好 &#x3D;&gt; 提交 6,053 是好的

提交 6,053 坏  提交 6,055 好 &#x3D;&gt; 提交 6,054 是好的


对于上面这个例子，我们能知道 10,000 个提交中的第一个错误提交是第 6053 次提交。对于 git bisect 命令，最多需要几分钟就能完成检索。但是如果要一个一个查找每个提交是否错误，我甚至无法想象需要多长时间。

使用 Git bisect 命令

git bisect 命令使用起来非常简单：

（LCTT 译注：使用 git bisect start 命令来进入 bisect 模式，并且该命令指定了一个检查范围。它会告诉我们一共有多少次提交，大概需要几步就可以定位到具体的提交。）

$ git bisect start
$ git bisect bad        # Git assumes you mean HEAD by default
$ git bisect good  # specify a tag or commit ID for 


Git 检查中间的提交，并等待你声明这次提交是一个好提交还是一个坏提交：

（LCTT 译注：如果某一提交是可以通过的，则使用 git bisect good 命令标记；同样地，如果某一提交不能通过，则使用 git bisect bad 命令标记。）

$ git bisect good


或

$ git bisect bad


然后，git bisect 工具重复检查好提交和坏提交中间的那次提交，直到你告诉它：

$ git bisect reset


一些高级用户甚至可以自己编写脚本，来确定提交的好坏状态、并在找到特定提交时采取某一补救措施。你可能不会每天都使用 git bisect 命令，但当你需要它来定位首次引入错误的提交时，它会是一个很有用的救星。

When the holidays roll around each year, you&#x27;ll encounter some wonderful gift-giving guides for physical gifts. But how about intangible gifts? Some of the most meaningful gifts are intangible ones. Let me plant some ideas in your head in that regard, and explain how intangible gifts fit in perfectly with the open source way.
Growing up, my parents established an ethic for our family: &quot;We fix things, build things, and take agency upon the world,&quot; became our family&#x27;s motto. My dad, a trained pharmacist and the chief medical supply officer for UNICEF, would routinely do carpentry, car maintenance, plumbing, and electrical work at our house. My dad once used a paper clip to fix his broken-down VW…</span>

Computers are basically fancy file cabinets, full of folders and files waiting to be referenced, cross-referenced, edited, updated, saved, copied, moved, renamed, and organized. Of course, the files and folders are only virtual, and so software developers came up with the modern &quot;desktop&quot; user interface. Your screen is the top of your &quot;desk,&quot; which you can use as a surface for taking out files from their folders so you can review and work on them. The analogy seems almost quaint these days because computers are so much more than just a filing cabinet. And yet the model remains, for many of us, as the primary way we interact with data on our personal computers, which makes humble file manager…</span>

                              <span>在 Arch Linux 及其衍生版中安装 OpenOffice 的初学者指南。


OpenOffice 是最古老的自由开源的办公生产力套件，已经维护了一段时间。它是由 Apache 开发，尽管它已经被分叉为 LibreOffice，但仍然是一个受欢迎的套件。

本教程适用于那些想要安装 OpenOffice 以满足工作和其他需要的人。

注意：在安装之前，请记住许多更新的功能和与微软 Office 的兼容性在 OpenOffice 中并未得到完全支持。如果你想要更现代的 Office 套件版本，请尝试 LibreOffice。

在 Arch Linux 中安装 OpenOffice

OpenOffice 软件包 在 Arch 用户仓库中可用。因此，要安装它，你需要使用 AUR 助手程序。这是你需要做的。按照下面提到的步骤安装 Yay AUR 助手。如果你想了解有关 Yay 的更多信息，请参阅 此处提供 的详细指南。

依次运行以下命令来安装基本包并克隆 Yay：

sudo pacman -S base-develsudo pacman -S gitcd /optsudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git


通过将 debugpoint 替换为你的 Arch 系统的用户名来运行以下命令：

sudo chown -R debugpoint:users ./yay


最后，使用以下命令安装 AUR 助手：

cd yaymakepkg -si


完成后，使用以下命令安装 OpenOffice：

yay -S openoffice-bin




按照屏幕上的说明进行操作。安装后，你可以在应用菜单中找到它，如下图所示。

启动 OpenOffice 并将你的姓名和详细信息添加到启动向导中，你就可以使用了。





总结

使用上述方法，你还可以在 Majnaro 和其他基于 Arch Linux 的发行版中安装 OpenOffice。尽管它是一个较旧的办公生产力套件，但你应该记住，它并不完全兼容现代微软 Office 文档类型（例如 docx、xlsx）。

如果你在安装过程中遇到任何错误，请在下面的评论栏中给我们留言。

Mastodon 的安全性并不可靠

自从 Twitter 被收购后，Mastodon 引来了大量注意，用户数量激增，两周内总用户达到 870 万。有安全专家发现多个存在安全漏洞的 Mastodon 实例。Mastodon 项目缺乏专门的安全团队，甚至软件也没有自动更新或检查更新的功能。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：随着用户增多，安全问题就成了大问题，好在 Mastodon 本身并不收集太多用户数据。




Let&#x27;s Encrypt 签发了逾三十亿证书

目前全球有数以百万计的网站依赖 Let&#x27;s Encrypt 作为安全保障。其 2022 年年度报告中称，截至 2022 年 11 月 1 日，它为超过 3.09 亿个域名提供了证书，仅 2022 年增加了逾 3300 万个域名。Let&#x27;s Encrypt 在 2017 年 6 月签发了第一亿个证书。三年后的 2020 年 2 月签发了第 10 亿个证书。

                              <span>埃隆·马斯克证实，加密私信即将到来! 这是好东西。




今年早些时候，埃隆·马斯克 在 Twitter 上表示：Twitter 的 私信Direct Messages（DM）需要像 Signal 协议这样的 端到端加密End-to-End Encryption。

早在 2016 年，爱德华·斯诺登就 要求 Twitter 的前首席执行官兼联合创始人杰克·多尔西添加 Signal 协议类似的安全措施到 Twitter 平台。

但是，这个协议从来没有被添加到 Twitter。它可能经过测试但还未部署实施。

根据最近的公告，Twitter 似乎即将实现这个安全协议 😌。

马斯克分享了他在公司演讲中的几张幻灯片，其中就包括为 Twitter 2.0 路线图规划的“加密私信”。

🔒 Twitter 通信的 Signal 协议



虽然有一些安全研究员，例如 黄文津，已经在 Twitter 的 iOS 和 Android 应用程序中发现了对 Signal 协议 的代码引用。

但是直到现在，埃隆·马斯克才在 推文 中确认了该计划，该推文介绍了根据 “Twitter 2.0” 路线图将对 Twitter 平台进行的改进。

换句话说，埃隆·马斯克正式确认 Twitter 即将推出加密私信。



对于那些不知道 Signal 协议的人，我们简要地介绍一下 Signal 协议：Signal 协议是一种开源的加密协议，它允许以 完全前向保密perfect forward secrecy（PFS）方式实施端到端加密。

该协议使用 “双棘轮算法Double Ratchet algorithm”，通信双方根据不断变化的共享密钥，来交换加密的消息。

这确保没有第三方可以得到通信消息的内容，因为共享密钥仅存在于通信双方的设备上。

Signal 应用程序充分利用了这个方法。但是，进一步来说，还有几个以隐私为中心的替代方案：

（LCTT 译注：Signal 协议是一种真正的端到端加密的通讯协议，号称是世界上最安全的通讯协议。只有参与通讯的用户可以读取并解密信息，而任何第三方（包括服务器）都无法查看到通讯的内容。总的来说，它可以防止潜在的窃听者（包括：通信服务商、互联网服务提供商甚至是该通讯系统的提供者），获取能够用以解密通讯内容的密钥。目前有大量即时通讯软件也使用或借鉴参考了 Signal 协议，例如：Skype、What&#x27;sApp、Facebook Messenger）

Signal 协议如何帮助 Twitter DM？

它可以防止恶意攻击者和政府去窥探 Twitter 用户的消息，从而使 Twitter 成为一个更加安全的平台。

Twitter 添加加密私信会对举报人、记者和社会活动家有益，因为他们经常会因其工作而面临被审查或成为攻击目标。

诚然，就隐私而言，加密私信可能不是最严格的保护措施。但有总比没有好。

🔏 加密消息应该成为通讯软件的标准

在这个动荡的信息时代，我们看到更多的恶意攻击者试图未经授权访问敏感信息。

端到端加密应成为所有通讯软件的必要标准，我希望 Twitter 能够尽快添加它。

                              <span>可根据自然语言指令进行《我的世界》游戏的 AI

英伟达最近发布的一篇论文，披露了其为《我的世界》游戏训练的通用 AI 代理 MineDojo。研究人员给它输入了 73 万个 YouTube 视频（转录了超过 22 亿字），抓取了 7000 个维基网页，以及 34 万个 Reddit 帖子和 660 万条评论。人们可以用高级自然语言告诉 MineDojo 代理在游戏中做什么。不同于其它为电子游戏开发的 AI，它们往往只擅长特定的任务，研究人员开发了一个可扩展的训练框架，能够成功执行各种开放式任务的通用代理。

老王点评：能根据自然语言进行游戏，这距离通用 AI 更进一步了。




GPT-3 可以写押韵的诗歌和歌词

OpenAI 宣布了 GPT-3 的一个新模型，人们发现它可以生成押韵的歌曲、打油诗和诗歌，而这是 GPT-3 以前无法产生的水平。用机器生成诗歌并不新鲜，甚至早在 1845 年，发明家们就已经在想办法通过自动化来写出有表现力的诗句。但是，专家们特别指出，GPT-3 的最新模型可以将有关各种主题和风格的知识整合到一个能写出连贯文字的模型中。

老王点评：AI 甚至可以写押韵的诗歌，比那些下三路诗歌强了不止一点。




API 安全漏洞成为大量泄露数据的重要风险

恶意行为者利用 2021 年 12 月披露的一个 API 漏洞，获得了超过 540 万 Twitter 用户的数据。报告称，在过去 12 个月里，95% 的企业在生产用的 API 中遇到了安全问题，20% 的企业由于 API 中的安全漏洞而遭受数据泄露。API 攻击的一个不幸的现实是，这些系统的漏洞提供了对前所未有的数据量的访问。


消息来源：Venture Beat



老王点评：API 是一道通向内部的门，而设计一个完善安全的 API 的重要性，往往被人忽视。</span>

Eugen Rochko just reported that the social service Mastodon had &quot;hit 1,028,362 monthly active users […] 1,124 new Mastodon servers since Oct 27 and 489,003 new users&quot;. Known mainly by open source developers, Mastodon has suddenly become mainstream, promising to take inclusive, open, and free values to social media. If Mastodon was sustainable, it is now thriving, attracting both users and developers, and able to launch more than 1,000 servers in a matter of days. How can this increase in users and infrastructure be explained? In this article, we want to suggest that there are different kinds of sustainability in open source and that these can have interesting interactions.

In programming, iteration is an important concept because code often must scan over a set of data several times so that it can process each item individually. Control structures enable you to direct the flow of the program based on conditions that are often established dynamically as the program is running. Different languages provide different controls, and in Lua, there&#x27;s the while loop, for loop, and repeat until loop. This article covers for loops. I will cover while and repeat until loops in a separate article.
For loop
A for loop takes a known quantity of items and ensures that each item is processed. An &quot;item&quot; can be a number. It can also be a table containing several entries or any Lua data typ…</span>

In my previous article, I introduced the open source test tool JMeter and used a simple HTTP test as an example to demonstrate its capabilities. This article shows you how to build test scripts for complex test scenarios.
The user interface displays a JMeter test script in the &quot;tree&quot; format. The saved test script (in the .jmx format) is XML. The JMeter script tree treats a test plan as the root node, and the test plan includes all test components. In the test plan, you can configure user-defined variables called by components throughout the entire test plan. Variables can also thread group behavior, library files used in the test, and so on. You can build rich test scenarios using various test comp…</span>

21 年的时候曾写过 一篇文章 分享了自己的知识管理方案，其中我将个人数据都存储在了第三方服务上。虽然第三方的服务很好用，但终究存在关服或无法访问导致的数据丢失风险，始终让我感到不放心；同时数据散落在各处，也没法进行统一备份管理、数据应用和数据可视化。
本着数据拿在自己手上才算安全的原则，同时也期望将数据汇聚在一起进行统一的访问存取使用，我动手构建了一套自己的数据中心解决方案，实现了对现有使用中的第三方数据服务的采集，以及数据采集以后的应用和可视化功能。在此基础上我还开发了一些属于我自己的数据产品，将某些不方便采集的第三方服务替代掉。

系统架构
本文将以阅读记录数据为例，分享系统的架构设计和技术选型，为大家提供一种方案思路，具体的实现方案可以参考文末的开发文档，关键的系统代码也都将开源，以供大家进行复现。

我首先将服务划分为第三方服务和部署在自己系统上的私有服务两类，系统架构的后端主要包括数据存储、定时任务调度、后端接口和报表系统四个模块。客户端的话使用微信机器人和 Web 服务，保证手机端和 PC 端都能直接访问。
对于数据中心来说最核心的部分就是数据存储了。在最开始的时候只是单纯的想备份各个平台上的数据，所以直接简单粗暴地存储为 CSV 文件，使用 Pandas 来进行数据处理。但到后来我又想进一步增加可视化和即席查询的需求时就感到很不方便了，最终还是上了 MySQL。
为了便于未来服务器到期时数据库环境的迁移，我将 MySQL 安装在一个 docker 容器里，缺点就是对我那台已经部署了多个服务的 1 核 2G 的服…</span>

                              <span>OPTION-O Lagom mini 是一群澳洲的咖啡爱好者工程师在 2016 年决定结合自己的工作技能和爱好技能打造的产品，是近年来比较流行的创业故事。
Lagom mini 首先在外形上就和传统磨豆机大相径庭，许多网红磨豆机是把磨豆机的颜值提升到了极致，但你还是能一眼看出来这是个磨豆机，调节转盘、豆仓、方方正正的造型，该有的都有。而 Lagom mini 则是三个有着浓郁 「苹果范」 的铝合金圆柱体，不管是银色的铝合金光泽还是 CNC 痕迹都像极了 Mac 电脑，圆柱体中集成了刀盘调节装置 —— 圆柱中裂出的一条缝，如果不仔细看，就是三个矗立在那的银色圆柱。

同时也得益于高度集成的设计，Lagom mini 体积极小，抛开大的不和谐的电源，Lagom mini 的机身比手摇磨豆机大不了多少，或者说这就是一个有着电机驱动和更稳定结构的手摇磨豆机，就像 Mac mini，比 MacBook / 手摇磨豆机大一点，你还需要外接电源工作，但你确实可以将它们带出房间，而不是像传统台式机和电动磨豆机那样局限在房屋里，在 Glamping 火热的当下，这个优点极其突出。

致敬苹果的不仅是外观设计，还有对磁铁的运用，接粉罐和底座通过磁吸连接，只要放过去就能自动归位，让出粉口对准罐子，避免撒漏。还有豆仓盖也是嵌入了磁铁，放进豆子，盖子也是自动归位，非常巧妙的设计。

还是因为出色的结构设计，Lagom mini 调节简单，最大的圆柱体其实是由两部分组成，拧动调节间距挤压上下刀盘的距离就能调节磨豆的粗细，从意式到手冲到法压壶都能胜任，不过不推荐意式，为啥放缺点那讲。

作为一台磨豆机，其核心当然是高精度、稳定、均匀的研磨，和所有定量设备一样，只要想做到稳定的高精度，其难度和成本必然是成几何级增长的，这也是比 200 块的磨豆机优秀的地方。Lagom mini 的 48mm 锥刀粒径分布均匀，我大概的用筛网筛了一下，极细粉少多了，最多的中间粉颗粒分布也均匀，能让做出的咖啡风味更稳定，不会一次酸一次苦的。
冲煮前后的咖啡粉
Lagom mini 的一大特色是 「零残粉」，它的出粉通道设计的很巧妙，在锥刀下有三扇摆动叶片，随着锥刀一同旋转将磨碎掉落下的咖啡粉扫到出粉口掉出，将出粉通道缩减到最小，这样就几乎没有残粉了，根据我的试验，正常情况下进豆和出粉的重量差一般都在 0.1 克内。
如果你还不满意，可以和我一样购置一个 3D 打印的吹粉豆仓盖，用按压吹一吹，不过由于接粉罐很小，30 克豆子就有溢出的风险了，如果再一吹，就很容易吹的到处都是，如果 Lagom mini 能把接粉罐的直径做大一圈，同时让出粉口内插进去而不是像现在这样出粉口悬浮在接粉罐上沿 2mm 的位置，完全杜绝散落就完美了。

目前看，吹气豆仓在吹残粉有咖啡粉漫天飞舞的隐患，而小拨片和老式的敲打都不够优雅，可能泰摩那扭一扭的机关扳手才是完美形态吧。
除开以上，Lagom mini 最大的问题是静电消除不够好，大概是全金属机身的天生缺陷吧，每次磨完豆子，豆仓内一定会遗留大量的银皮粉屑混合物，丢失的 0.1 克大概就在这吧。如果用喷水老办法能缓解一部分，不过会带来新问题 —— 豆子粘在豆仓壁上下不去，甚至是直接卡在颈口，就很尴尬，每次磨完都得打开瞅一瞅。

再吹毛求疵点，一是硕大的电源能不能小型化一点，不知道的还以为是老款 MacBook Pro 的电源呢，如果能改成 C 口支持移动电源直驱就更完美了。二是磨豆速度有点慢，磨 20 克豆子能要个小一分钟，如果是磨 Espresso 的细度，那得到地老天荒。

满分的话，我能给 Lagom mini 打上个 86 分，足够跨入优秀磨豆机的行列，只是优秀如鲠在喉的小问题让你用的没那么顺畅，作为初创团队的首款作品还是值得赞扬的，希望二代能保留优点改进不足，让家用磨豆机市场更卷一点。</span>

Most computer commands consist of two parts: The command and arguments. The command is the program meant to be executed, while the arguments might be command options or user input. Without this structure, a user would have to edit the command&#x27;s code just to change the data that the command processes. Imagine rewriting the printf command just to get your computer to greet you with a &quot;hello world&quot; message. Arguments are vital to interactive computing, and the Lua programming language provides the {…​} expression to encapsulate varargs given at the time of launching a Lua script.
Use arguments in Lua
Almost every command given to a computer assumes an argument, even if it expects the argument to be an empty list. Lua r…</span>

在宣传片制作课的最后一个视频，老师留下了这段让我印象深刻的话，以此为契机，我也写出了自己在宣传片主题的第一篇 教程文章。
在此之前，因为对宣传片的设计感兴趣，我注册学习了资深宣传片制作人 Derek Lieu 的 宣传片制作课，在过往养成的知识管理习惯的帮助下，课程中的所学也顺利进入了我的知识库，变成了一篇篇的笔记。
成堆的笔记令人安心，我甚至用一个周末重新梳理了这些笔记，将它们分门别类、放在了目录索引中，但直到某一刻，我突然感觉这样下去是不行的，我想起了 Derek Lieu 在课程结尾说过的话，意识到自己依然停留在「持续学习」的舒适圈中，没有最终的实践，我就还算不上掌握自己所学的东西。
我在笔记软件 Obsidian 里攒上了一堆宣传片的笔记
显然，我需要创造实践的机会，但具体应该做些什么？我的脑海中蹦出了两个选择，一个是制作宣传片，另一个是写文章。
我最终选择了后者，因为我清楚自己学宣传片并不是为了制作、而是为了借此帮更多人做好宣传片，让好的游戏被更多人看到，而且文章是我更熟悉的创作形式，可以更快的启动、预期的产出速度也更快，这意味着我可以更快的获取反馈，从而学得更快。
但当我真的开始做这件事，我才发现这比想象得要难，有 3 个问题摆在了我的面前：

有太多想写的文章主题，每一个都想写
在宣传片这一主题下，我此前从未写过原创的教程文章，很担心表达会太硬核、劝退读者
我并没有实际的宣传片制作经验，很难不怀疑仅靠这种半吊子自学，能写出多少有价值的内容

不过这篇文章能发出来，也说明我最终或多或少解决了这些问题、写完了文章，至于我是怎么做的，这就来说一说。
选题
正如开头所说，在动笔之前，我面临的第一个问题是潜在选题太多。
我日常会在效率软件 Notion 里管理自己的创作选题，每当有想写的文章选题时，我就会临时…</span>

你可以先回忆一下，在你目前的人生阶段里，让你有明显成长的三件事是什么？
不用现在立刻给我答案，我也准备了我的答案在文章最后，等你看完文章我们可以一起对一下。
不管你的答案是什么，我猜想，你的成长时刻一定存在着「他者」，这个「他者」也许是对你来说重要的人，也许只是一个陌生人的一句话，或者是某个概念或某种信念。但是他们的共同点是：具备否定性。
很多人都说，当有人否定我们的时候，我们应该想办法回击，因为我们需要「正能量」。但是，如果在一个团体里，大家全部都是相互夸赞，充满正能量，那么它很可能落入了充满虚假肯定性的陷阱里。
信息的同质化
我们总会忘记回看之前收藏的文章和视频。
在《囤积癖：为何我们收藏很多，却毫无进步》1 里说，微信里的文章收藏、读书软件里的划线笔记、豆瓣里的待读清单，我们总是会囤积一些自己无法消化的内容，然后产生了一种“我已经看过的”错觉。
「知晓」并不等于「知道」，我们收藏的未消化的信息越多，内心的压力也就越大，而去主动学习和消化的动力就越小，直到曾费心收藏的内容被遗忘掉。而不断地切换和遗忘，造成了时间的徒然浪费。这还是文字，更遑论视频。
在视频平台上，我们都无法对其中有价值的内容进行复制和粘贴，对于视频内容的消化和吸收的门槛更高了。但是，我们点赞收藏的行为门槛却更低。我们能做的只有点赞和收藏，双击就能点赞，产品设计让行为门槛极低，其初衷并非是帮助你更好地学习，而是让你贡献数据。
因此在算法推荐下，我的点赞、停留时长、收藏等下意识行为，成为了数据养分。这样一来，我们会看到更多自己能够快速接受和喜欢的内容，自然地过滤掉与…</span>

作为一个拥有多台 Mac 的用户，电脑中诸多软件配置同步的问题一直困扰着我。
近年来软件功能越来越丰富，但是设置步骤也逐渐繁琐。虽然很多软件推出了自己的云同步服务，只需要登陆账号就可以在多台设备中同步设置。但是仍旧有多数软件并没有多设备间的同步功能，如何解决这一软件之间同步成了一个课题。本文抛砖引玉，使用开源软件 mackup 对设备中无法进行云同步的软件进行配置的备份与还原。
使用 Mackup

Mackup 是一款基于 python，适用于 Linux/macOS 的命令行备份软件，只需要简单输入几行命令，就可以把应用程序的配置文件备份或还原。Mackup 支持目前市面上主流的云存储，比如 Dropbox、iCloud、OneDrive 等等，通过将备份文件存储到云存储中，再在另一台电脑上还原的方式同步配置。
我们以在 macOS 下备份 Raycast 配置为例：
安装 Mackup
Mackup 提供了 brew 与 pip 两种安装方式，我们可以通过以下命令安装：
brew install mackup 
# 使用 brew 安装

pip install --upgrade mackup
# 使用 pip 安装
配置
安装完成之后我们需要对与 mackup 进行配置，mackup 的配置文件为 ~/.mackup.cfg ，我们可以通过 vi 或者nano 进行编辑
vi ~/.mackup.cfg
在配置文件中我们首先需要选择使用的存储备份方式（默认为 Dropbox），我们使用 iCloud:

近期做了工作的调整，离职前和团队做了一些经验分享和自我的反思，作为自己的告别礼物。未曾想老东家做内部培训的同事在听闻这件事之后，联系到我希望我可以聊聊离职前的感受（可能很少有工作十年的中年人会坦然地向上下级谈自己的欠缺或不足，即便是即将离职的人），索性便有了这篇文章。希望自省的同时也可以提供一些包括但不限于工作习惯，职场心态和自我规划的建议。
笔者过去工作经验均在传统机械行业，所思所想会有一定的局限性，还请批判性阅读，择其善者而从之。
主动沟通
刚工作的时候，笔者自忖是一个乐观主动的人，从未想过自己在工作的时候可以如此「内向」：经常遇到了问题会卡在那里默默思考和钻研，看起来很努力，实际上却数日毫无进展，直到临近交付节点才会意识到问题的严重性，最终使自己日渐焦虑。直到汇报前才向直线领导坦承自己无法搞定一份材料且没有临时解决方案。
这时候领导的一句话让我茅塞顿开：这个任务并不是让你一个人完成，你要学会去和相关方沟通，调动资源。实际上，我也不清楚这份材料里的数据如何得出来，但我相信可以通过项目经理那边拿到解释相关数据的人名单。
这件事之后，便明白了主动沟通的必要性：遇到不确定或者不明白的事情，主动问询并不丢脸。反而能够让你用最短的时间更加深度了解事件原委，而非像我一样把事情积压在自己手里，硬生生把大家的工作变成了自己的问题。但在问别人问题之前也需要要求自己从自我专业的角度做出合理的理解和判断，而非诸事仰赖他人。
而对于经常要做汇报的职场人，总是不可避免的会涉及的其他业务相关方。那么建议在向更高级领导汇报前可以事前和相关方进行沟通，以…</span>

引言
AI 数字绘画技术的发展历程
最近一年多的时间里 AI 技术凭借大模型和新的算法在诸多领域产生了可见的突破性进展，对于普通人而言基于 AI 的图像处理和文本处理技术已经逐步改变了我们的生活。AI 绘画技术悄然兴起然后受到广泛的关注，这是一个如此典型的范例一方面让我们感受到了 AI 的强大，另一方面又不得不重新思考我们与 AI 的关系：我们是不是马上会被技术替代了？
首先来看看这一波 AI 绘画技术发展的历程：

2021 年 1 月，OpenAI 公布了 DALL-E，奠定了扩散模型在这一波技术发展中的重要性。
2021 年 10 月，开源的文本生成图像工具 disco-diffusion 诞生，此后有相当多的基于此的产品出现。
2022 年 7 月，OpenAI 旗下人工智能在线绘图应用 DALL·E 2 公测。
2022 年 8 月，stability.ai 开源了stable-diffusion，这是目前可用性最高的开源模型，很多商业产品都基于此，如 NovelAI。10 月 18 日，Stability.ai 宣布完成 1.01 亿美金的种子轮融资，估值达 10 亿美金。

自从几个重要的开源模型发布以来，基于次开发的一些门槛较低的 AI 绘画生成平台多次在社交网络上爆红，早几个月的 Midjourney 以及近期国内发布的意间 AI 等产品吸引了众多没有技术背景的素人参与 AI 创作和讨论，并开启了诸多商业渠道的流量密码。

家有一猫，叫咪咪。傻乎乎的，每天除了吃饭就是睡觉，好吃懒做也不学习，甚至连猫叫都不会。可能正是因为它不会猫叫，有强烈的自卑情绪，生活态度非常消极，日渐肥胖。为了让一只不会喵喵叫的小猫咪积极面对生活，我们决定用宠物交流按钮来代替猫叫，让咪咪学会「说话」。
教学理念
受启发于 狗狗Bunny 和 B 站的一只猫咪叫 福福 ，他们能用不同的按钮发声去表达自己的需求。我们也打算采用同样的方法，训练小猫咪通过按压不同按钮后发出的「吃饭」、「开门」、「贴贴」等不同声音来表达自己当下的需求。
整个学习过程的基本原理是条件反射，条件反射分为经典条件反射和操作性条件反射。经典条件反射，最有名的例子便是巴浦洛夫的狗。在每次给予食物前，先播放一段铃声，反复多次后，狗狗便学会了将铃声（条件刺激）和奖励（食物）之间建立联系。操作性条件反射，最早是由新行为主义代表人物斯金纳提出，在斯金纳箱（一个带有操作杆的箱子）中探索的实验小鼠需要将主动按压操作杆（动作）和获得奖励（食物）之间建立联系。操作性条件反射是将主动行为与奖励建立联系，而经典条件反射是将被动听到的铃声刺激与奖励建立联系，学习过程更为简单。另外，条件刺激（按压操作杆/铃声）与非条件刺激（获得食物）之间的间隔时间颇为重要，间隔越短越容易建立联系。
当前案例下，需要让小猫咪建立不同按钮和不同反馈之间的联系，这本身是一个操作性条件反射。但在过去生活经历中，小猫咪已经将其他行为（例如踢饭盘）与获得猫粮相绑定，所以需要考虑消退该联系。另外，猫咪的生活环境和斯金纳箱中的小鼠不同，盒中环境简单，探索到操作杆非常…</span>

                              <span>早早的在官网预订，结果大半年才轮到我，又在转运中心呆了一个月。拿到手之后没多久京东自营店就开始卖了，而且是价格差不多的现货。感觉就像当年买了特斯拉没多久就频繁降价的吃瘪心理。不过现在这些都过去了，深度体验了一段时间之后，我想聊聊机器本身。和横空出世的特斯拉Model 3类似，这台机器有太多可以聊的内容了。
注意文章很长，且没什么可以跳过的地方。

为什么没有必要用续航和性能评价SteamDeck
在等待到货的日子里面看了很多测评，但当我实际拿到手里之后，发现测评的方向有偏差，或者说人们对这款机器的期待陷入了思维定势。
产品测评不好做
虽然我们现在习惯在购买电子产品之前先看评测，但是评测的最大问题是使用时间极短，常规升级的新产品还能简单梳理下升级点，但对于有突破性的新产品，评价往往会非常片面且不客观。更何况许多做测评的年轻人本身能力有限，无法做到面面俱到。例如以豪华内饰的汽油车为标准来评价Model3，这辆车将会是一无是处。这同样适用于SteamDeck，它的参照物并不是NS。
SteamDeck的产品定位是让人可以随时随地流畅地玩PC上的各种类型游戏，从独立小作品到年货3A大作，这个定位非常重要，后文会反复出现。拆解这个定位来看，“随时随地”意味着便携性，“流畅”意味着软硬件基础，“各种类型”则意味着整合的能力。
这算是一篇夹杂了许许多多主观想法的个人产品评价报告。
人们习惯于使用评价手机和电脑的标准去评价SteamDeck，首先是续航，接着是性能，然而对于什么是“好”的定义都差别巨大。由于母公司Valve另一款产品Steam在世界范围内的成功，所以这台主机理论上不缺乏“护航大作”。他们要做的就是把自家平台上数不清的游戏汇聚到这方寸之地，让玩家可以随时随地沉浸在各种性能需求不同、操作方式不同、对应平台不同的游戏中。讲真，但凡了解Steam的人都该清楚，这是个初见会让人茫然至…</span>

作为在智能家居领域耕耘十余年的专业设计师特别想和大家分享我的一些关于智能生活的体验和心得，趁着这次自己家里装修，根据自己的技术经验及实际需求设计了全屋智能家居系统，经过我一年时间的实际生活体验，也总结了一些经验和使用感受，我将分成几个系统单独介绍和分享。
智能暖通系统
暖通系统主要就是空调系统和地暖系统；由于我家的建筑结构和层高等问题，无法使用更方便智能控制的中央空调，所以客厅采用的是海尔的一拖一风管机空调，其他房间采用了米家的壁挂空调，海尔的空调可以使用海尔智家 app 控制，米家的空调可以使用米家 app 控制；地暖系统由于是在南方没有集中供暖，所以都是采用烧天然气的壁挂炉提供热量，各个房间有独立的温控器。
地暖系统
系统介绍
很多人不明白为什么要费劲整个智能的暖通系统，普通的暖通系统不是一样加热工作吗？其实这是很多人的误区，装智能温控系统的最大好处就是帮你省钱！很多朋友家里使用地暖的都知道，每个冬季的取暖费用是一笔很大的开支，平均的燃气费用在 1000-2000 / 月，根据不同的供暖面积以及设置的温度不同，有些甚至可能都超过 2000 的费用，导致有些家庭即使安装了地暖冬季都不敢开启使用，高昂的燃气费用阻碍了人们享受舒适生活的权利。
我自己是一个比较怕冷的人，特别是在杭州这种冬天湿冷的环境下，所以我在装修设计的时候就把地暖作为必选项，也为了让家人能生活在一个舒适的家中。之前给客户设计智能温控系统更多的是考虑方便管理控制，现在自己家里使用更多的也需要考虑使用成本等费用问题。

                              <span>前言
环保问题一直是装修中大家密切关注的重点，毕竟即使选择E1\E0\F4级材料，新家具、新柜子都会有气味不断散发出来。装修材料内部和连接处使用的胶会不断分解，散发出醛类、苯系物等挥发性有机物，它们会对人体呼吸系统以及血液系统造成影响。

所以新房通风散味除甲醛是每个家庭都重视的，我的房子次顶楼、南北通，楼前无遮挡，整体通风效果是非常好的。8月初定制柜安装完毕后，我就持续不关窗通风，10月中旬成品家具也正式入屋，后继续通风。两大新房空气污染源分别经过了3个月和一个月的连续通风，如今进入屋内的异样气味感已经明显减少了，为了确定新房的空气质量，计划开展新房空气的自测。
甲醛检测的国标方法

现在关注室内甲醛的人都知道，国标允许的室内甲醛最高浓度为0.10mg/m³，可靠的测试标准为GB/T 18204.26-2000《公共场所空气中甲醛测定方法》。
检测的原理就是让空气中的甲醛与酚试剂反应生成嗪，嗪在酸性溶液中杯高铁例子氧化形成蓝绿色化合物，根据其颜色的深浅，以分光光度计检测标准溶液后进行比色，进而给出定量的检测结果。这一方法对醛类物质有很好的选择性，结果可靠。
从化学角度来讲，这个是非常简单的测定实验，检测结果可靠的核心就是要有严格按照标准规定进行取样，吸收液配置准确，以及有计量溯源可靠的分光光度计和标准物质作为数据支撑。
即使其它检测手段能向国标检测方法的结果进行标定，那也没有分光光度法的可靠性和准确度。
分光光度法之所以准，是因为国标明确说明，仅有二氧化硫会对这方法的检测结果造成影响，一般家庭不存在二氧化硫。
室内甲醛测试的手段与经济投入
1：甲醛测试盒

甲醛测试盒就是简易版的酚试剂测试法，可以不需要分光光度计，每份测试盒内带有酚试剂吸收液，自行根据指导方法封闭房间，摆放吸收液半小时后，倒入铁酸溶液，显色后对比测试盒内附带的比色卡，以肉眼充当分光光度计，来判断颜色情况。…</span>

                              <span>最近，我在尝试使用画图思考。虽然只是简单应用，但是收获颇丰，值得梳理总结出来。 我会从电脑和本子两个方面来说说自己的实践。
电脑
电脑软件上，我来说说 Excalidraw 和 Craft 这两款应用。
Excalidraw

说到画图，Excalidraw 这个应用肯定绕不过。我在电脑上的思路梳理，知识分享，还有学习的沉淀，都在高度依赖这个应用。它是一款在线的白板软件，风格和字体偏手绘风格，我很享受在上面涂涂画画的过程。

思路梳理的时候，我会把自己的问题先写在白板上，然后自由发散，记录下现状。接下来，我会通过观察画布上的一个个关键字，去做分类的和关联的操作。在动手的过程中，很可能一些思路就已经慢慢出来。画布可以很好承载网状的思考，通过拖拽，连线，分层，让我在脑子里混乱的思绪，一步步清晰。如果看着画布上的关键字，一时没有找到解决方案，也不用着急，就安静观察，静下心来，慢慢琢磨。

和朋友分享观点或知识，我亦经常在这个白板上画图。有了白板，我们讨论问题的时候，可以把一些发散的问题记录到一个位置，等主要内容分享完之后，回头继续梳理。白板的展示方式，可以更好吸引对方的兴趣和注意力。我也经常感受到，在和别人交流过程中画图，会不知不觉，产生一个新的观点，或者对自己的思路愈发清晰。

最后说说学习的沉淀，抛开做笔记，我最喜欢的就是面对这个白板做知识的总结。写作困难的地方也许是从零开始，梳理知识应该也是。没有参考的情况下，列出知识大纲，结构化总结，是一件困难的事情。就是这种每次面对白板的梳理，让我可以更好检视自己的学习成果。同时，白板画图，使我我对分层学习，有了更直观的感受。
Craft
Craft 是一款笔记应用。这款应用好在配图和分享非常方便流畅。我在分享给朋友的一些文字上，会配上一张图片。不要小看文章或者句子的配图，这个配图如果合适，会加深对句子的印象。

除了分享的配图，我还会在学习专业书籍时，对目录大纲做一个梳理，同样会配上方便我联想记忆的图片。看目录标题，思考关联图片，搜索图片，然后上传图片到 Craft 的过程，虽然繁琐，但实在是一劳永逸的事情。我回顾知识框架的时候，一看到图片，就会很自然想到，自己当时为什么选择了这种图，这张图含义是什么，大部分都可以直接根据图片，推敲出章节标题。

找图片，激发自己使用右脑联想记忆，这个过程其实步骤很多。经常遇到找不到合适的图片来表达，在这时，我会在 Excalidraw 上画图。过程虽然花费不少时间，但是在这个思考和主动寻找关联关系的过程，其实已经在慢慢消化和记忆知识。

本子
便利贴
我把便利贴当作一个有边界的草稿纸。我在想一些细碎问题的时候，会打开便利贴画一下思路和草图，一个问题，不会超过一张便利贴去思考。举个例子，上周的茶话会，分享前，我在便利贴上圈圈点点，画出大纲和思路。随后我把便利贴揉成一团丢掉，暗示自己思路已经准备就绪。

便利贴的天然边界，和撕下来的特性，很好地辅助了我思考。生活中很多问题会突然出现，便利贴的便利性，就是良好的应对方式。它的第一页，在安静等待着你写写画画，接着被你撕下。一页便利贴没有过多的空间，这个特点，帮助我自然而然去聚焦问题的重点。
子弹笔记
为了让生活中很多琐事更有趣，我会在子弹笔记上，用画图的方式去给自己分配任务。比如，清理卧室，衣柜部分很多衣服需要清点，我就会把衣柜的实物画出来。当我清理完一部分格子，我会用荧光笔涂上颜色。
我在实践中，体会到画图的三个优点。首先是直观，无论是进度还是已经完成的程度，我一眼看上去，都有直观的感知。其次是低压力，看图片去想自己要做什么，和看清单上的文字，压力不一样。最后是愉悦感，看图的时候，因为低压力和直观，让我做事的时候心情更好。

除了通过画图拆分任务，我还使用荧光笔快速分类子弹笔记中的任务。比如，某一天傍晚，我打算采购想要购买的东西。由于子弹笔记是一般是按照流水线的方式记录要任务，我的本子上没有一个页面或者清单专门记录。

很自然地，我拿起某个颜色的荧光笔，在本子上把这几天未完成的购买任务，涂上同样的颜色。很短的时间内，我就快速把购买的东西过滤出来，然后拿出手机去一件件下单。
总结

从电脑上的画图实践，我学习到，多画图可以捋清思路。合适的配图，能加深印象。在本子上的实践，我学习到便利贴的边界能辅助快速思考。最后是，眼睛，分辨颜色和形状效率很高。
我的实践，如标题所言，确实非常简单。即便如此，这些实践也不是我自己凭空想象。《认知心理学》《游戏改变世界》《子弹整理思考术》《活用一辈子的读书笔记术》《一页纸工作整理术》，这五本书对我启发很大。学习和生活，都离不开知行合一。希望自己能够在成长的路上，多实践，多沉淀。</span>

                              <span>人要坚持一件事情真的很难，一不小心，少数派思考就鸽了一个多月。上周六我上了一次「得到」的直播，也是罗振宇老师的年度演讲策划会，在会上我提出了两个观点，在这里跟大家分享一下。
用实业心态创业，用实业思维做互联网产品
这句话其实在我脑海中已经很多年了，可能跟我之前从事的传统行业有关系。不管是做哪个行业和产品，我都非常在意它给用户提供的本质价值，比如我推销过纳米汽车清洁产品，就会一直纠结它的实际效果怎么样，不断反馈问题；我出口过弹簧钢丝，也更关注海外客户的使用反馈，了解我们的工艺跟其他国家的差距在哪里。
但互联网的兴起，好像改变了这些底层规则，因为要快、要规模、所以要免费，羊毛要出在猪身上。不知不觉，服务和产品的本质都被动摇了。我非常感恩互联网，因为这个工具和时代，让给我有了创业的机会，帮我把爱好变成了事业，但我不迷信互联网，它是一个好工具，但不是产品和服务的本质。
简单举两个例子：
今天的外卖让我们的餐饮高效便利，但餐饮的本质是菜品和味道，如果菜品难吃又不干净，你送餐的速度的再快也没有意义，我能忍一次两次，忍不了第三次。
今天的娱乐，让我们随时随地可以听音乐，看电影，但平台的争斗和互卷，让创作者无奈，让好的内容越来越少，最终变得没什么可看了。
所以，一个产品和服务，要想保持长期可持续的生命力，就要回归用户需求，用实业思维把东西夯实，夯成自己的真正壁垒，它可能会很慢，规模也不大，但它可以穿越周期，做成百年老店。接下来十年，可能是一个慢下来的新周期，这个思维就更加重要。
直播中有一个提前准备的问题，没来得及讲，我可以在这里补充一下：
当下环境，你会给准备创业的朋友哪些建议和叮嘱？
先想好怎样活下来，今天的市场更加残酷，没有红利、没有资本，用户更谨慎和挑剔。
少讲故事，如果你的业务短期内没法商业化，就要想好长期策略，比如控制成本，小步快跑等等。
别追风口，多关注细分市场的机会，关注年轻的主力消费人群，未来是创意和个性化的时代。
不要社恐，不要闭门造车，要主动联络和运用身边的一切资源。
创新不是颠覆，是将好做到优秀，再把优秀做成经典的过程
这句话不是我说的，而是来自 150 年历史的德国莱茵公司。三年前我前往德国参观了他们的公司和业务，七天行程的结束，莱茵大中华区电子电气副总裁 Jay 总结了这句话，引发了我的思考。
巧合的是，我八年前做出口业务的时候，有很多欧洲的客户，我去了解他们的背景，发现大多都是做了几十年的企业。他们都是深耕自己的领域，比如一家制造扫街刷子的公司，从塑料制刷改成钢丝刷，从扫街到扫管道，不停优化工艺，不停的延伸拓展，始终保持自己的市场地位。
而互联网时代，我们经常讲创新，讲颠覆，强调一个技术出现，就会改变一个行业，我就是这个行业的佼佼者。我们承认趋势的存在，但趋势是波浪，一旦过去了，你还要靠自己的实力去创造价值，只是这个趋势周期比较长，我们还没有真正经历和感受过低谷。
所以我后来一直思考这句话，它可能就是一个百年企业的运营真谛，不要觉得事情小，而是关注它的价值。150 年前的莱茵公司，是给蒸汽锅炉做安全认证的，因为品质不统一，操作不规范，它经常出现致命的事故，先做好这件事，保证工人的生命安全。后面再一点点拓展到更多的领域，最后形成了人人信赖的品牌。
做一份少数派的报告
虽然，以上这些海外企业的成长经历，跟我们的周期和环境有很大区别，但我依然认同这些底层的观点：把一件事情做好做透，拥有你最核心的用户群，先完成你基本的商业闭环，然后再围绕用户和市场的需求去慢慢拓展。这跟以往的互联网思维是基本相悖的，但从更高的维度和更长的周期来看，我依然相信这是正确的。
我们在直播中聊到，是不是可以整理一个具备这些特质的企业清单，讲讲他们的故事，我们可以把它叫做真正的《少数派报告》，也希望这些案例，能在寒冬之中，引领更多创业者找到自己的方向。</span>

最近一时兴起，又在从 1Password「逃离」。这次找到了一款在终端环境下运行的密码管理器 Pass，不仅开源免费，而且还能使用 PGP 算法进行加密，从各种角度来说，都是 1Password 不错的替代品。
话虽如此，单纯使用终端来管理密码始终不太方便。在几经研究之下，终于利用 Alfred 和 AppleScript 研究出可用于系统全域的自动填充系统（而不仅仅是在浏览器范围内）。
话不多说，先看疗效。

在这篇文章中，我会简单地描述如何利用 Pass 构建一个密码保险库，并尝试与 Alfred Workflow 连接起来，完成密码自动填充。
安装 Pass 并初始化保险库
注：本文着重于讲解使用 Alfred Workflow 配合 Pass 快速填充密码，因此本节内容将会较为简略。你可以在互联网搜索相关资料获取更多教程。
要安装 Pass，叫出 macOS 用户的的老朋友 Homebrew 就行。
brew install pass
由于 Pass 不利用主密码、而是 GPG 密钥对来完成保险库加密，因此这个过程中会额外安装 GnuPG。对于大部分普通用户而言，我个人推荐再额外安装诸如 GPG Suite 的密钥管理工具。你可以前往 GPG Suite 的官网 下载到 GPG Suite。
安装好 GPG Suite 之后，打开 GPG Keychain 程序，你可以看到一些密钥展示在屏幕上。

点击顶部「新建」按钮，然后填写你的姓名、电邮地址和一些额外信息。密码（Passphrase）可以不填（可以之后再设置），但…</span>

                              <span>茨威格在《人类群星闪耀时》一书中写道：

一个人生命中的最大幸运，莫过于在他的人生中途，即在他年富力强时发现了自己的人生使命。

从这个角度，我属于无敌幸运那一拨。
21 岁五脏滚烫的年纪，我就被自己的人生使命劈中了。
​我认定我的幸福是以一个旁观者的角度审视自己的人生旅途；如果居然行有余力，那以一个故事采集者的角度去记录更多普通人的一生，赋予我们卑微又炽热的生命以超越时空的伟大意义，是我责无旁贷的使命。
是的，我当时一文不名，但幻觉丰沛。

有一天，我们都会死去
尸体烂在泥土里。
死亡并不是一件特别可怕的事
可怕的是该在何处安置我们的故事呢？
有那么一天，我们的故事也会死去
一想到这些
我就克制不住的难过起来

按剧本我接下来应该奋不顾身的投入到这份伟大的事业中，或者年少成名，鲜衣怒马；也或许撞了个头破血流，终究败给了庸俗的生活。
无论结局如何，都该是一段轰轰烈烈的故事。
但我没有，我毕业就跑去上班了，而且一上上了九年。
你能明白么？就是那种人，一边很怂，担心明天的面条米饭、柴米油盐；一边又雄心壮志誓要扼住命运的脖子，像海明威笔下的那个老头一样去大海深处跟鲨鱼搏斗。
我觉得自己就是这种人，一个小心翼翼的猛士。
中途倒是有尝试启动项目，赶在 Web 时代余晖，完成了 80% 第一版本的工作。
接着女儿就出生了，过了几年昏天黑地的日子。那时还没有现在这么成熟的摸鱼技术，工作和老婆孩子都要照顾，人生使命这种事情只能往后放一放。
这一放，距离我被命运劈中过去了十六年。
但真正的爱情经得起考验，真正的使命也经得起等待。
十六年，杨过从唇红齿白变的鬓角飞霜，还是从断肠崖顶跳了下去。
十六年，这事儿一直都在我脑子里一刻不停歇的发着光。现在我变秃了，也变强了，终于可以给她一个交待。
 
这个立志于为普通人树碑立传的新产品，定名「一万年日记」。
其实比起日记，叫传记更准确一些。

键帽

GMK
老牌德国键帽厂，不过工期越拖越长，品质也有些不太稳定，但仍旧是铁王座
Tenshi 天使 「misotsu」
来自 IC 信息贴
这款键帽是由设计师misotsu（或许我们可以叫他味增酱）设计，这款键帽是他设计的第一款键帽，也是一款我认为设计得很不错的二创作品，原型是麻枝准的名作Angel Beats（天使的脉动）！
原作宣传图
这套键帽的灵感来自于剧中高人气女角色——立华奏
立华奏角色图
配色：

配色方面，选择了珠宝白、紫罗兰宝石色、豆奶白，取自角色发色和服饰颜色。以珠宝白和紫罗兰宝石色作为基调，复古点缀其中，整体观感偏冷色系。比较契合角色给人的印象，很少有表情变化，同时也非常寡言，「无心」和「冰冷」。
个性部分：

在个性键帽部分，我个人认为是中规中矩，忠于原作的设计。天使登场的羽毛和翅膀，学生服饰的领结，代表战斗能力的Hand sonic（音速手刃），七字回车设计则是Hand sonic 五代形似莲花，是因为可爱而制造的武器。而贯穿作品的暗线，跳动的心脏——女主角与男主角的羁绊，来自于男主角生前捐赠的心脏跳动在女主角的身体里，正如作品标题所示——Angel Beats（天使的脉动）！
渲染展示（仅供参考）：

金属个性：

这枚金属键帽的个性图案，是来自于角色最喜爱的食物——麻婆豆腐。
桌垫：

桌垫 Angel&#x27;s Down

桌垫 Fallen from grace
键帽信息：
材质：ABS材质
高度：原厂高度
工艺：二次成型
个人评分：5—10
对于二次创作键帽会有更高要求，这款键帽忠于原作的设计，是优点也是限制，根本上来说二次创作的作品都会出现这个问题，不过仍旧有厉害的作者能够做出超越原作的改编，这款键帽的颜色设计我觉…</span>

                              <span>前段时间，我和小助理录制了一期关于记账的播客。
我个人记账十几年，并从记账这件事中收获许多，小助理的财务状况也在记账后一点点发生改变，故而我俩一致认为记账对大部分人实现攒钱目标是一功不可没的步骤，于是商量着录了这期节目，希望能给大家分享一些关于攒钱和记账的心得与技巧。
这期播客上线后受到了极大的欢迎，不仅上了首页，收获了3万多播放，200多条互动，还有超过千次的收藏，连评论都获得了100多个赞， 这意外的热度让我非常欣慰。
我们团队有位小伙伴在听完这期播客后，认为对她有巨大帮助，并自告奋勇做这期节目的「课代表」，把节目里的干货做一个系统化的整理，然后分享给大家，下面的文字内容就来自小伙伴精心整理的【课程笔记】，希望能为大家提供到行之有效的方法。
 

一、找一个记账方式
 
记账的方式有很多，包括但不限于Excel、备忘录、各种记账app。
方式不重要，选一个习惯用的，适合自己的就行，但不要在这一步上耽搁太久。

我最一开始记账的时候，下载了一大堆记账app，光挑app就花了一个多礼拜的时间，这就很没有必要。选哪种方式都无所谓，重要的是坚持记账。
我自己偏向用Excel，因为莫名觉得记账app的操作都好复杂啊，而且我更习惯自己去分类。
更倾向用app的朋友，可以试下关哥推荐的时光序app，纯净无广，功能强大，除了记账以外，还可以用做日程提醒。
 
二、先做全年预算
有些支出是不能按月去计算的，因为它不一定每个月都有，这样可以给自己一个整体的规划目标感。
比如保费，它是年缴的；再比如国庆节收到的婚礼请柬可能就比较多，但平常的月份，这部分支出就比较少或者干脆没有。
很多人会把这些开销当成一笔意外支出，但实际上，这种情况每年都会发生，所以咱们可以提前把这部分的年预算给做好，至于到底是哪个月花的钱，就不重要了。
这种规划方式同时能帮我们更好的控制支出，也利于后期复盘。

                              <span>虽然现在多屏用户逐渐变多，但仍是小众，Windows 也并没过对多屏使用进行太多的优化。所以只好自己动手，于是有了以下一些个人自用的优化设置。
窗口出现位置优化
Windows 系统仅对多屏用户提供了简单主显示器的设置，默认情况下所有新打开的窗口都只会出现在主显示器上，即使你在使用另一个的显示器。而「基于显示器连接记住窗口位置」只能记住上次关闭时所在的屏幕，实用性并不高。

这时微软自家的 Power Toys 里的 FancyZones 就可以派上用场了，除了我们熟知的窗口布局设置外，它还可以调整窗口行为，在这里我们可以通过启用「将新创建的窗口移动到当前 活动的监视器（实验性）」来达到这一效果，美中不足的是动画不够优雅。

窗口出现的问题解决了，但任务栏上默认是显示所有屏幕上的窗口，不能让我们快速区分哪些应用是在当前屏幕下的。

为了解决该问题，如下图所示，Windows 提供了简陋的选项加让人摸不着头脑的翻译。设置后，每个屏幕下的任务栏就只显示当前屏幕下打开的窗口，更符合直觉，不过 Win + 数字 的快捷键就只能在主显示器上使用了。

内容显示优化
现在 Windows 下大部分的应用都适配高 DPI 的，少部分不支持的，也可以通过 Windows 自带的属性 - 兼容性选项来调整。

上面的设置仅解决了单个应用在高分辨率屏幕下的问题，并不能解决应用在分辨率相差太大的显示器间移动时会出现界面变形问题。这时，如果你使用的 AMD 显卡，那你可以通过启用 AMD Radeon Software 里的「超虚拟分辨率」来让低分辨率屏切换到更高的逻辑分辨率，不仅缩小的多屏间的分辨率差距，还有抗锯齿的效果。由于个人没有使用 Nvidia 和 Intel 显卡，相关选项是否存在请自行到显卡设置里翻找。

设置完成后到 Windows 设置调整下逻辑分辨率和缩放即可。

除此之外，对于我们网上冲浪必备的浏览器，它的缩放是固定的，且只有一个设置选项。不知道有没有人跟我一样两个屏幕的缩放比例是不一样的，在两个屏幕间移动浏览器时，网页内容并不会根据 DPI 而变化，导致观感割裂。在这里我推荐一个 FireFox 浏览器插件：ffreszoom，它可以实时感知屏幕宽度的变化，当宽度超过指定值时，自动调整到指定缩放比例。设置前先通过这个网站查看自己的屏幕宽度：http://whatismyscreenresolution.net/，需要将 Firefox 浏览器移动到不同显示器上刷新。

如图所示我的外屏宽度是 1728 px，笔记本内屏为 1024，所以我在两者之间随意取了一个值用于判断，若当前屏幕宽度超过 1600 px，就自动设置缩放为 1.5，也即 150%。若小于 1600 px，则使用浏览器设置里的值。两种缩放无缝切换，只会多了一个缩放的动画。由于本人没使用 Chromium 类浏览器，并没有对应的插件推荐，不过其用户这么多，应该会有类似的插件。

利用「闲置的」触摸板
不知有没有跟我一样喜欢使用笔记本键盘的，且平时一些简单的操作直接用触摸板直接操作。现在 Windows 11 已经支持自定义触摸板多指手势了，但其不能根据不同应用设置不同的手势，例如：A 软件可以用 Ctrl  + W 关闭，但 B 软件只能用 Alt + F4，同一个操作有不同的快捷键。

这时就需要第三方软件了，这里我推荐 GestureSign，界面虽然是 Windows 10 风格，但不影响使用，毕竟设置完就不用再看了。它可以为不同应用的不同快捷键键设置相同的触控手势，手势类型也不再仅限于横平竖直，可以自由发挥。同时软件也内置了一些常用的命令供选择。

上图是我的一些设置，双指一般使用系统默认就不添加上去了。其中个人最爱的是三指滑动切换标签，体验比鼠标点击更加符合人的直觉。对于频繁使用搜索启动器的我，把三指上滑指定为搜索启动器的快捷键，方便呼出。
 
对了，设置前记得把系统自带的相关手势取消掉，不然会冲突。若你仍不习惯使用触摸板，该软件也支持鼠标手势，具体可以自行下载体验。
结尾
以上便是我在使用多屏时遇到的问题，及相关解决方法，希望对多屏用户有帮助。</span>

                              <span>卡塔尔世界杯开幕式将于11月21日即下周一举行，在接下来的一段时间，将是全世界足球迷的狂欢月，无论你是不是足球迷，你都将会在各种媒体和社交网络上看到世界杯的信息，从球员的球场表现，到场外的花边新闻；有老将的“老骥伏枥，志在千里”，也有新人的横空出世；有冠军登顶后的春风得意，也有亚军距成功一步之遥却又失之交臂的遗憾……在世界杯举办的一个月里，将诞生许多热血与感动的故事，也少不了令众人津津乐道的段子，总之，这一切都让人无比期待。
世界杯赛程赛制
2022年世界杯将在中东国家卡塔尔举办，这是历史上首次在中东地区举办世界杯。
小组赛分组（来源：国际足联官网）
本届世界杯将有32支球队参加，分成8个小组。

A组：卡塔尔，厄瓜多尔，塞内加尔，荷兰
B组：英格兰，伊朗，美国，威尔士
C组：阿根廷，沙特阿拉伯，墨西哥，波兰
D组：法国，澳大利亚，丹麦，突尼斯
E组：西班牙，哥斯达黎加，德国，日本
F组：比利时，加拿大，摩洛哥，克罗地亚
G组：巴西，塞尔维亚，瑞士，喀麦隆
H组：葡萄牙，加纳，乌拉圭，韩国

世界杯31支参赛队伍由各个洲世界杯预选赛选出，其中欧洲拥有13个参赛名额，非洲5个名额，亚洲4.5个名额，南美洲4.5个名额，北美及加勒比地区3.5个名额和大洋洲0.5个名额。其中的半个名额是附加赛名额，澳大利亚和哥斯达黎加通过附加赛获得世界杯参赛资格。东道主卡塔尔自动获得参赛资格。
世界杯遵循杯赛赛制，分为小组赛和淘汰赛，与欧冠、亚冠等冠军联赛不同，世界杯小组赛为单回合制，每支队伍踢3场小组赛，积分前2名晋级淘汰赛。淘汰赛不再抽签，A组第一对阵B组第二，B组第一对阵A组第二，C组第一对阵D组第二，D组第一对阵C组第二，以此类推，同时，小组前二的两支队伍将分在上下两个半区，保证决赛前不再相遇。

本文提供了一个使用 iPad 进行数字阅读的低成本实用方案。
使用数字工具建立工作流基本上都遵循「收集-整理-阅读-输出」这样一个基本流程。在少数派上已经有很多文章关注了获取信息、收集整理、笔记输出等方面的方法论，但似乎比较少有人专门关注「阅读」这件事情。
阅读好像是一项不言自明、人人具备的技能，但是在数字时代，如何打造自己的数字阅读方案仍然是一个值得讨论的问题。虽然数字设备摆脱了纸质材料笨重的束缚，提供了更多的内容信息来源，但是也带来了新的难题。电脑、平板、手机……什么才是更好的阅读设备？书籍、报刊杂志、网页、社交媒体信息，如何更好的整合多源信息？
我认为，一个好的数字阅读方案应当满足以下要求：

简洁实用、舒适方便，专注于阅读本身；
提供一体化的阅读平台，既能广泛容纳各类来源、形式的内容，又能方便地记录标注笔记，对接后续内容输出；
成本较低，能够为更多人所用。

围绕这些目标，这篇文章介绍了我是如何从自己的需求出发，尝试用 iPad 打造适合自己的阅读工具的，希望能够给大家提供一些参考。
关于数字阅读：我需要什么样的工具
选择有效的工具必须先明确自己的需求。作为一个社科博士研究生以及数字工具的爱好者，我的日常阅读内容与来源大致包括这几个方面：

与个人研究议题相关的中英学术书籍、论文以及报告；
其他书籍，包括人文社科经典、人物传记、非虚构类作品、小说等；
专业媒体与官方资讯，个人关注的信源如财新、晚点、联合早报、澎湃、各类官媒等；
其他互联网信息，来自微信、微博等社交媒体以及其他网站。

在过去，我的阅读方式大致是这样的：…</span>
