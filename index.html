Sony’s longtime PlayStation hardware chief is retiring on October 1st. 60-year-old Masayasu Ito, who led the engineering for both the PS4 and PS5, is retiring according to Bloomberg and will be replaced by current director Lin Tao. Sony announced the changes in a brief press release today.
Ito originally joined Sony in 1986 before moving to the company’s PlayStation division in 2008 to lead PlayStation hardware engineering. Ito oversaw the engineering for the PlayStation 4, a hugely successful console that hit lifetime sales of 117.2 million as of March.

                              <span>A YugabyteDB users asked about running Nakama ((server for realtime social and web &amp; mobile game apps)) on YugabyteDB
As YugabyteDB is PostgreSQL-compatible, this is as easy as pointing the connection to the new database. The Nakama documentation shows an example of docker-compose.yaml for PostgreSQL and CockroachDB. 
The idea is:
put CREATE DATABASE in an itit script directory
start YugabyteDB with bin/yugabyted start --daemon&#x3D;false --listen&#x3D;0.0.0.0 --initial_scripts_dir&#x3D;/tmp/sql --base_dir&#x3D;/var/lib/yugabytedb

and before connecting, what to be sure that port 5433 is up:




       until echo &gt; /dev/tcp/yugabytedb/5433 ;
        do
         echo &quot;Waiting for YugabyteDB to be up...&quot; ; sleep 1 ;

Okay, so for today&#x27;s tutorial, I thought I&#x27;d do something in React. If you want to follow along, I recommend that you have some knowledge of React, otherwise some of the stuff might be very confusing to you. And as always there will be a YouTube version of this tutorial, you can find it here :)
This is what we&#x27;re building today:



Okay, so a fun thing I thought of doing, is everyone having the same website, but with different color themes.

                              <span>In this post, I will go through the minimum steps to configure Prometheus and Grafana in the existing EKS cluster, which is most likely used for monitoring and alerts.
Assuming that there are no pre-existing node groups, let&#x27;s create one.
First, let&#x27;s attach IAM role to Kubernetes service account using eksctl.
eksctl create iamserviceaccount \
  --name aws-node \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --cluster $EKS_CLUSTER_NAME \
  --role-name &quot;AmazonEKSVPCCNIRole&quot; \
  --attach-policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy \

Now let&#x27;s head over to AWS Management Console -&gt; EKS -&gt; Your cluster -&gt; Compute -&gt; Add node group.
We HAVE to use EC2 for Prometheus and Grafana, since they will both need volumes mounted to them.

Framer-motion is a motion library that allows you to create declarative animations, layout transitions and gestures while maintaining HTML and SVG element semantics.
⚛️ Beware, framer-motion is React-only library.
In case it might be an issue for you, check out the greensock (framework agnostic animation library) tutorial.
You might be familiar with our previous article on the subject (Framer Motion Tutorials: Make More Advanced Animations). It first came out quite a few versions of this library ago, so in this article we want to:

                              <span>Back when I was just starting with TypeScript, I used to neglect the value of declaring an explicit return type for my functions. Why bother specifying it when there is type inference and IntelliSense, right? Well, I was very wrong.
Turns out that its main benefit is actually not to whomever might call my function, but rather to whomever might edit my function in the future. Here&#x27;s why...
Imagine I have this function:
function getAge(person: Person) {
  return calculateAge(person.birthdate);
}

This is all good, as obviously it returns a number, and IntelliSense tells me that, too. But then later on, someone edits my function to add a guard condition as follows:
function getAge(person: Person) {
  if (person.birthdate &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; undefined) return null;

  return calculateAge(person.birthdate);
}

This won&#x27;t trigger a TS error, but now the inferred return type has become number | null, which is clearly different from the original intention. Now we have introduced, possibly unintentionally, a breaking change.
Now imagine if I have specified a return type in the first place, as follows:
function getAge(person: Person): number {
  // . . .
}

then my team mate would have known from the start what can and can&#x27;t be changed in the implementation without making a breaking change.</span>

                              <span>In this tutorial we’ll be building a React autocomplete search component that provides suggestions as a user types a search query. There are a number of libraries that provide autocomplete functionality in React but we’ll be creating a custom component from scratch.
Let’s get started by setting up a basic app using Create React App:
npx create-react-app react-autocomplete-search

Next create a new data.js file in the /src folder. This file contains an array that will be used to provide the autocomplete suggestions. In the real world you might want to replace this file with an API call to provide the data:
export const autoCompleteData &#x3D; [
    &quot;Asparagus&quot;,
    &quot;Beetroot&quot;,
    &quot;Broccoli&quot;,
    &quot;Cabbage&quot;,

                              <span>Node.js 创始人敦促甲骨文捐献 JavaScript 商标

Node.js 的创始人给甲骨文写了一封公开信，称 JavaScript 商标“是笼罩在世界最流行的编程语言上的一片乌云”。甲骨文公司在 2010 年收购昇阳公司时获得了 JavaScript、Java、MySQL 等商标。原则上，这意味着只有甲骨文公司可以允许一种语言被称为 JavaScript，以至于 JavaScript 的语言标准都只能称之为 ECMAScript。也有人曾经因为在 App 名称中使用了 JavaScript 而被下架。他称，甲骨文公司（几乎）“没有任何使用该商标的产品”，因而“JavaScript 商标侵权似乎很可能在法庭上无法执行”。他建议甲骨文公司捐献不用的 JavaScript 商标而获得商誉。

老王点评：我觉得这是与虎谋皮，与其指望甲骨文发善心捐献商标，倒不如所有 JavaScript 利益相关者考虑重新起个名字好，我觉得 JScript 就不错，就是不知道微软会怎么想。




苹果公司计划将其数字广告业务人员增加一倍

自从苹果去年推出了隐私规则，Facebook、Snap 和 Twitter 等已经损失了数十亿美元的广告收入，而市场估值的损失远超此数。与此同时，苹果广告平台团队拥有约 250 人，正在寻找另外 216 个这样的角色，几乎是它在 2020 年底招聘的 56 人的四倍。而苹果的广告业务已经从 2010 年代末的几亿美元收入上升到今年的约 50 亿美元，预计苹果将在四年内拥有 300 亿美元的广告业务。

微软再次提醒即将禁用基本认证方式

“基本认证”是一种古老的认证方法，通过向系统发送纯文本的密码来认证身份，由于其设计，对多因子认证的支持很不方便，因而被视为一种典型的安全缺陷。三年前，微软宣布它将开始使其软件产品摆脱基本认证，转而采用更现代、更安全的用户认证方法。在过去三年中，数百万用户已经远离了基本认证。现在，微软再次通知用户，10 月 1 日它将开始禁用 Exchange Online 各种协议中中尚未关闭的基本认证方式。

老王点评：这种历史遗留下来的明文协议，确实需要抛弃了，但是依旧有大量陈旧的系统、老旧的用户就是懒得改。</span>

                              <span>为了简化 Java 的繁琐，我制作了一个 Groovy 工具来分析我的音乐目录。


最近，我一直在研究 Groovy 是如何简化略微繁琐的 Java 的。在这篇文章中，我开始了一个简短的系列，通过创建一个分析我的音乐目录的工具来演示 Groovy 脚本。

在本文中，我将演示 groovy.File 类如何扩展和精简 java.File 并简化其使用。这为查看音乐文件夹的内容提供了一个框架，以确保预期的内容（例如，cover.jpg 文件）就位。我使用 JAudiotagger 库 来分析音乐文件的标签。

安装 Java 和 Groovy

Groovy 基于 Java，需要安装 Java。 Java 和 Groovy 的最新和稳定的版本可能都在你的 Linux 发行版的仓库中。 Groovy 也可以直接从 Apache Foundation 网站 安装。对于 Linux 用户来说，一个不错的选择是 SDKMan，它可用于获取 Java、Groovy 和许多其他相关工具的多个版本。对于本文，我使用以下 SDK 版本：


Java：版本 11.0.12-open 的 OpenJDK 11

Groovy：版本 3.0.8


音乐元数据

最近，我重整了我的音乐消费方式。我决定使用优秀的开源 Cantata 音乐播放器，它是开源 MPD 音乐播放器 的一个前端。我所有的电脑的音乐都存储在 /var/lib/mpd/music 目录下。在该音乐目录下有艺术家子目录，在每个艺术家子目录下有专辑子目录，包含音乐文件、cover.jpg，偶尔还有 PDF 格式的内页说明。

我绝大部分的音乐文件都是 FLAC 格式的，有一些是 MP3 格式，可能还有一小部分是 OGG 格式。我选择 JAudiotagger 库的一个原因是它可以透明地处理不同的标签格式。…</span>

                              <span>@youssef_darwish sat down to brainstorm how to go about this.

What we ended up with was a story-based game that takes you down different storylines depending on the choices you make.

We&#x27;re super stoked to present this game to all of you and we hope you&#x27;ll try it out and leave your thoughts below.

Pricing: $1+ (pay what you want)

I’ll be on here the entire day, so feel free to ask any questions you might have to.

The problem with energy costs is that most people don&#x27;t think about them. They just look at their overall bill without considering how the energy was used. By monitoring and measuring energy use through sensors in very specific locations, energy waste can be made transparent and reduced.
That&#x27;s the premise of the book Reinventing Fire: Bold Business Solutions for the New Energy Era, which offers methods to eliminate the use of fossil fuels by 2050 through energy waste reduction.

Having a dark theme for your website is a common feature these days. There are various ways to add a dark theme to your website, and in this article, I demonstrate a beginner-friendly way of programming a dark theme for the web. Feel free to explore, make mistakes, and, more importantly, learn by manipulating the code in your own way.

For the last few months, Parks &amp; Recreation has been my go-to background show. It’s what I watch while I’m doing the laundry, trying to catch up on email, or playing a video game I’d rather not listen to. The show’s seven seasons are all on Peacock, which is handy, because so is The Office — my other background show. All of this is to say, I watch a lot of Peacock. 
At one point today, while half-watching another Parks &amp; Rec episode, an ad came on that I suddenly realized I knew. And I didn’t just know it, I knew every single word of it. The jingle, especially, which ends in a sing-songy “CroppMetcalfe is the one with five stars!” That jingle has been stuck in my head for weeks, and it may never go away.
I don’t blame CroppMetcalfe,...

This Saturday was dubbed “National Cinema Day,” in which theaters around the US cut their ticket prices to $3 in an effort to keep bringing people back to the movie theater. And it worked! More than 8.1 million people went to the movies on Saturday, Variety found, compared to 1 million the day before and 1.7 million the day after. National Cinema Day brought the biggest crowds to theaters of any day in 2022, which leads to one inevitable conclusion: people will go to movies when movies only cost three bucks. Who knew!
One thing not needed to get the butts back in the seats? New movies. August has been a month-long movie doldrums, the result of so many pandemic shutdowns and general supply chain issues. Tom Cruise always has the answer,...

Ireland’s Data Protection Commission has fined Meta €405 million (about $402 million) after an investigation into how it handled teenagers’ data. The decision and fine were finalized last Friday, DPC spokesperson Caolmhe McGuire tells The Verge, and “full details of the decision will publish next week.”
The DPC’s deadline for making a final decision on this matter was the end of this week. The investigation leading started almost two years ago, and focused on two ways in which the company allegedly breached GDPR rules. The first was Instagram allowing young users, ages 13-17, to set up business accounts on the platform, which made those users’ contact information publicly available. (Users sometimes switch to business accounts because...

TikTok is denying reports that it was breached after a hacking group posted images of what they claim is a TikTok database that contains the platform’s source code and user information (via Bleeping Computer). In response to these allegations, TikTok said its team “found no evidence of a security breach.”
According to Bleeping Computer, hackers shared the images of the alleged database to a hacking forum, saying they obtained the data on a server used by TikTok. It claims the server stores over 2 billion records and 790GB worth of user data, platform statistics, code, and more.
“We have confirmed that the data samples in question are all publicly accessible and are not due to any compromise of TikTok systems, networks, or databases,”...

GoPro is reportedly getting ready to launch its next camera, but don’t hold your breath for a big redesign. Instead, according to images and specs first spotted by WinFuture, it appears the GoPro Hero11 Black will look virtually identical to the Hero10, and all the important tweaks will be on the inside.
The biggest upgrade sounds like a new sensor offering the “widest ever field of view on any GoPro,” which WinFuture says will be capable of 27-megapixel still images and 24.7-megapixel stills grabbed from videos. (The current Hero10 Black, for comparison, shoots 23-megapixel photos.) Video resolution doesn’t sound like it’s changing, though: the new model will reportedly still cap out at 5.3K at 60 frames per second, or 4K at 120 fps....

Thousands of Colorado residents found themselves locked out of their smart thermostats during sweltering temperatures last week in an effort to prevent power demand from overwhelming the grid. 
About 22,000 Xcel customers lost control of their smart thermostats for hours on August 30th, Denver7 News reports. That led to backlash on social media as some people said the temperatures inside their homes reached as high as 88 degrees Fahrenheit. Outdoor temperatures climbed into the 90s that day across parts of Colorado as much of the western US grappled with sweltering heat.
All of the customers affected had enrolled in an energy-saving program, called AC Rewards, that’s meant to ease the strain on the power grid during heatwaves. Xcel can...

Arcane, the popular Netflix animated series based on the League of Legends video game has won the award for Outstanding Animated Program at the Emmys’ Creative Arts ceremony, on top of the three other animation-related trophies it earned earlier this year.
This marks the first time that a streaming-exclusive show has won the award, despite growing competition in recent years. Arcane beat another streaming exclusive, Marvel’s What If…? (available to watch on Disney Plus), as well as non-streaming offerings from Bob’s Burgers, The Simpsons, and Rick and Morty to the punch. Previous years have seen entries from other Netflix animated shows, such as Big Mouth and BoJack Horseman, nominated for the award.

One year ago, we decided the written form of our articles was limiting. Our readers missed a key thing: practice. Even with many complete examples, nothing beats doing the thing yourself.

We spent the following months building our learning platform and the first training: &quot;Go in One Evening&quot;. What makes it unique from other online courses is that it&#x27;s 100% hands-on. There are no video lessons to go through. Instead, there are 80 exercises with just the essential theory included, and you solve them directly in your IDE.

The training is designed to get you started writing code quickly. It doesn&#x27;t go deep, but compresses what you need to know. Over 50% of trainees finish it within 6 hours.

The first few modules are free, so you can check if you like the format.

We count on your feedback! 🙂

                              <span>我们在使用 Fedora Linux 时有不同的偏好。例如，有些人选择 Fedora Linux，是因为 Fedora Workstation 默认使用 GNOME 作为其桌面环境。但也有一些人想使用 Fedora Linux 但想使用不同的桌面环境。或者也有一些人使用 Fedora Linux 有特定的需求，但不想被系统配置和应用安装所困扰。甚至有些人想根据自己的需要自由安装 Fedora Linux。因此 Fedora Linux 根据你的需要提供了多个版本。本文将介绍不同的 Fedora Linux 版本。

Fedora 官方版本

我们从 Fedora Linux 的 官方版本Edition 开始，即 Fedora Workstation、Fedora Server 和 Fedora IoT。 Fedora Workstation 是 Fedora Linux 的官方版本，可以安装在笔记本电脑和台式电脑上。此版本附带 GNOME 作为默认桌面环境和各种标准应用，因此 Fedora Linux 已为日常使用做好准备。而 Fedora Server 专门用于服务器用途，提供邮件服务器、DNS 等的安装。最后一个是 Fedora IoT，用于物联网和边缘设备生态系统。

在 Fedora 项目网站主页上，你可以找到另外两个版本：Fedora CoreOS 和 Fedora Silverblue。Fedora CoreOS 是一个自动更新的操作系统，旨在安全、大规模地运行容器化工作负载。而 Fedora Silverblue 是一个不可变的桌面操作系统，旨在支持以容器为中心的工作流。

微软承认 Windows 内置的防病毒软件 Defender 将谷歌的 Chrome 浏览器、微软基于 Chromium 的 Edge 浏览器、Docker 桌面版、Discord 等几款主流应用标记为恶意软件。他们表示将几小时内发布补丁。这是 Defender 今年第三次发生此类事件：今年早些时候，一些 Chrome 的更新被标记为潜在有害；3 月份，该公司将自己的 Office 更新标记为勒索软件威胁。

老王点评：消息很短，事情也不复杂，就是 Defender 挺离谱。连自家的 Edge 都不放过。




科学家使用机器学习打造动物的“谷歌翻译”

动物的交流远比人耳听起来要复杂得多，比如，不仅每只鼹鼠都有自己的发声特征，而且每个群体都有自己的方言，甚至鼠王更替后会出现新的“官方语言”。近年来，科学家们已经开始使用机器学习来解码动物的沟通，来识别吱吱作响的小鼠何时受到了压力，或者果蝠为何在叫喊。甚至更雄心勃勃的项目正在进行中 —— 创建一个全面的乌鸦叫声目录，绘制抹香鲸的语法，甚至建立允许人类回话的技术。

老王点评：小时候看的幻想故事里面人能和动物交流，但是那时候也没人告诉我们这是通过“人工智能”实现的啊。




GNU Grep 3.8 开始提醒不要使用 Egrep 和 Fgrep

自 2007 年以来，支持扩展正则表达式的 egrep 和匹配固定字符串的 fgrep 命令就已被废弃。从刚刚发布的 GNU Grep 3.8 开始，调用这些命令现在会向用户发出警告，告诉他们应该分别使用 grep -E 和 grep -F。在第七版的 Unix 中就有 egrep 和 fgrep 命令，尽管将 grep 分成三个程序在 1970 年代的小型计算机上也许是有用的，但是 egrep 和 fgrep 没有被 POSIX 标准化。

老王点评：确实该清理一些历史遗留的破烂了。GNU 中这种历史遗迹应该不少。</span>

                              <span>Notesnook 是一个以隐私为重点的新的记事本应用程序，它决定开源了。


当你想到一个开源的安全记事本应用程序时，你会想到什么？

可能是 标准笔记Standard Notes。

🔒 它是一个开源的、端到端加密的应用程序。而且也正是 Linux 用户最好的记事应用程序之一。

然而，提供类似于流行的印象笔记功能的注重隐私的标准笔记替代品较少。

幸运的是，我们有一个新的选择加入了名单，即 Notesnook。

📢 Notesnook 最近在 GPLv3 许可下进行了开源，以让社区帮助改进它，并确保该项目不至于走样。

目前，开发人员希望把重点放在改进 GitHub 仓库上，然后继续增加新的功能/其他开发活动。

Notesnook：它能提供什么？



Notesnook 是一个开源的零知识笔记存储平台，具有端到端加密功能。

与标准笔记类似，你可以免费使用它，也可以选择高级计划来解锁更多的好处。一些亮点包括：


手机端的应用锁。

私人笔记保险库。

密码保护的笔记共享。

跨平台。


界面看起来像是组合了各种有用的东西。我有兴趣单独写篇点评，或许写篇比较文章，听起来不错，对吗？

它可用于 Windows、mac 和 Linux。你可以下载用于 Linux 桌面的 AppImage 文件，或者 .deb/.rpm。

🏷️ 💲 为了庆祝开源，Notesnook 还为其 年度高级计划 提供高达 75% 的折扣，并提供 30 天退款保证。你可以试一试，看看你是否需要高级计划。

在印度付费的话，我看到有 80% 的折扣，使得一年的订阅费用只有 10 美元。其他地区的情况可能不同。

探索其 GitHub 页面 或 官方网站 以了解更多。此外，你可以阅读他们的 博客文章，了解他们为什么决定要开源。

💬 你认为 Notesnook 作为一个以隐私为中心的新的记事应用程序怎么样？

                              <span>Hi，朋友。这个周终于读完了《走出唯一真理观》，翻看笔记时看到了下面这句话，刚好对这个事情也有一些亲身体会，借此契机聊聊这个话题。

所谓的贯通不是用同一套道理概括一切，越是这样笼统地概括，越是无法接近本质，贯通是不同道理之间一种对话的契机。

从抽象到具体
        去年年底我需要招个实习生帮忙完成一些工作，看到HR推来的几份实习生简历还有点惊讶，现在实习生都这么卷吗？一页纸简历满满当当的实习经历，其中不乏优秀的大公司，实习做的事情看起来也很厉害，比如说“用户生命周期”、“销售转化率”、“曝光量”等等，我们开会经常用的词有一大半就出现了实习生的简历上，让人诚惶诚恐。
        面试深入交流就会发现同学对运营、用户的理解远不及简历上绚丽的词汇。回答问题时，套用模板方法论的痕迹很明显。比如，如果让你来策划一个活动，你会怎么策划？很多同学会告诉你网上的那些步骤，当你更深入一层追问其中细节时，“你的转化率是哪一个环节到哪一个环节的转化率？数据提升具体是做了什么动作？你为什么要做这个动作？透过这个动作你的思考是什么？”，同学的水平如何就体现出来了。当然，这样深入的细节追问不仅是实习生，哪怕正职员工的面试也会被细细询问。
        越是细节的追问，越容易发现不同的人对于一件事的理解、思考的深度差异。真正做过、不断思考的人会给你讲得特别清楚，逻辑也会很完善。
        如果说实习生对专业词汇和术语的大肆应用是这个行业的冰山一角，那么对“方法论”和“底层逻辑”的迷恋大概是互联网行业通病。聪明人太多，相较枯燥的执行更愿意去快速了解各种各样的方法论和底层逻辑，倡导快速达成目标和高效率。从这个角度来方法论也是一个ROI高、快速达成目标的方法。只要知道底层的方法论，就可以看透一切，所向披靡。

不知不觉又到 8 月底了，回顾电子手帐，一川今年截至8月看完了 24 本书，这其中只有两本小说，其中之一是萨莉 · 鲁尼的新作《美丽的世界，你在哪里》。今天就想和大家聊一聊这位 90 后爱尔兰当红作家的三部作品——《聊天记录》（2017 年）、《正常人》（2018 年）和《美丽的世界，你在哪里》（2021 年）。
一川今年的阅读记录
#顺遂的作家之路
迄今为止，鲁尼的作家之路可谓无比顺遂。处女作《聊天记录》斩获七家出版社的青睐、在 12 个国家出版，彼时她还在攻读美国文学硕士学位。第二本《正常人》全球销量超 300 万册、获奖无数，并于 2020 年被 BBC 和 Hulu 改编成热门剧集。第三本《美丽的世界，你在哪里》一经发售，便占据《纽约时报》小说排行榜第一名，还被 “美国版豆瓣”Goodreads 评为 2021 年年度最佳小说。《纽约时报》更是称鲁尼为 “千禧一代的第一位伟大作家”，虽然有些捧杀，但毫无疑问她是当今欧美文坛最闪耀的新星。
萨莉 · 鲁尼的三部作品
一川最初知道鲁尼就是因为她实在太红了，于是在北京前门逛 Page One 书店时便买了她的处女作《聊天记录》，但我阅读的第一本鲁尼作品是《正常人》。
《正常人》是鲁尼作品中主人公中初始年纪最为年轻的，两位爱尔兰西部的小镇青年——玛丽安和康奈尔是中学同学，虽然两人的家庭环境、社会阶层截然不同，但是原生家庭的伤痛让他们走到了一起，开启了一段友谊与爱欲交织的关系。两人在成长的不同时期，都曾经是世俗眼中的 “非正常人”、边缘人，虽然中途各自与他人交往，却又有某种不可抗拒的磁力让两人彼此拉近，双方在纠缠中既有伤害也有爱与救赎，最终慢慢学会了以对方为镜子，找到自己在生活中的位置。
老实说，我没有那么喜欢大火的《正常人》，大概由于青春期距离我太遥远了，书中某些残酷青春的情节于我而言缺乏共鸣，我可以理解两…</span>

There are (at least) two ways to look at the move to more green power generation: the supply side and the demand side. The supply side emphasizes a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy and carbon-free energy. The demand side, however, looks at how to reduce energy use, preferably without hurting the current standard of living.
This article will focus on making changes from the demand side.
The business opportunities in reducing energy demand
Imagine two salespeople who sell electricity for a utility company. They decide they don&#x27;t want to promote or sell electricity use anymore because of its negative environmental and climate change impact. …</span>

Updates to a system used to be relatively straightforward. When a developer needed to revise something that they&#x27;d already distributed to the public, an updater would be released for people to run. Users would run the updater, allowing old files to be replaced by new files and new files to be added. Even with these &quot;relatively straightforward&quot; updates, though, there was a catch. What happens when a user&#x27;s installation is in an unexpected state? What happens when an upgrade is interrupted? These questions are just as relevant now when all kinds of devices are online, and sometimes in need of important security updates. Many updates today are deli…</span>

还记得 YouTube 频道 Linus Tech Tips 中 Linus Sebastian 尝试在 Linux 上玩游戏 的场面吗? 尽管终端显示了明显的警告, 他最后还是把他的桌面环境删掉了。



考虑到 Sebastian 日常用 Windows 玩游戏, 换到 Linux 肯定需要一定的时间。

所以，这是 Linux 的问题吗? 还是 Sebastian 搞错了?

难道说，任何对操作系统不熟悉的用户在第一次尝试使用该系统的时候都会遇到问题?

接下来，你可以从不同的角度去了解 Linux 用户第一次使用 Windows 或者 macOS 的感受。

Linux 用户第一次用 Windows 或 macOS 会非常容易？还是会和 Sebastian 用 Linux 时一样感觉糟糕？

这肯定是非常有趣的话题……

一位 DevOps 高级工程师 Scott Williams 在一系列推文中假想了 Linux 用户第一次用 Windows 或 macOS 的场面。

在 Windows 11 上怎么启用 TPM 2.0？

如何安装 Windows 的最新版本 Windows 11？


Scott Williams：
今晚，看我在能不能在这台用了 4 年的笔记本电脑上启用 TPM2.0 并运行 Windows 11。这台电脑支持 Intel PTT，所以应该会很顺利吧？


怎样启用 TPM 2.0? 如何在 BIOS 菜单中找到它? 启用 TPM 2.0 安全吗? 我是否需要刷一个更新的 BIOS? 更新 BIOS 的过程中是否会弄坏我的主版？

                              <span>14 岁少年一小时破解澳大利亚情报机构的纪念币密码

澳大利亚信号局（ASD）为庆祝成立 75 周年，周四发布了仅有 5 万枚的纪念币，这个纪念币上有四层难度逐渐加大的密码信息。ASD 提供了一个表单，如果谁能破译这四层密码信息，他们很乐意为他提供一份工作。然而一位 14 岁的澳洲男孩，在短短一个多小时就成为第一个破译所有四层信息的人。不过，ASD 表示，该纪念币上还有隐藏的第五层密码信息，目前还没有人破解出来。

老王点评：后生可畏，亏得还悄悄隐藏了一个第五层（或许还有第六层？），ASD 才没有完全颜面扫地。




Ubuntu Unity 成为官方风味版

Canonical 在五年前就放弃了其开发的 Unity 桌面环境，转而使用 GNOME 作为默认桌面环境，并维护 KDE 等其它桌面环境作为官方风味版。2017 年 Ubuntu 17.04 的 Unity 7.5 成为最后的绝唱。不过，有喜爱 Unity 桌面的开发者维护了一个 Ubuntu Unity Remix 发行版，此前曾作为 Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 的非官方风味版而发布。并于今年发布了 Unity 7.6。该开发者本周宣布，从 Ubuntu 22.10 开始，Canonical 将正式接纳 Ubuntu Unity 并作为一种官方风味版本。


消息来源：9to5linux



老王点评：虽然开源具有开放性，即便项目原来的主人放弃，社区也有可能会接手而让项目重新复活。但是，这里面最难的不是“你可以”，而是“你做到”，这需要付出很多精力和承诺。比如国内的 CuteFish 夭折之后，虽然也有社区的一些人宣称接手，但是似乎没什么动静。




对 Linux 服务器的攻击比去年增加了 75%

趋势科技称，Linux 服务器正越来越多地受到勒索软件的攻击，在过去的一年里，由于网络犯罪分子希望将他们的攻击扩大到 Windows 操作系统之外，Linux 上检测到的勒索软件增加了 75%。LockBit 是近期最多产和最成功的勒索软件之一，现在它提供了一个基于 Linux 的变体，并已被用于在野外进行攻击。此外，基于 Linux 的加密货币挖掘恶意软件攻击也增加了 145%。


消息来源：ZDNet



老王点评：当人们认为 Linux 系统比 Windows 更安全时，安全团队可能会选择将重点放在防御 Windows 的网络犯罪上，而 Linux 往往承载着包括服务器在内的重要企业 IT 基础设施，一旦出现问题，可能造成的损失更大。</span>

                              <span>KDE Plasma 5.26 是一个令人兴奋的即将发布的更新版本，添加了大量有用的功能。




在过去的五个月里，流行的桌面环境 KDE Plasma 做了一些重大的更新和大量的修复。

上一个版本 Plasma 5.25 已经有了许多新的功能和改进，特别是对用户界面和体验的改进，而下一个版本听起来更令人兴奋。

KDE Plasma 5.26 有什么新功能？

让我们来抢先了解一下 KDE Plasma 5.26 的一些新功能。


KDE Plasma 5.26 计划于 2022 年 10 月 6 日发布。


1、用户界面的改进

如同上一个版本，Plasma 5.26 也对用户界面的互动方式做了许多改进。你会发现一些细微的变化，以及对在 KDE Plasma 5.26 上互动/搜索东西做了调整，给用户更多信息。

例如，格式Format 和 语言Language 的设置页面现在已经合并了，可以给你一个更干净的外观，并摆脱了一些与之相关的常见错误。

Han Young 为 这两个页面的合并 做了大量工作。

因此，你可以很容易地设置默认格式，以及对 你的地址、姓名风格、电话号码 等进行设置。



另一个例子包括，如果你在系统设置的 “自动启动Autostart” 窗口的 “登录脚本Login Scripts” 部分添加一个 Shell 脚本，而该脚本没有被标记为可执行，就会显示一个警告。此外，它还包括一个按钮，单击即可设置为可执行。

感谢 Nicolas Fella 的这个 贡献



以及，任务切换效果 “覆盖Cover” 和“翻转Flip&gt;” 使用了 Plasma 对话框作为背景。

在概览效果中使用的同样的 UI 组件现在也替代应用了，给人一种更一致的外观。这也包括统一的背景和模糊的效果。

                              <span>KDE 开发人员现在启用了流行的向后移植 PPA，并对 KDE Plasma 5.25 进行了必要的更新，你现在可以将其安装在 Kubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish 中。下面是方法。

KDE Plasma 5.25 于不久前的 2022 年 6 月 14 日发布，其中包含一些令人振奋的更新。在此版本中，你将获得动态强调色、改进的登录头像、浮动面板以及我们在 功能亮点文章 中介绍的许多功能。

但是，如果你正在运行早在 2022 年 4 月发布的 Kubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish，那么你使用的是带有 KDE Framework 5.92 的 KDE Plasma 5.24。

你可能正在稳定的 Kubuntu 22.04 版本中等待享受新功能，现在可以通过著名的向后移植 PPA 在 Kubuntu 22.04 中安装它。

如何在 Kubuntu 22.04 中安装 KDE Plasma 5.25

这是使用最新的 KDE Plasma 5.25 升级 Kubuntu 22.04 的方法。

GUI 方式

如果你惯于使用 KDE 的软件应用 “发现Discover”，请打开该应用。然后进入 “设置Settings” &gt; “软件源Sources” 并添加 PPA：ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports-extra。然后单击“更新Updates”。

终端方法（推荐）

我建议你打开一个终端并进行此升级以更快地执行和安装。

打开 Konsole 并运行以下命令以添加 向后移植 PPA。

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports-extra




现在，通过运行以下命令刷新包列表。然后验证 5.25 包是否可用。

sudo apt update


apt list --upgradable | grep 5.25




最后，运行最后一个命令来启动升级。

sudo apt full-upgrade


总共下载大约 200 MB 的软件包。根据你的互联网连接速度，整个过程大约需要 10 分钟。

上述命令完成后，重新启动系统。

重启后，你应该会在 Kubuntu 22.04 LTS 中看到新的 KDE Plasma 5.25。



其他向后移植 PPA

请注意，另外的向后移植 PPA ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports 目前提供的是 Plasma 5.24。因此，请勿使用与上面不同的 PPA。我不确定这个 PPA 是否会得到更新。

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports // 不要使用这个


如何卸载

在任何时候，如果你想回到 KDE Plasma 桌面的原始版本，那么你可以安装 ppa-purge 并删除该 PPA，然后刷新包。

打开终端，依次执行以下命令：

sudo apt install ppa-purge
sudo ppa-purge ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports-extra
sudo apt update


完成上述命令后，重启系统。

结束语

这就是全部了。一个漂亮而简单的步骤，将 Jammy Jellyfish 中的 KDE Plasma 升级到 Plasma 5.25。我希望你升级顺利。

如果您遇到任何错误，请在评论栏告诉我。

干杯。

如今因为网课、居家办公已经深入生活，打印机除了是企业办公的必备品，也成为了不少家庭书房的一部分。打印机耗材一般是指墨盒、墨粉、墨水、晒鼓等，但最核心的必备品则是复印纸，它是打印载体，对于我们一般家庭使用，都是A4尺寸的复印纸。
复印纸国家标准的技术指标

我们如今在使用的A4打印纸，执行的是GB/T 24988-2020 《复印纸》，是2021年正式施行的新国标，起草标准的牵头单位为A股上市公司太阳纸业，代表产品为金太阳。消费者比较熟悉的亚太森博品牌也是新国标的起草单位之一。
复印纸根据参数水平不同分为优等品和合格品，优等品有更为出色的参数表现。在尺寸方面，我们最为熟悉的A4纸的标准尺寸为210*297mm。

技术指标方面，国标规定了定量、厚度、挺度、平滑度、不透明度、D65亮度、可勃值、尘埃度、交货水分等指标的检测。
定量指标也称为克重，指的是单位面积的质量，我们常说的70g、80g纸，其实单位是g/㎡，对打印纸的质感起决定性作用，对于市面上的大部分产品而言，70g纸适合单面打印，80g纸适合双面打印，90g纸可用于照片打印。
高定量纸张一般伴随高厚度，但这也和印刷工艺有关，优等品的厚度要求更高。
挺度指纸张的抗弯曲呢你，高挺度的纸张在打印机中更稳定，更不容易卡纸。
平滑度则是对纸张表面凹凸特性的测试，变向影响着纸张的最终印刷效果。
不透明度则是单张反射因数和内反射因数的比值，是纸张不透光能力的体现，高不透明度的纸张在双面打印、书写时更不容易受到背面的影响。
D65亮度指的是纸张在D65（R457)光源下的内反射因数，体现的是纸张的白度，越接近100%，纸张的白度越高。
可勃值是反映纸张的吸水能力，吸水少的打印纸在遇到水泼溅时，受到的影响就越小。

                              <span>7 月 29 日，Beyoncé 发布了时隔六年的录音室专辑 Renaissance。Beyoncé 在这张专辑以电子舞曲为底色，探讨了关于性别、种族、接纳与和解的议题。自发布起，这张专辑也获得了乐评与听众的广泛好评，除了到现在还没有发正经 MV 这件事1。
除去对社会议题与个人议题的人文关怀，这张专辑一个极大的特点就是「听感流畅」，在保持专辑主题内涵一致的前提下，歌曲与歌曲之间衔接自然，节奏的变化与旋律的流动没有带来割裂。如果你在 Apple Music 或其他支持「无缝播放」的平台按顺序播放整张专辑，会发现在大部分时间，你甚至无法听出两首歌之间的区隔，上一首歌最末的点题同时成为下一首歌的引子。而这正是我们今天的主题：无缝播放、segue 与概念专辑。
 
在数字音乐之前的年代，无缝播放（gapless playback）根本算不上一个值得单独拿出来的概念。当一张黑胶唱片或磁带被灌录好，送到消费者手上时，往往也是像灌录的过程一样，从头开始一直播放到底的。专辑的封底或是歌词本可能会标注不同歌曲时长或所在的时间点，但整个播放的过程是连贯的。
这样的播放习惯与介质特性给了一些擅长以概念构建专辑的艺术家机会。其中最典型的就是 Pink Floyd 乐队的「摇滚歌剧」专辑《The Wall》，与围绕时间、死亡和精神疾病的《The Dark Side of the Moon》。这支乐队非常明显的特征，就是专辑中常常毫无断点或停顿。其中，后者甚至在灌录之前，先行在剧场不间断地演出完四十余分钟的全长，如同一出无法停止的舞台剧；唱片则为未能到达剧场的听众带去同样的连贯体验，随着音乐进行感受唱片中讲述的孤独、恐惧与对现实的嘲讽。这种处理方式就被称作「segue」，直译作「无间断地从一段（音乐或场景）自然转向另一段」，在模拟音乐时代，甚至绝大多数的 CD 中，这是一件非常自然的事，因为音乐就是…</span>

Recently I wrote a series on using Groovy scripts to clean up the tags in my music files. I developed a framework that recognized the structure of my music directory and used it to iterate over the content files. In the final article of that series, I separated this framework into a utility class that my scripts could use to process the content files.
This separate framework reminded me a lot of the way awk works. For those of you unfamiliar with awk, you might benefit from Opensource.com&#x27;s eBook, A practical guide to learning awk.
I have used awk extensively since 1984, when our little company bought its first &quot;real&quot; computer, which ran System V Unix. For me, awk was a…</span>

                              <span>有效的笔记并不只是简单地记录所听所见。
普通的笔记记录可以帮助巩固加深记忆和信息的过程，除了用自己的话尽可能准确地总结核心概念之外，还有更多思路方法可以进一步优化笔记。
大多数好学生的共同点是：他们使用特定的记笔记方法。在课前充分准备，在课堂中保持专注、积极参与，在课后高效复习关键概念。备考时也可以少走很多弯路。
本文中，我们整理了五种最适合大学生的记笔记方法，以及它们的适用场景和优缺点：

大纲法
康奈尔笔记法
笔记法
笔记法
笔记法

 
1. 大纲法 (The Outline Method)
大纲法可能是我们最熟悉的一种笔记法：结合项目符号（通常是小黑圆点）来表示不同的主题及其子主题，以大纲的形式构建笔记。开始在页面的最左侧编写主要主题，并使用缩进在下面的项目符号中添加相关的子主题。
大纲法可以在短时间内将大段信息的结构组织分明，也方便日后回顾时进一步审阅和编辑。
小红书博主 @百年摸鱼老字号
 
适用场景：课程/讲座/会议设置有比较清晰的结构和逻辑。
优点

以逻辑的方式突出讲座的重点
易于使用让学生集中注意力
减少审阅和编辑时间
为笔记提供适当和干净的结构

缺点

不适用于化学或数学等需要结合公式图表的科目
结构设定较为零散、不遵循特定逻辑的课程/讲座

 
2. 康奈尔笔记法 (The Cornell Method)

我们在之前的一篇文章中介绍过康奈尔笔记法。它与其他方法的区别主要在于页面布局：将页面分为三或四个部分，从顶部的一排标题和日期（可选）开始，底部一排，中间两列。 左列占页面30%的宽度，右列占70%。
 
右列记录所有实时课堂/会议笔记，左侧较窄的一列则用来补充记录关于笔记的评论、疑问或提示。在课堂/会议结束后，再花一点时间在底部栏补充总结主要思想，进一步加深记忆、消化知识点。

While skimming through SQL to prepare for interviews, I often come across this question: Find the employee with the highest or (second-highest) salary by joining a table containing employee information with another that contains department information. This raises a further question: What about finding the employee who earns the nth-highest salary department-wide?

                              <span>刚接触效率软件的朋友，经常会被两类软件弄混淆：
一类是清单/待办/Todo类软件，比如知名的滴答清单、极简待办、Reminder（苹果系统自带的提醒事项）、Microsoft to do、Things3、Sorted3、Todoist等等。
一类是日历类软件，比如苹果手机、华为手机系统自带的日历app，还有一些第三方的日历软件，比如Fantastical、Busycal、Google日历、Calendars等等。
这两类都能可以记录待办事项，进行时间上的规划，比如它们都能实现像「周三出差」、「5月3日购物」这样的日程提醒，但是二者又有很多不同之处，比如界面上的差异、使用方法上的差异等等。如果用更专业的术语来形容，这两类软件的目标也有显著的差别，前者主要进行任务（Tasks）管理，后者主要进行日程或时间（Time）管理，侧重点是不一样的。
这篇文章会从新手角度，聊一聊如何开启一段效率之旅。文章讲的内容比较浅显，一部分来自我这两年的探索，另一部分来自少数派友的分享。推荐大家读一读 @闲者时间_王掌柜君的文章（注意搜索之后选择「不限时间」，否则很容易错过早先的好文章），这篇文章也受到王掌柜 《术与道-聊聊我的时间管理》 这篇文章的启发，推荐大家阅读。
概念梳理
待办清单：侧重任务管理
第一类待办软件，顾名思义，就是以处理等待办理的事情，核心功能落在要做的「事件」上。
这类软件最简单的使用方法，就是在Inbox（收件箱）里输入一件待办事项。比如你想约几个老友抽空聚餐，只要在收件箱里记下这几个字，无需更多设置，等到你打开软件，看到这句话，就会起到提醒的作用。
如果你想要把这件事情规划得更详细，也可以为它设置各种属性，比如确定时间（约好在下周三晚8点），也可以预设提醒（前一天21:00提醒你，以提前安排出行），还可以设置标签（放到 #生活 这个标签下）、优先级（高，毕竟老朋友难得聚一次…</span>

@rubber9soul：给iPod找个家

购买渠道：咸鱼二手
购买价格：500元

最近迷恋从二手平台淘一些音频设备，这些「老家伙」使用起来不像现在的很多设备那样便利，但是声音上还是非常讲究的。
因为手里还留了几部 iPod，一直想买一个 Dock 音箱让它们继续发光发热，看了一圈之后锁定了 Bose SoundDock II。

在 iPod 鼎盛的时期，很多厂商会专门推出 Dock 音箱，其中 Bose 也非常积极，先后推出了很多代产品。Bose SoundDock II 最早发布于 2008 年，到现在已经十四年「高龄」了。它使用的是 30pin 接口，也是 Bose 最后一代兼容这个接口的 Dock 音箱（之后换为Lightning）。
SoundDock II 的声音也是 Bose 典型的调音风格，声音浑厚注重氛围感；因为两个全频喇叭有一定的横向间距，所以还能听出一些立体声效果。可能是最近听了太多智能音箱的缘故，听到SoundDock II 后突然有一种「这样才对嘛」的感觉哈哈。
我找了几款同价位的智能音箱对比下，大家可以听下声音风格的不同（可能有点不太公平，毕竟Bose当年也卖一千多，大家听个乐吧）：
 
和一代 SoundDock 相比，SoundDock II 还支持 3.5mm 音频输入，我之前买的一个 AirPort Express（A1264） 就派上用场了。

AirPort Express是苹果已经停产的路由器，它长得就像是一个MacBook电源，除了基础的网…</span>

我不希望你在没有判断的情况下全盘接受这篇文章的概念，所以请你在阅读的时候保持警觉。
文章里会涉及大量概念，由于和平时的使用方式有很大区别又想要便于理解，我用「」做了区分，如果你不习惯，请谅解。
另，最近住的地方开始降温了，我心情很好，希望你也有个好心情。

概念的第一个特征，非均质性
我想和你聊聊「概念」，准确地说，聊聊「概念」的两个特性。
第一个是非均质性。鉴于这个词我平时不常用，我觉得你应该也不太熟悉它。那你可以这么理解——你无法用「是」来说明一个概念。或者更直白一些，你无法对一个概念下一个准确的定义。
有些例子可以帮你理解这句话。你现在在脑子里随便选一个词，然后挑几本不同的字典查一下，或者网上找字典也可以。我作个假设，你大概会发现每本字典的解释都有一些差异，如果是纸质的字典，甚至同一字典不同的版本对同一个词的解释也有可能不一样。
所以你觉得发生了什么事？明明是同一个词，为什么不同的字典会有不同的解释？
或者我们可以举个更生活化的例子，包子。我不了解你的口味，但我猜你应该知道包子。于是，包子是什么？
就我个人而言，这大概是早餐偶尔会吃的，在早餐店一般都有的，从蒸笼里拿出来的，圆圆白白的，松松软软的，里面有馅的那个东西。
但是，你可能会有不同的意见。

包子必须在早餐店里才有吗？自己在家做过包子的人肯定也不少吧？
包子必须早餐吃吗？中午或者晚上甚至当零食解馋吃包子的人应该也有吧？
包子必须是圆的吗？做得稍微长一点，稍微三角形一点也有吧？
包子必须是白色的吗？黑麦包子应该也能找得到吧？

所以，到最后你可能会不认同我的想法。那么，包子是什么？我找到了度娘给的包子的定义。

包子，指用发面皮包馅蒸成的食品。

这当然比我给出的答案要准确了不少，但我觉得还有「一点点」不准确。

比如，你应该吃过一种生煎的包子吧？烤包子可能少一点，但也有，我还听说过油炸包子，虽然…</span>

                              <span>一直身处「音乐学院」这所「深宅大院」的我，常常面对一众亲朋：「你既为作曲专业，是否能如周杰伦那般给写曲一首，以引亢高歌？」的类似疑问感到十分无奈，也为当代古典音乐创作似乎已然成为妥妥的「少数派」，更几近沦为「音乐游乐园」中的「弃儿」而倍感受挫。
为了自己投身至今且热爱的「专业」，也为了分享更多隶属20世纪这一时期与所谓「Contemporary Classical」风格的音乐，遂尝试奋笔直书，一吐为快！
然，申请作者资格已半年有余，面对腹稿万千，竟不知该从何下手？直至今日读罢青年钢琴家张昊辰所写的 《演奏之外》 一书，对其中个别关键词若有所思，便「借题发挥」一二，间隙穿插作品若干，以供交流。
音乐与语言：音乐需要被听「懂」吗？
哲学语言自索绪尔始即讲求「能指」和「所指」的对应性，这是一种被彻底主体化的主客观映射。语言层面的二元性：能指和所指、深层和表层、语言和言说等关系在被转置到音乐中时相当难以定义且不易辨识。
语言可作为一种言谈交流工具，但也可以是文学，散文或诗歌。而音乐似乎一直都是「文学」的，它的演绎不会落入忠实于意思还是忠实于字词的困境。从规则出发，言说的语言和音乐的语言几乎完全同构，但就实际而言，二者又有相当的差距。当复调1产生时，人不需要对语义所指进行概念的解读，音乐，或称声音的「词汇」表达，一直就是其本身。而在言语中，语义的落实则确需占用人类大脑的大量带宽，一个词说出来或者不说出来，都同时包含且排除了许多其他的事物，我们或许不得不注重其中一条线索而放弃其他的线索，从这个角度看，语言似乎是单线的。
但语言的单线或许是一种无奈妥协？究其根本原因，也许是主体概念化的过程中，日常言语比音乐这般非概念化的输入对人脑运存的要求要高太多。而想要用类似语言之「所指」的层面去描述有意义的音乐是否也只能是一厢情愿的思考？

Amazing though it may seem, we each experience the world differently. That&#x27;s one reality with over 6 billion interpretations. Many of us use computers to broaden our experience of the world, but a computer is part of reality and so if you experience reality without, for instance, vision or sound, then you also experience a computer without vision or sound (or whatever your unique experience might be.) As humans, we don&#x27;t quite have the power to experience the world the way somebody does. We can mimic some of the surface-level things (I can close my eyes to mimic blindness, for example) but it&#x27;s only an imitation, without history, context, or urgency. As a …</span>

Tracee is a project by Aqua Security for tracing processes at runtime. By tracing processes using Linux eBPF (Berkeley packet filter) technology, Tracee can correlate collected information and identify malicious behavioral patterns.

BPF is a system to help in network traffic analysis. The later eBPF system extends classic BPF to improve the programmability of the Linux kernel in different areas, such as network filtering, function hooking, and so on. Thanks to its register-based virtual machine, which is embedded in the kernel, eBPF can execute programs written with a restricted C language without needing to recompile the kernel or load a modul…</span>

今年八月份，我在 App Store 上线了我的第一款 app，StaySleep。在发布之初的前三天，它一度登上了 App Store 健康健美分区的 Top 100，那几天我的社交平台也被如潮水一般的反馈、建议给淹没了，而在上周四，我惊喜地发现我的 app 出现在了 App Store 的每周编辑推荐位。趁着八月底暑假的最后几天，我想在少数派和各位朋友聊一聊 StaySleep 与我的故事。
当时看到这个排名的时候感觉太激动了
在想出这个「点子」之前，我都经历了什么？
「熬夜」，在熬与不熬中煎熬
或许是从上大学以后开始，我的入睡时间变得越来越晚，在有了手机这个连接世界的桥梁后，我似乎每时每刻都想着关注当前大家正在议论和关注的事情，哪怕是深夜。在高中那会我还没有那么多电子产品，所以最多的消遣活动就是睡前和室友们唠唠嗑，看看书架上翻过好几遍的鸡汤励志文学，很快也能感到困意然后安然睡去。而现在的晚上，即使我早早的就躺在床上希望自己可以尽快入睡，但翻来覆去以后还是忍不住再拿起手机，刷会短视频、刷会朋友圈，而时间一晃可能就是一个多小时。看着手机始终上时针的数字逐渐增大，我才明白，真的不能再看手机了，这时才恋恋不舍地放下手机，匆匆入梦。
熬夜的危害有很多，熬夜玩手机的危害更甚。手机的灯光会减少体内让我们感觉到困意的褪黑素的生成，手机里每时每刻变化的内容也不断刺激着我们产生更多的多巴胺，让我们更加兴奋。虽然偶尔我也会因为学业或者工作不得不熬夜，但是每次熬完夜第二天起床的感觉，就像是前…</span>

In this series, I&#x27;m developing several scripts to help in cleaning up my music collection. In the last article I wrote and tested a Groovy script to clean up the motley assembly of tag fields. In this article, I&#x27;ll separate the framework I&#x27;ve been using into a separate class and then write a test program to exercise it.
Install Java and Groovy
Groovy is based on Java and requires a Java installation. Both a recent and decent version of Java and Groovy might be in your Linux distribution&#x27;s repositories. Groovy can also be installed following the instructions on the Groovy homepage. A nice alternative for Linux users is SDKMan, which can be used to get multi…</span>

To be an effective leader in an open source community, you need a lot of information. How do I know who the most active members in my community are? Which companies are making the most contributions? Which contributors are drifting away and becoming inactive? Who in the community is knowledgeable about a specific topic?
These were just a few of the questions I had when I started leading the Mautic community at Acquia. But the problem was not a shortage of information.

                              <span>引言
许久没有静下来心来玩一款游戏了，前这几日宅在家里，体验了一下《光·遇》，而又联想到许多以前玩过的游戏，有感而发，遂就此文。由于专业的关系，本科学教育学时读过一些心理学，硕士念的也是中国哲学，因此本文会较为深入地去分析游戏的价值与影响，对游戏玩法、交互体验、设计美学的分析会稍少。本文将主要以美学的角度来赏析《光·遇》的美术风格，以心理学的角度去分析《光·遇》的核心玩法，以解释学的视角来诠释《光·遇》的禅意社交，最后以存在主义的核心价值作为文章收尾。虽以《光·遇》为始，但最后分析的也不仅仅是《光·遇》。综上，文章整体脉络变构成了“四位一体”的第九艺术分析。

美术风格：意象、自由、审美价值
意象
意象是审美中“美”本身，是美之本体。在美学的演化中，如果说有一个概念关注美学本身，那就是意象。《光·遇》中光怪陆离的风景意象如同卡尔维诺的《看不见的城市》那样，是现实与心中的那些虚构之城，交相辉映，轮回交替，更像是一场灵魂的旅行，带着思索穿梭于各个城市之间。
所谓意象，由“意”与“象”构成，“意”即诗意，而“象”并不只是指具象，也包括想象。我们先来看看其中之”象“。想象，是假定与自由的象征，假定了，感情才有自由。反过来说，若《光·遇》中场景如实反映生活，不存在那些会发光的蝴蝶、会漂浮在空中的水母、会上天如海的鲲鹏、漂浮在空中的城市，而仅是拘泥于现实生活中存在的物体，那么没有想象，感情就没有自由，也就没有诗意了。所以我们说，艺术的精致，就在于是一种情感、联想、语言的精致。作为第九艺术的游戏，《光·遇》将这种艺术的精致发挥的淋漓精致。

如果说想象是美学的灵魂，那么诗意是美学的境界。意象之中不但有极其精炼的“象”，而且有极其独特的“意”。所谓意境，不仅仅是意象群落之间的建构，而是意象与意象之间沿着意脉延伸发展而出的那般足以表达诗意的境界。
以《光·遇》之中的雨林来看，整体意象包括了绵…</span>

                              <span>关于PSB保罗巴顿音箱
如果说起音箱，那么一起会想到SONY、BOSE、JBL、雅马哈、哈曼卡顿这些品牌，毕竟他们已在国内深耕多年，有着相当大的品牌影响力和听众基础。

但如果有深入了解音频产品的话，必然或多或少会听到过PSB保罗巴顿这个品牌。毕竟PSB保罗巴顿也是一个拥有着50年历史的经典音响品牌，在国外的音频电子消费品市场中有着举足轻重的地位，其推出的Synchrony T600就是CES 2022唯一获奖的被动式音箱，也是当前PSB保罗巴顿的旗舰级音箱产品。

之所以PSB保罗巴顿在国内会小众，主要原因还是以前的购买途径只能海淘或代购，例如我看中的一套PSB Alpha系列低音炮，也只能求助于亚马逊，可想而知是有多麻烦。现今总算在国内上市，在某猫和某东都有了正规购买途径，售后和品质都有了保障。
也正因PSB保罗巴顿在某猫上的入驻，才让我有机会将PSB Alpha AM3这对「宝藏」书架音箱收入囊中，接下来咱们就品一下这对箱子的味道。

声音的变化
观影效果如何？

在观影方面建议将PSB Alpha AM3书架音箱切换到对话模式或者WideSound Plus模式，前者突出人声部分，后者是加强人声的同时也扩展声场，具体可以视影片的类型而定。
例如在回顾复联4时，就可以考虑优先启用WideSound Plus模式。在此模式下，场面感更宏大，双方互冲时更加激动人心，低音效果爆棚，各种爆炸声、轰鸣声在我面前炸裂，临场感相当赞。在场面混乱低音效果较足的情况下，人物间的对白依旧能保持清晰，具有很好的方位感。

而在一些以对白叙事为主的影片中，启用对话模式会更优。此时的人物对白会更突出，情绪感动细节被放大，可以更好地展现人物的内在情绪，让观者更容易被带入至影片的情绪中。

常规音乐播放体验

提到音乐播放，那么不得不拿出我CD随身听。这是17年前的产物，应该算是当年SONY发布的…</span>

                              <span>疑问
《卡片笔记写作法》(How to Take Smart Notes) 一书的热销，和一系列双链笔记的出现，使得这种更为「现代化」的笔记方式显得非常酷。最近看文章和刷视频，总能遇到有作者感慨对该方法「相见恨晚」，随后进行一番解读。
很多读者和观众看后，会羡慕不已，然后给这些内容点赞。但是，你有没有想过，卡片笔记写作法为什么管用？如何有效发挥作用？为什么很多人高呼「过瘾」，而另一些人嗤之以鼻呢？
我最近重读《福格行为模型》，对这个问题有了新的感悟。故写作本文为你分享。
动机
在我看来，卡片笔记和传统写作 (胸怀锦绣，下笔千言，甚至滔滔不绝) 最大的区别，在于对普通人写作「动机」这个事儿是不是有合理的预判。
很多人会购买健身房的年卡，然后很快就不再去了。这一笔进项，对于许多健身房来说，足够可观，且喜闻乐见。有趣的是，即便很多人听说过类似的故事，也不能抵御自己「付费购买健身年卡」的冲动。因为他们坚信，自己有充分的动机，会坚持健身。那些意志不坚定，导致花冤枉钱的事儿，一定不会出现在自己身上。
这事儿当然不止体现在健身房，你耳熟能详的例子应该还包括购买软件的年度会员功能订阅等。甚至，因为有时候促销，人们会一口气买它若干年的。
为什么呢？
因为不止一项研究的科学证据显示，人们会显著高估自己高水平动机的持续性。
而实际情况则不然。动机并不会一直悬空在那里，而是会受到很多因素的影响来波动。换句话说，你无法指望动机是个「永动机」 ，只做工不耗能。既然要耗能，原料之一便叫做「鸡血」。所以你会常听说一种叫做「打鸡血」或者「画大饼」的行为。你不要嘲笑这种行为很 low ，对于某些人来说，它非常有效且必要。

回到我们的主题（写作）。普通人会对自己的写作动机有过高的预期。例如说从今天开始，每天一千字，一个月搞定硕士毕业论文；或者每天 500 字，半年搞定一本小说……
实际上，几乎没有人能够保障这…</span>

                              <span>Hi 大家好，我是 3x3 的作者 KIDSTYO
在2022年初的时候，我制作发布了自己的第一款苹果平台应用 3x3
这是一款采用极简主义设计风格（参考Windows Phone）的时间管理应用
在此之前，我在少数派上看到很多朋友都在用自己的方式结合市面上的工具来搭建自己的时间管理体系
其中有一些关键词，比如间歇式日记、柳比歇夫时间记录法、双链等
其中一些理念，让我觉得和 3x3 的理念很类似，所以也是经过半年多的迭代完善后，想向各位介绍这款工具
我自己不太会写文章，所以这篇文章的内容可能会比较简单
我希望能分享一下我为什么要做这个软件以及分享我自己和一些用户的使用体验
3x3 的理念
首先我想分享一段话，这正是 3x3 核心理念：dots will somehow connect in your future

You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.

3x3 可以轻松的记录日常的时间线，可以关联每日、周、月、年、甚至人生的待办或者标签，并且待办之间可以进行双向链接
做3x3的想法就是，过了很多年之后，我还可以方便的找到当天做过有意义的事情
然后可以将所有事情串联起来，比如我学习一样事情，阅读一本书，可以清晰的知道每个阶段的过程，甚至你可以制作你自己的10000小时计划
3x3 的设计想法在 2018 年初，就有了，当时我还做了一个简单的网页，它…</span>

                              <span>在 WWDC22 上，Apple 发布 iOS 16 的时候，公布了一个功能叫实时活动，并向开发者开放 Live Activities API。

那么什么实时活动呢？
实时活动是一种新的交互式消息通知，用户可以在 iPhone 的锁屏界面看到事件的实时更新。比如球赛的比分、打车或订餐的订单状态、运动锻炼的实时数据等。这种消息通知形式允许开发者在实时活动期间更新单个交互式通知，而不是每次有状态更新时都发送新通知。通过减少发送的通知数量，同时使信息更易于访问。
Uber海外版团队设计的实时活动界面
Apple 在 iOS 16 开发者测试版 Beta 4 首次向开发者提供 ActivityKit 开发套件，首次在真机实装，随后在 Beta 6 和 Beta 7 并没有在真机实装实时活动功能。开发者目前只能在模拟器测试这项功能，或者降级回 Beta 4 或 Beta 5。Apple 在开发者网站也明确表示实时活动不会在首个 iOS16 正式版推出，而是在今年晚些时候的正式版突出。下图是模仿目前已有的原神安卓小组件、iOS 小组件做的实时活动版小组件。到了 8 月 16 日一大早用手机更新 Beta 6 之后，手机就不能运行和测试实时活动了，随后也看到其他开发者反馈实时活动在 Beta 6 版本没有实装。本文后面的截图只能在模拟器截取了，但模拟器不能更改壁纸，只有黑色背景。
Xcode真机调试报错ActivityKit没实装
实时活动界面部分是小组件扩展，开发者使用 WidgetKit 功能和 SwiftUI 编写界面布局，ActivityKit 是处理配置、启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动是一种消息通知，是一种可以自定义界面布局和更新状态的消息通知。下图是普通类型的消息通知，或许以后能看到换了界面布局的降雨提醒。
普通的消息通知类型
实时活动要求和限制
与小组件不同的是，小组件是通过时间线机制更新界面数据，实时活动是通过远程推送或 ActivityKit 从主应用程序来启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动无法访问网络或接收位置更新，下图网络请求图片失败。

ActivityKit 更新和远程推送通知更新的更新动态数据大小不能超过 4KB。
实时活动界面不能包含可交互元素，例如按钮和 WebView。当用户点击实时活动界面，将会打开主应用程序。
自定义实时活动的用户界面时，系统会忽略任何自定义动画，但可以使用系统自带的时间文本动画，当实时活动的动态内容发生变化时，系统会执行一些动画。文本视图通过模糊的内容过渡动画内容变化，系统为图像和 SF Symbols 符号动画内容过渡，根据内容或状态更改从用户界面添加或删除视图，视图会淡入淡出。
系统自带的时间文本动画系统为图像内容变化作出的动画效果
在开发者网站的描述中，如果实时活动的高度超过 160，系统可能会截断它。在实际测试中，实时活动界面最小高度为 64，最大高度可以达到 220。目前实时活动功能还不是正式的版本，有可能在之后的测试版本会有改变。

当用户在 App 首次启动时，点击允许应用程序发送通知时，就代表允许 App 发送实时活动通知，不允许则不会收到实时活动的通知。之后在系统设置 - 对应的 App -实时活动，可以关闭/开启实时活动权限。
实时活动权限位置
实时活动有 4 种活动状态，分别是：等待中、正在进行、成功、失败
实时活动在锁屏界面显示的时候，用户可以左划，点击清除按钮将其清除。用户没有清除的情况下，实时活动最多可以处于活动状态 8 小时，如果用户或应用程序尚未结束活动状态，系统会自动结束它。在此结束状态下，实时活动会在锁定屏幕上最多保留 4 个小时，最后系统会将其删除。

目前实时活动功能还在测试状态，开发者们还在为他们的 App 设计和测试这一项功能，下图是收集几款目前在测试中的实时活动的例子。
一些例子展示
关于实时活动这一功能的一些设想。在这个功能正式上线后，除了官方和大部分媒体提到的比赛比分、运动训练状态、行程状态、订单状态等这些功能以外，我们或许还可以看到这些功能：某餐饮 App 提醒你周四中午吃啥；原神体力、宝钱、参量质变仪到点提示上线领取；购物平台推送提醒商品抢购即将开启、正在抢购还剩余 69 件并且在不断减少等之类的功能。

以上就是关于实时活动这个功能的一些介绍和想法。之前的一篇锁屏天气的文章和视频会有评论说解锁在桌面小组件就能看到天气了啊，左划负一屏添加小组件就能看到天气了啊。不过对于我这种手机懒得解锁的用户来说，对于锁屏实时活动这个功能是非常期待的。大家对于实时活动这个系统特性及功能有什么想法和期待呢？</span>

代餐能代替三餐吗？
常见的两个代餐使用场景一是「不想 / 不能 / 不愿意做饭」，另一是「减脂和 / 或体重控制」。有关前者的讨论已有不少。感兴趣的读者可移步阅读下列一些文章。
  
以代餐完全取代三餐有一个前提，就是你选择的产品应该成分可靠、营养全面、配比合理。不过很遗憾，常规的商业代餐产品如 Soylent 或若饭都很难达到这个要求。Soylent 液体版（每瓶 414 毫升，提供 400 千卡热量）的碳水、蛋白质和脂肪供能比为 35%-19%-46%，若饭的供能比之类似。根据《中国居民膳食营养素参考摄入量（2017 年发布）》，18-60 岁成年人每日通过脂肪摄入的热量占比不应超过 30%，碳水化合物的供能比最低…</span>

                              <span>在我看来，Nreal Air 眼镜是一个非常「简单」、非常「聪明」的产品
包装大全套
拿到 Nreal Air 有几天时间了，老实讲等快递到那几天是很激动的，这不是我第一次使用 Nreal 眼镜了，在 2019 年的时候，我非常有幸去北京拜访过 Nreal，期间短暂的体验过 Nreal Air 的前身，当时的 demo 版本已经非常接近现在的样子，给我留下了非常深刻的印象。
如今，在我体验了一段时间，新鲜感消失之后，重新审视这个产品时，我觉得他们做了一些非常漂亮的取舍，得以让 Nreal Air 能够脱离小众，走向大众的视野。这在我的印象当中，可能是这个品类的第一次。并且在苹果发布他们的 AR 眼镜之前，分析一下 Nreal 的每一个选择背后的原因，想想苹果在面对取舍时会怎么选择，这是一个非常好的参照。

取舍
从用户端的需求来说，其实第一个选择非常简单：AR 眼镜到底能干什么？或者说我期望用户能用 AR 眼镜来做什么？
这个问题是简单的，但要回答清楚也是困难的。做产品定义时，产品经理大可以做一些「元宇宙」式的幻想：我希望 AR 眼镜是信息的入口，用户可以活在里面。这个回答可能没错，但是稍微认清一些现实的话，做到这一步是要有非常多的前提的，「元宇宙」里面的内容谁来填充？芯片是否具备这么高的算力能够渲染出丰富的画面？光机是不是能把这些画面精细的显示出来？这几个灵魂拷问可能就连产业巨头都只能兼顾 1-2 个，更别提 Nreal 只是一个 2017 年成立的创业公司了。
所以结合现实，他们的答案是，优先把画面显示好，内容生态寻求合作伙伴补充。
在这个答案的背后，就是他们两个最重要产品取舍：
1. 不在眼镜里集成计算模块和电池，将计算的部分放进用户固有设备中，如手机、平板。
2. 不做无线投屏，采用有线链接，保证稳定性和低延迟

这么选择一个重要的好处就是成本直接少一大块，反映到实…</span>

背景
读博士的这些年，我每天都在获取各式各样的知识。大到学术论文，小到快捷指令的配置教程，每份知识都可能在未来某个时刻派上用场。我根据自己的习惯和需求建立了一套工作流，用来记录以及内化各类知识。我的目标是形成自己的个人数据库，方便未来随时的调用。
知识有不同的特点，调用场景也各不相同。下面的表格展示了我对知识的理解以及相应的分类。在这篇文章里，我将针对每个类型，介绍了我记录（和内化）这些知识的经验，以及使用到的工具。


知识类型知识特点例子
学术研究格式固定，密度高，需要原文阅读学术论文，演讲
系统性知识内容多，密度低，自上而下结构大学课程，教科书，出版书籍
非系统性知识碎片化知识，自下而上结构CSDN，网络文章，教学/科普 视频
信息只需记录，不需整理做饭教学视频，服务器配置流程代码


1. 学术研究
首先要讨论的是学术研究类的知识，代表的例子就是学术论文。可能是因为阅读论文都需要花费巨大的精力而且经常会查阅，我通常会对阅读过论文有印象。即便不一定记得所有的细节，我还是很容易就能检索到，并重新阅读。
学术论文这一类知识有三个特点：

知识密度高：文章内容很浓缩，比较难再二次总结。未来通常需要再查阅论文的时候大概率还是得阅读原文。
格式固定：学术论文通常都会有 Abstract 来记录文章梗概。理工科的论文经常会有 Related Work, Methodology 和 Results 这些章节。第一次阅读难度较大，但理解以后再次阅读的难度不大，信息获取容易。
上下文重要：随意从论文中抽出来某一段文字或者配图，不一定很好理解。通常需要结合上下文才好理解。

由于查阅论文的大多需要阅读原文，所以我不会专门用笔记 app 给论文记笔记。我会把笔记直接记在论文 PDF 上。

相信许多普通用户都在用着M-ATX规格的主板，这也是颇具性价比的装机方案之一，毕竟追求极致性能也是需要口袋中有充足的氪金。但很有意思的是，虽然我们用着M-ATX规格主板，但机箱却多为ATX塔式。就如同我一样，给自己整了一个大机箱，装着一块M-ATX主板，美其名曰多出的空间散热更好。但说实话，机箱的散热效率还是要看风道设计，并不是箱子越大越好。

目前市面上M-ATX规格机箱并没有太多的新意，不是全侧透就是双侧透，有些外观甚至只差一个厂家LOGO，可选的机箱造型并不多，说是属于“缩小版”的ATX塔式机箱也不为过。对于我这种想减少光渲染又不想完全损失光影的玩家来说，确实很难抉择。

不过幸好最近华硕新推出了一款M-ATX规格机箱--华硕ASUS PRIME AP201冰立方机箱。初看商品介绍页面并没太大感觉，但翻了几篇买家秀后，发现设计感贼给力。接下来就聊聊我的换机体验，希望给各位小伙伴带来一些参考。

来自PRIME大师系列

当我将机箱换成华硕ASUS PRIME AP201冰立方机箱（以下简称华硕AP201冰立方机箱）并开机后，原先十分耀眼的光污染瞬间变得柔和起来。

关掉室内灯光后，整个华硕AP201冰立方机箱的光效就如同穿上了一套薄纱，内部的硬件会随着RGB灯效若隐若现，附加了一种神秘，确实有一种立方体的既视感。

从正上方看去，水冷风扇光影透过散热孔散出，被分割成具有像素风的格纹，经过切割的光影既复古又有奇幻的感觉。

而在光线充足的环境中，光影又并不会透出多少，朦胧中充满了低调，颇具内涵。

实际上华硕AP201冰立方机箱的内部自成天地，光影被拉得很足，离光污染全开之间也只差一个机盖开启动作。

外观小巧，却“大”有来头

华硕AP201冰立方机箱的外包装比较低调简洁，产品的特色描述并不算多，注明了支持360mm水冷，338mm显卡和ATX电源。
