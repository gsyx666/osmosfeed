MERN stack i.e. MongoDB, Express, React and Node is the most popular stack for developing web applications and Heroku is the cloud PaaS (Platform as a Service). Now what the hell is PaaS?
Well Platform as a Service means that Heroku gives a platform where we can deploy, manage and scale our application in the form of cloud service. We don’t need to take stress of production server and its operations. We can build our app and connects our code to the Heroku and the rest of the work will be done by Heroku only.
There are many platforms in the market where we can deploy our application but they charge money. Now I personally want free things and Heroku is free to use and we ca…</span>

I&#x27;m Choose css-tricks.com for example

To Doing this, first, on the top and left of view, click the hamburger menu and go to More tools &gt; Create Shortcut...

Brave, show you a prompt, then, enter your custom name for application and Check the open as window

application dekstop file exists on ~/Desktop/ directory by brave-{ANY_NAME}.desktop file name

Move the brave-{ANY_NAME}.desktop file into ~/.local/share/applications/ path by Terminal or GUI
$ mv brave-{ANY_NAME}.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/brave-css-tricks.desktop

Then, You can change replace any name to instead &#x27;css-tricks&#x27; because this make it readable
open nano in Terminal and update Exec&#x3D; and Icon&#x3D; property
$ nano ~/.local/share/application/brave-css-tricks.desktop


on the nano editor, change the Exec&#x3D; property to brave as launcher (alike below screenshot)

on the nano editor, change Icon&#x3D; to correct path (alike screenshot)
NOTE : you should change {USERNAME} to your exactly username /home/your-username

you can copy the {APP_ID} from the Exec&#x3D; property

This post was made on stack overflow blog by 
David Gray Widder is a PhD Student in Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon, and has studied challenges software engineers face related to trust and ethics in AI at NASA, Microsoft Research, and Intel Labs.

I found the article interesting enough to share it.
I received it via stack overflow newsletter.
https://stackoverflow.blog/newsletter/
The Ethical Source Movement seeks to use software licenses and other tools to give developers “the freedom and agency to ensure that our work is being used for social good and in service of human rights.” This view emphasizes the rights of developers to have a say in what the fruits of their labor are used for over the rights of any user to use the software for anything. There are a myriad of different licenses: some prohibit software from being used by companies that overwork developers in violation of labor laws, while others prohibit uses that violate human rights or help extract fossil fuels...
I cannot say more without copy pasting the article which would be wrong.
Free and open-source software licenses remove your ability to control what others do with your code. That’s kind of the point. It’s also why they’re so popular: anyone can use, remix, and sell your code into new technological possibilities with little restriction! What could go wrong?

Welcome to this week&#x27;s edition of myNewsWrap, news from the world of SAP, Microsoft and the world in between. As it is summer vacation time, it is a bit more quiet, but still some interesting stuff to dig into.
Let&#x27;s us start with the SAP side of the house i. e. news around the Business Technology Platform.
Let&#x27;s see what happened around Kyma:
SAP BTP Serverless Runtime to SAP BTP Kyma Runtime Migration Examples
SAP Application Router docker image publicly available
Well ... there was a blog post on importing OpenAPI-documented APIs remotely with CAP, but it was removed. I hope it will reappear.
Now let&#x27;s look at the Microsoft universe.
Here is what happened this week in the serverless space like Azure Functions and Static Web Apps:

At the beginning of my professional developer way (summer 2017), I was close to madness of the choice of frameworks. I was working on my first full-stack project with Meteor/Blaze, just because I found a cool tutorial about it on Youtube and moved through it.
Soon I understood that blaze is outdated or just not popular. And every day during a month I was reading comparisons like: &quot;Angular vs React vs Vue&quot;.
One of mine experienced dev friends said: &quot;React is an ugly garbage, Vue is elegant&quot;. Another one said: &quot;Vue is a toy for hipsters. It isn&#x27;t used widely. React is cool&quot;. Swi…</span>

                              <span>Introduction


While working on a new feature for my side project eduo instrukcije, I needed to translate HTML to other languages which was challenging to do for free. Google translate api has parameter &quot;format&quot; that when set to &quot;html&quot; ignores all tags and translates only real text, but it&#x27;s not free. There are couple of reversed engineered google translate apis that are totally free, but none of them had the format option available. Then I found out that you can use Google Translate api inside google sheets, and you can create real apis with google sheets, and I think that&#x27;s pretty cool.
First open google sheets and open a new app script

Then paste this doGet function
function doGet(e){
  var params &#x3D; e.parameter;
  var translation &#x3D; LanguageApp.translate(params.text, params.froml, params.to, {contentType: &#x27;html&#x27;});

  return ContentService.createTextOutput(translation).setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.TEXT);
}

Then go and deploy your api

Make sure that type is Web app and that everyone has access to it

Then copy your url 
Go to your url and add query parameters 

And that&#x27;s it!</span>

                              <span>C is a general-purpose programming language. C has been used to write everything from operating systems to complex programs like the python interpreter, git, oracle database, and more.
C is used in many PC games. It has been used to code some tasks for different small games and big games. So, learning C can be beneficial if you are interested in building a career in game development.
In this article, I’m gonna tell you why C programming is the best for beginners.
C used in embedded programming used to control micro-controllers. These micro-controllers are used in robotics, computers, and automation. Learning C can help you here too.

                              <span>In this article, we&#x27;ll be exploring how to add browser notifications to our browser extension.
As the starting point, I&#x27;ll use our popup extension.
GitHub repo.
The result of this article is the following interaction.

Browser notifications are native browsers that add notifications, much like you are used to on your mobile devices.
However, not many people opt-in for them at this stage. Let&#x27;s hope this changes in the future.
For this article, we&#x27;ll be using the popup extension to trigger a browser notification.
The first thing we&#x27;ll have to do is give the correct permissions to our application.
Open up your manifest.json file and add the following permissions.
{
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [
    &quot;notifications&quot;
  ]
}

This will allow us to access the native notification layer.
Then we can open up our src/App.jsx file.
export function App() {
  return (
    
 {
  chrome.notifications.create({
    type: &#x27;basic&#x27;,
    iconUrl: &#x27;icons/icon-48.png&#x27;,
    title: &#x27;Hi there 👋&#x27;,
    message: &#x27;Just a reminder that you rock!&#x27;,
    buttons: [{ title: &#x27;I know ☺️&#x27; }],
    priority: 0,
  });
};

This function calls the browser notification API and creates a new notification.
Note: You can find all options in the documentation
Now let&#x27;s build our app and see what happens.
guide here to build your app.
You should now see the notification occur!

GetX is a lightweight and powerful solution for Flutter. The solution combines high-speed state management with intelligent dependency injection, as well as route management.
If Flutter is already a framework then why should you  choose a micro-framework(GetX) for cross-app development in Flutter? So here are some benefits that GetX is providing.
Performance 
GetX provides high performance and minimum consumption of resources. GetX does not use Streams or ChangeNotifier.
Decoupling 
Business logic is separated from UI, and even dependencies can be separated using GetX Bindings.
Internationalization 
GetX provides i18n out of the box allowing you to write applications with v…</span>

What is Google Pay
Google Pay (known as G Pay) is a digital wallet platform and online payment system developed by Google to power in-app, online, and in-person contactless purchases on mobile devices. Users in the United States and India can also use an iOS device, albeit with limited functionality. In addition to this, the service also supports passes such as coupons, boarding passes, campus ID cards, car keys, event tickets, movie tickets, public transportation tickets, store cards, health records, and loyalty cards.

                              <span>在 2020 年 SolarWinds 网络间谍活动之后，一系列进一步的软件供应链漏洞凸显了确保软件监管链安全的必要性。在这场间谍活动中，俄罗斯黑客渗透到一个广泛使用的 IT 管理平台，并将受污染的升级程序悄悄带入其中。由于开源项目从根本上来说是分散的，而且经常是临时的活动，因此在这种背景下，这个问题尤其紧迫。GitHub 著名的 npm 注册中心广泛使用的 JavaScript 软件包遭到一系列令人不安的黑客攻击后，该公司前不久公布了一项战略，以提供更好的开源安全保护。

代码签名平台 Sigstore 将由微软旗下的 GitHub 支持，以用于 npm 软件包。代码签名类似于数字蜡封。为了让开源维护者更加容易地确认他们编写的代码是否与全球范围内人们实际下载的软件包中最终包含的代码相同，跨行业协作促成了该工具的创建。

GitHub 并不是开源生态系统的唯一组成部分，但 Sigstore 的联合开发者、Chainguard 的首席执行官 Dan Lorenc 指出，它是社区的一个重要枢纽，因为绝大多数项目都在这里存储和共享源代码。然而，当开发人员真正想下载开源软件或工具时，他们通常会通过软件包管理进行。

通过让包管理器可以使用 Sigstore，开发人员可以在 Sigstore 工具的帮助下，在软件通过供应链时处理加密检查和要求。这增加了产品流通过程中每个阶段的透明度。Lorenc 说，许多人在得知这些完整性检查尚未实施时感到震惊，开源生态系统中相当大的一部分长期以来一直依赖于盲目的信心。拜登政府于 2021 年 5 月发布了一项行政命令，主要涉及软件供应链安全问题。

Linux 基金会、谷歌、红帽、Purdue Universit 和 Chainguard 都对 Sigstore 的开发做出了贡献。现在有了使用 Sigstore 为 Python 包发行版签名的官方软件，而且开发软件的开源环境 Kubernetes 现在也支持它。

Sigstore 依靠免费和简单易用来鼓励采用，就像主要行业推动 HTTPS 网络加密一样，这在很大程度上是由非营利组织互联网安全研究组Internet Security Research Group的 Let&#x27;s Encrypt 等工具实现的。据 GitHub 称，该项目会首先提出 Sigstore 将如何在 npm 中实现的建议，并在开放评论期征求社区人员对该工具的精确部署策略的意见。然而，最终的目标是让这样的代码签名能够被尽可能多的开源项目使用，从而让对供应链的攻击更加困难。

GitHub 的 Hutchings 说：“我们希望看到这样一个世界，最终所有的软件工件都被签名并链接回源代码，这就是为什么构建像 Sigstore 这样的开放技术栈是如此重要，其他打包存储库也可以采用这种技术。”

                              <span>deepin 23 将是一个有趣的升级，有几个基本的变化。




deepin 仍然是目前最 漂亮的 Linux 发行版 之一。

虽然整个用户体验可能不是毫无痛点的，但它还是看起来不错的。deepin 的开发者尝试了一些引人关注的定制，以使它从人群中脱颖而出。

如果你是第一次了解它，你应该知道它是 基于 Debian Linux 的有趣发行版 之一。

随着 deepin 20 和它最近的小版本发布，他们推出了一系列不错的升级。现在，看起来deepin 23 将是下一个主要的升级。

deepin 23 预览版中的新内容



deepin 23 预览版已经可以进行测试。与之前的版本不同，deepin 23 包括一些基本的升级，在多个层面上影响用户体验。

主要的亮点包括：


一个新的软件包格式。

一个新的系统更新的构想。

一个新的资源库。

新的墙纸。

Linux 内核 5.18。


新的软件包格式：玲珑



玲珑 是 deepin 开发的新软件包格式。

它的目的是解决 Linux 下传统软件包格式的复杂依赖性所造成的各种兼容性问题。此外，通过支持沙盒以及增量更新和隐私保护来减少安全风险。

截至目前，你可以在其 玲珑商店 上找到这些软件包。

我们需要另一种软件包格式吗？我不这么认为。

有了 Flatpak 和 Snap 的存在，它听起来并不像以前没有的新东西。

对我来说，看起来 deepin 只是想拥有自己的软件包格式作为其产品的一部分。

原子式更新

系统更新将被视为原子操作，也就是说，当软件包被成功安装后，更新就完成了。如果安装失败，系统可以恢复到以前的版本，没有任何变化。

因此，你在升级后可以得到系统回滚的支持，并可以避免部分升级的困难。

独立的上游

虽然它是基于 Debian 的，但 deepin 的目标是为核心软件包和一些可选组件建立一个独立的仓库。

对于预览版，开发者提到，他们打算从上游如 Debian 和 Arch Linux 中学习，以改进他们的仓库。

新的墙纸



像其他主要版本一样，deepin 23 增加了一些令人耳目一新的壁纸和新的默认壁纸。

下载 deepin 23 预览

请注意，deepin 23稳定版还没有上市。因此，如果你想在你的测试系统上进行实验，并体验一下，请尝试预览版。

你可以在 官方公告 中找到 ISO 文件的下载链接。

As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words, and while that&#x27;s not always the case with terminal commands and code, it still holds true for the graphical desktop. Screenshots capture precisely what&#x27;s on your screen. I love taking them to have a record of who attends meetings, so I don&#x27;t have to write it down at the moment. Or to capture a bug when doing UI testing. We all take them for different reasons, though, and there are more ways to take a screenshot than you might at first think.
I started thinking about screenshots after Jim Hall wrote an article listing GNOME screenshots, GIMP, and Firefox as the ways he often takes screenshot…</span>

Cheers,
Istvan

P.S. Of course it&#x27;s the stage 1 of Stillgram&#x27;s development, so a lot has to be done. You makers understand this better than anyone 😅🧠 Especially dealing with different types of crowds in different settings all around the globe. The plan is to train a dedicated neural network basing on the actual photos you guys take with Stillgram. So please feel free to take as many as you want and share them with us 👉 https://www.instagram.com/stillg... 

Every stillgram counts, every one makes the A.I. better!

                              <span>https://progressier.com), I&#x27;ve made our app screenshot designer tool a standalone product available to anyone who needs it, free of charge. 

There are many alternatives for creating screenshots for the app stores. However, I thought it would be cool to make one that:
- anyone can use without signing up
- has mockups of recent phones
- works on mobile
- doesn&#x27;t lock features behind paywalls
- renders screenshots without watermarks
- is completely free

It&#x27;s optimized specifically for creating PWA screenshots (you can enter a URL and it&#x27;ll screenshot it for you). But you could also use it for generating screenshots for the App Store, Google Play, or even Product Hunt.

If you have any questions, please let me know!

💜💜💜💜💜

For now, I&#x27;m building ProjectionLab as a solo developer on nights and weekends. It&#x27;s already been quite a journey bringing PL to the point it is today; and I&#x27;m still energized and full of ideas for how to continue making it better, in part thanks to the feedback and support from communities of early adopters like you! 🙏 

Looking forward to hearing your feedback!

Earlier this week, Mark Zuckerberg posted a screenshot of his digital avatar standing in front of the Eiffel Tower and what I think is supposed to be la Sagrada Família as a way of announcing that Horizon Worlds was launching in France and Spain. Unfortunately for him, the internet more or less immediately started dragging and meme-ifying the screenshot of the virtual reality platform — likely because the graphics were, as one Twitter user described it, about on par with the Teletubbies game for the PlayStation One.
Zuckerberg’s apparently seen the memes and wants to let you know that Meta is working on the graphics. On Friday, he posted some new screenshots to Facebook and Instagram, showing off a significantly more life-like version of...

                              <span>The effort to electrify an iconic car has run into its first speed bump. Earlier this month, electric vehicle company Karma Automotive filed a lawsuit against DeLorean Motors Reimagined, the Texas-based company that holds the branding rights for the original DeLorean Motor Company (DMC), and four of its employees, alleging stolen intellectual property.
More broadly, Karma claims that DeLorean Motors Reimagined only exists because a joint venture between the two didn’t pan out. In a lawsuit filed on August 8th in US District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Karma alleges that four DeLorean employees — CEO Joost de Vries, COO Alan Yuan, vice president Neilo Harris, and chief marketing officer Troy Beetz — stole the company’s trade...

In potentially devastating news for kids and parents, about 200 episodes of Sesame Street have been removed from HBO Max, Variety reports. Many of the dropped episodes are from the show’s earliest seasons, and the number of Sesame Street episodes on the service has fallen from around 650 to 456, according to Variety. 
HBO and Sesame Street have been connected for years; WarnerMedia (now Warner Bros. Discovery) locked in a big five-year deal in 2019 to exclusively stream new episodes of the show, and Sesame Street first began airing on HBO in 2016.
“Sesame Street is and has always been an important part of television culture and a crown jewel of our preschool offering,” HBO Max spokesperson Chris Willard said in a statement to The Verge....

It’s been more than two years since Google plopped down $2.1 billion for Fitbit, but there hasn’t been much integration between the two companies’ products thus far. That looks like it’ll change this fall. Not only is the upcoming Pixel Watch set to get a shiny Fitbit integration, but it also appears that the rumored Fitbit Sense 2 and Versa 4 might have some kind of Google Wallet integration as well.
According to 9to5Google, the latest version of Android’s Play Services shows signs that Google Wallet — which includes Google Pay — is adding Fitbit smartwatch support. That includes a new menu with graphics resembling a “squircle” Fitbit smartwatch. The images are also labeled as a “Fitbit watch illustration.” (You can see the images here....

Wayfair saw a spike in sales at the beginning of the pandemic as customers stayed home and took an interest in renovating their space and shopping online but today announced it’s laying off 870 employees. In a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the online furniture and home decor retailer indicated that the “workforce reduction” affects 5 percent of its global workforce and 10 percent of its corporate team. 
In the company’s second-quarter results released on August 4th, Wayfair reported a decrease in active customers, orders per customer, order deliveries, and a slight decrease in orders delivered via Wayfair’s mobile app and in other areas. Overall, Wayfair saw a nearly 15 percent decrease in net revenue compared...

This weekend, if you want something to keep on in the background that’s not just infinite reruns of The Simpsons (you know who you are), why not check out these esports-y events: Pokémon World Championships 2022 and Games Done Quick’s Flame Fatales.
What is Pokémon World Championships 2022?
The Pokémon World Championships started Thursday, where the best players across various Pokémon games compete to be the very best, like no one ever was. (You see, I am Of A Certain Age, so I had to.) Though live Pokémon competitions have been slowly returning, with this year’s regional championships happening in-person throughout North America, Europe, and Latin America, Pokémon Worlds 2022 marks the return of the biggest championship tournament since...

Did you know you’re potentially being tracked when you load an in-app browser on iOS? A new tool reveals exactly how, showing how applications like TikTok and Instagram can potentially use JavaScript to view sensitive data, including your address, passwords and credit card information, without your consent.
The tool can be found at InAppBrowser.com. All you need to do is open the app you want to check and share the InAppBrowser.com URL somewhere within it — such as DMing the link to a friend or posting it in a comment. From there, you can tap the link and get a report from the website on what scripts are running in the background.

There’s a running joke all throughout She-Hulk: Attorney at Law’s premiere episode that’s hard to imagine Marvel Studios would have been comfortable making a few years ago before “America’s Ass” became a thing. But according to She-Hulk’s creator and head writer Jessica Gao, the joke — which punctuates the first of the series’ weekly post-credits stingers — reflects the exact sort of wild new energy Marvel head Kevin Feige challenged her to bring to the series.
This post contains spoilers for the first episode of She-Hulk: Attorney at Law.
Like many people, She-Hulk’s Jennifer Walters (Tatiana Maslany) is a fan of Steve Rogers who spends a considerable amount of time thinking about whether or not the centenarian ever had sex. Initially...

Pixel owners who haven’t upgraded to Android 13 yet, beware: it seems that several people aren’t able to use wireless charging after installing the latest OS, which released earlier this week (via 9to5Google). There have been several posts on Reddit about the issue from people using the Pixel 4, 4 XL, 6, and 6 Pro using a variety of wireless chargers, including Google’s first-party Pixel Stands. For Pixel 6 and 6 Pro owners, this could be an even bigger problem — they’re not allowed to roll back to Android 12 after updating to Android 13. 
According to some users’ reports, the phones do seem to recognize that they’re on a wireless charger, with one user even saying that their 4 XL shows the charging battery icon. However, the batteries...

                              <span>本教程介绍了如何实时监控 Linux 日志文件（桌面、服务器或应用）以进行诊断和故障排除。


当你在 Linux 桌面、服务器或任何应用中遇到问题时，你首先会查看单独的日志文件。日志文件通常是文本流和来自应用的带有时间戳的消息。它可以帮助你缩小特定问题的范围，并使你能够找到问题的原因。它还可以帮助从网络获得帮助。

一般来说，所有的日志文件都位于 /var/log。此目录包含特定应用和服务的扩展名为 .log 的日志文件，它还包含了其他含有日志的独立目录。



所以，如果你想监控一堆日志文件或特定的一个，这里有一些方法可以做到。

Linux 实时监控日志文件

使用 tail 命令

tail 命令是实时跟踪日志文件的最基本方式。特别是如果你在只有终端而没有 GUI 的服务器中。这很有帮助。

基本语法如下：

tail /path/to/log/file


用法：



可以使用开关 -f 跟踪实时更新的日志文件。例如，如果要关注 syslog，可以使用以下命令。

tail -f /var/log/syslog


你可以使用单个命令监控多个日志文件：

tail -f /var/log/syslog /var/log/dmesg


如果要监视 HTTP 或 sftp 或任何服务器，可以在此命令中使用它们各自的日志文件。

请记住，上述命令需要管理员权限。

使用 lnav（日志文件浏览器）



lnav 是一个出色的程序，你可以用它来用彩色编码的信息以更有条理的方式监控日志文件。在 Linux 系统中，这个工具不是默认安装的。你可以用下面的命令来安装它：

Ubuntu：

sudo apt install lnav


Fedora：

sudo dnf install lnav


lnav 的好处在于，如果你不想安装它，你可以下载其预编译的可执行文件并在任何地方运行它，甚至可以从 U 盘上运行。无需设置，并加载了功能。使用 lnav，你可以通过 SQL 查询日志文件，以及其他很酷的功能，你可以在其官方网站上学习。

安装后，你可以在具有管理员权限的终端上运行 lnav，它会默认显示 /var/log 中的所有日志并开始实时监控。

关于 systemd 的 journalctl 的一个说明

当今所有现代 Linux 发行版都主要使用 systemd。 systemd 提供了运行 Linux 操作系统的基本框架和组件。 systemd 通过 journalctl 提供日志服务，这有助于管理来自所有 systemd 服务的日志。你还可以使用以下命令实时监控各个 systemd 服务和日志。

journalctl -f


以下是一些特定的 journalctl 命令，可用于多种情况。你可以将这些与上面的 -f 选项结合使用以开始实时监控。

对于紧急系统消息，请使用：

journalctl -p 0


显示带有解释的错误：

journalctl -xb -p 3


使用时间控制过滤：

journalctl --since &quot;2022-12-04 06:00:00&quot;
journalctl --since &quot;2022-12-03&quot; --until &quot;2022-12-05 03:00:00&quot;
journalctl --since yesterday
journalctl --since 09:00 --until &quot;1 hour ago&quot;


如果你想了解更多关于 journalctl 的详细信息，我已经在这写了份 指南。

结束语

我希望这些命令和技巧可以帮助你找到桌面或服务器中问题/错误的根本原因。有关更多详细信息，你可以随时参考手册页并使用各种选项。如果你对本文有任何意见或想法，请使用下面的评论栏告诉我。

干杯。

微软的一位工程师分享了一个 Windows XP 时代的故事：某些型号的笔记本电脑在播放珍妮·杰克逊的上世纪八十年代的热门音乐视频《节奏国度》时会崩溃。更离奇的是相邻的一台未播放音乐的笔记本电脑也崩溃了。原因是《节奏国度》中的音频与某款笔记本硬盘发生共振，会干扰其运行。该 bug 被赋予了正式的 CVE 编号 CVE-2022-38392。还好这些电脑是 2005 年上市的，基本上已经淘汰。

骗子利用带有微软徽标的 U 盘来诈骗

一位安全顾问称，接到了一个印刷有微软品牌的欺诈 U 盘。该 U 盘被包装在一个 Office 2021 专业版的纸盒内。当用户将该 U 盘插入他们的电脑之后，就会弹出一条假的警告信息，告知用户他们的系统中存在病毒，并提示受害者拨打技术支持电话，这显然是骗子使用的号码。然后，骗子要求受害者安装一个远程访问程序来接管系统。

DDoS 攻击新纪录：每秒请求超过 4600 万次

今年 6 月，Cloudflare 报告遭遇了有史以来最大规模的 DDoS 网络攻击，峰值每秒请求高达 2600 万次。这刷新了 2021 年 8 月创下的 1720 万次和 2022 年 4 月创下的 1530 万次。不过谷歌最近披露的一个数据创造了新纪录：峰值达到了每秒 4600 万次。攻击于 6 月 1 日凌晨开始，速度为每秒 1 万次请求，但在 8 分钟后升至每秒 10 万次请求，此时 Cloud Armor 自适应保护启动。两分钟后，每秒请求数增加到 4600 万。攻击在 69 分钟内消失了，可能是因为被 Cloud Armor 挫败而没有达到预期的效果。

                              <span>1993 年，游戏开发公司 id Software 发行了一款第一人称射击游戏 《毁灭战士DOOM》，游戏一经发行迅速爆火。在今天看来，《毁灭战士》可谓有史以来最具影响力的游戏之一。

《毁灭战士》发行之后的第十年（2003 年），记者 大卫·库什纳David Kushner 出版了一本关于 id Software 的书，书名为《Doom 启示录Masters of Doom》，后被奉为记录毁灭战士创作史的典范读物。几年前我曾读过这本书，如今内容已记得不太真切了，但是书中有一个关于 id Software 首席程序员 约翰·卡马克John Carmack 的故事，我印象特别深刻。这里只对故事做粗略描述（具体情节请往下阅读）。实际上，早在《毁灭战士》开发前期，卡马克就发现自己为这款游戏编写的 3D 渲染器在渲染某些关卡时慢得像爬一样。对于《毁灭战士》这一对动感和速度有着相当高要求的射击游戏来说，这是一个非常严重的问题。意识到了这一问题的严重性，卡马克需要一个更加有效的渲染算法，于是他开始阅读相关论文。最后，他实现了一种叫做“二叉空间分割binary space partitioning（BSP）”的技术，极大地提升了《毁灭战士》游戏引擎的运行速度，而这项技术此前从未用于电子游戏当中。

一直以来，我对这个故事的印象十分深刻。卡马克将学术前沿研究运用于电子游戏之中，我觉得这正是他之所以成为传奇人物的原因。无论从哪个角度来看，卡马克都应该是电子游戏行业中人尽皆知的典型的天才程序员，只不过上面这个故事是我最先能够想到的理由。

显而易见，“二叉空间分割”这个术语听起来就是难度相当高的课题，能够自行阅读论文并将其付诸实施实属不易，所以这个故事给我留下了深刻的印象。我一直认为卡马克的做法十分具有创见性，不过由于我既不懂二叉空间分割到底是怎样的一项技术，也不晓得这项技术在当时究竟有…</span>

                              <span>What&#x27;s Tability?

I&#x27;m glad you ask! Our job is simple: to help teams stay focused on their goals. We built Tability because there were many great project management platform (like Clickup) but not a lot of options for goal-tracking. So we decided to tackle that issue to create a platform that is:
- Intuitive and pleasant to use
- Outcome-centric
- Built for focus

Now, we just had to find a way to link our goals back to your work. And this is what this integration is doing!

Your OKRs 🤝 your tasks

With our new Clickup integration you get the benefits of having the best of everything:
✓ an easy way to manage your OKRs in Tability.
✓ a great way to view progress on projects in Clickup.
✓ a simple way to link outcomes to outputs.

                              <span>由于上学和工作的关系，最近十多年我一直住在机场附近。机场内会有比其他地方更加专业的气象观测设备，而且能做到实时更新。借助这个优势我养成了看气象报文、雷达拼图和Prog Charts来判断天气的习惯。当然了，我做着一份靠天吃饭的工作，肯定是比别人更关心天气。那今天跟大家聊一聊我在平时是怎么看天气的~
一般情况
系统自带的天气app永远是最方便易用的，开机即用功能简单。在把天气信息截图分享，一目了然。我就偶尔问Siri或者Google Assistant明天天气怎么样，享受一下有助手的高级感。
看本场天气
我一般住在机场附近，所以看机场的气象报文基本等于在看自己家的天气。METAR1报看实时天气，TAF2报看未来24小时。可以看到刮什么样的风，下什么样的雨，能见度适不适合出门拍照，几点到几点不能上天台晒被子，有+TSRA了去远程哄一哄被打雷吓到的妹子，等等这些。

在 Android 平台上使用的是 Avia Weather ，简洁而且免费，只看天气很够用。付费之后可以解锁Groups功能，可以把一些机场分类。
 
在iOS上用的是AeroWeather Pro，最主要的是它有好用的Widget，还可以添加到Shortcuts。订阅后可以解锁所有飞行中能见到的气象图表。
 
报文里乱七八糟的字母和数字看不懂没关系，有兴趣的童鞋推荐给你们两份指南，一份是FAA的，一份是USAF的 。
看未来天气
    
MyRadar和Windy的功能类似，可以选择查看的信息极其丰富，好多航校甚至是航空公司也会用他们的数据。想要看懂这些图？不如来这里学习一下：aviationweather.gov/help 。下面是看图经验：

被高气压控制，通常都是好天气，反之亦然
有黄色或者西红柿炒鸡蛋颜色的地方一定有雷雨
预判雷雨的移动方向和速度
准静止锋类似暖锋，有持续不断的阴雨连绵
孤立的雷暴单体，下雨也就是一阵儿
冬天爬山，可以在零度等温线附近打卡留念
等压线密集的地方，有大风！
预测你的航班会不会因为天气原因延误
朋友坐飞机，告诉ta在起飞后的多久会遇到明显颠簸
看到哪里有火山喷发，搜一下那里附近的人上传的视频

除此之外，还能在Flightradar24上查看到气象信息，搭配飞机的飞行轨迹，看雷雨绕飞更加直观。不过实时的飞行轨迹和滞后的气象雷达图之间会有错位，有时候感觉莫名其妙。雷雨天气去机场接朋友，可以精准地选择出发时间，能在家多待会儿就多待会儿。
  
 
如果订阅了ForeFlight，再去坐飞机，会让飞行体验有质的飞跃~
 
我想大多数人都不会为了简单看个天气去搞这么复杂，不仅要记住奇奇怪怪的符号还要在app之间换来换去。只是因为我的工作离不开这些，顺便就带到了生活中，用起来还很顺手，就一直这样了。
我印象中分钟级降水预报是前几年彩云天气最早做出来的，我也有一个同样分钟级预报的故事：有一天我恰好在AOC大厅的气象雷达屏幕前，我想能不能人肉播报一次天气预报啊，于是就给我远在老家的老妈打了电话。问她家里是不是阴天啦，有没有下雨啊，她说阴天了没下雨。我说过一会儿就下啦。电话里聊了大概十分钟之后，诶，雨就来了。
哦对了，如果你女朋友说，晚上吃完饭我们去海边散散步吹吹海风吧。你一定要纠正她，晚上在海边儿吹的是陆风，不是海风，要不然叫海陆风也行。总之，天气这件事儿一定要弄清楚。</span>

 作为一个抖音受害者，我时常反思，有没有办法像刷抖音一样地学习？
 于是我拿出了 RSS 这个远古信息管理神器。 
上一篇文章，我们解决了「RSS 订阅源」的问题，本期内容我们就来解决 RSS 的第二大难题：RSS 阅读器。
一、RSS 阅读器
RSS 阅读器的选择，可以说五花八门。 
但总体上可以分为两种：一种是本地阅读器，一种是在线阅读器。
1、本地 RSS 阅读器
浏览器早期自带就有 RSS 阅读功能。 
但自从 2018 年 Firefox 也宣布取消 RSS 功能后，RSS 就彻底与浏览器分家。 
如今想要用 RSS，那么就要用浏览器扩展，又或者是客户端软件，现在常用的本地 RSS 阅读器有： 

本地 RSS 阅读器的特点，是操作感强，自定义功能多。 
但同时，本地 RSS 阅读器需要用自身网络来抓取更新，所以如果你不开启的话，那么就不会有新内容。
2、在线 RSS 阅读器
而在线 RSS 阅读器的特点，则是支持自动更新，还有跨平台同步。 
而且，一般还会有全文搜索、内容过滤、第三方服务集成等高级功能，现在常用的在线 RSS 阅读器有： 

但在线 RSS 阅读器的缺点也很明显。
 首先，免费帐户往往都会有订阅源数量、刷新时间的限制，并且还会有广告。 
所以综合而言，RSS 阅读器更好的选择是：使用本地 RSS 客户端来浏览在线 RSS 帐户。
3、Windows / 安卓方案
在 Windows 平台，我的选择是 Fluent Reader + Inoreader 内地版。 
Fluent Reader 是一款开源免费的 RSS 阅读器，界面简洁好看，而且是目前唯一全平台支持的 RSS 阅读器。 

Inoreader 的内地版（地址里比原来多一个 n），
是目前大陆地区，为数不多还能用的在线 RSS 阅读器。 …</span>

                              <span>写在前面
2020 年 7 月 29 日，我来到了北京，开始了自己的北漂生活。工作之后发现时间过得很快，转眼已经北漂两年了。在北京短短的两年里，留下了很多珍贵的回忆。北漂一年整的时候就有写篇回忆录的想法，但迟迟没有动笔，如今已经开启了北漂的第三年，感觉是时候开始提笔写这篇回忆录了。
前段时间在中国好邻居家里吃了顿饭，听阮哥说起「到底什么是北漂」。我觉得每个人对「北漂」的定义都是不一样的。我理解的「北漂」，暂时先卖个关子。
在北京
当初自己本科毕业的时候首选的是在北京、上海、深圳三座城市找工作。大学因为没在一线城市读，时常懊悔和一线城市比，资源还是匮乏，所以工作说什么也要去一线城市感受一下。后来因为上海离家太近首先就排除了上海，加上一直没去过北方，就直接考虑了去北京工作。
当初考虑北京的因素其实有两个，一是北京的互联网氛围我了解到的是比上海、深圳要好的，比如很多互联网公司当时都是在北京成立的，二是我很喜欢音乐，作为全国摇滚的发源地，氛围这方面北京是当之无愧的全国第一。
其实在北京最大的一个感受就是舒服。曾经听网上有人用一个字来形容北京，那就是「土」。在北京生活了两年，倒也确实慢慢理解了北京的「土」。比如胡同的起名，比如北京人的打扮没有那么精致，比如 CBD 旁边可能就是普通居民楼。
胡同
很喜欢北京的一点就是有逛不完的胡同。虽然随着城市规划，胡同已经少了很多，但我两年里仍然没有把每一条胡同都走一遍。而且北京的胡同绕到完全能让人迷路，从这条胡同穿到那条胡同的感觉太奇妙了。
前段时间参加了朋友拍的《胡同日记·春》纪录片线下放映活动，衔接去年冬天拍的《胡同日记·冬》。在她的镜头下，我感受到了北京胡同里发生的美好。如果有机会，还是挺想搬去胡同住一段时间的。
最喜欢的就是鼓楼那一片的胡同，咖啡店和小清吧很多。不管是白天在胡同里找家咖啡店坐下来喝一杯，还是晚上和朋友吃完饭，穿梭在胡同里，…</span>

众所周知，Square 出品的内存泄漏检测工具 LeakCanary 可以很方便的检测出 App 中存在的内存泄漏问题。当我们决定要不要在项目中引入 LeakCanary 的时候，经常也会听到声音：
“LeakCanary 接入简单，无需手动初始化。”
“LeakCanary 虽好，但就是太卡。”
“LeakCanary 虽好，但无法线上使用。”
一度我也是这么认为的，直到我认真研究了下才发现，事实可能并没有那么简单。本文就是尝试从 LeakCanary 的一些高级用法，来重新论证上述的观点。 文末会附上完整代码，可直接使用。
想要使用 LeakCanary 的一些高级用法，首先就是需要我们主动掌握 LeakCanary 的初始化时机，添加一些自定义的配置，下面就看一下如何手动初始化 LeakCanary ？
如何手动初始化 LeakCanary ？
正常情况下，我们只要添加下面一行代码，就可以在 App 中使用 LeakCanary 了。
dependencies {
  // debugImplementation because LeakCanary should only run in debug builds.
  debugImplementation &#x27;com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:2.9.1&#x27;
}

自动初始化
这是怎么做到的？是采用了 ContentProvider 的加载机制来做的。简单讲大致流程如下：

先执行 Application中的attachBaseContext 函数；
然后会执行 ContentProvider 中的 onCreate 函数；
最后才会走到 Application 中的 onCreate 函数中；
那下面就看一下 LeakCanary 是怎么自动初始化的，首先是在…</span>

                              <span>一、背景
现在的移动应用，视频是一个非常重要的组成部分，好像里面不搞一点视频就不是一个正常的移动App。在视频开发方面，可以分为视频录制和视频播放，视频录制的场景可能还比较少，这方面可以使用Google开源的 grafika。相比于视频录制，视频播放可以选择的方案就要多许多，比如Google的 ExoPlayer，B站的 ijkplayer，以及官方的MediaPlayer。
不过，我们今天要讲的是视频的缓存。最近，由于我们在开发视频方面没有考虑视频的缓存问题，造成了流量的浪费，然后遭到用户的投诉。在视频播放中，一般有两种两种策略：先下载再播放和边播放边缓存。
通常，为了提高用户的体验，我们会选择边播放边缓存的策略，不过市面上大多数的播放器都是只支持视频播放，在视频缓存这块基本上没啥好的方案，比如我们的App使用的是一个自己封装的库，类似于PlayerBase。PlayerBase是一种将解码器和播放视图组件化处理的解决方案框架，也即是一个对ExoPlayer、ijkplayer的包装库。
二、PlayerBase
PlayerBase是一种将解码器和播放视图组件化处理的解决方案框架。您需要什么解码器实现框架定义的抽象引入即可，对于视图，无论是播放器内的控制视图还是业务视图，均可以做到组件化处理。并且，它支持视频跨页面无缝衔接的效果，也是我们选择它的一个原因。
PlayerBase的使用也比较简单，使用的时候需要单独的添加解码器，具体使用哪种解码器，可以根据项目的需要自由的进行配置。
只使用MediaPlayer：
dependencies {
  //该依赖仅包含MediaPlayer解码
  implementation &#x27;com.kk.taurus.playerbase:playerbase:3.4.2&#x27;
}

使用ExoPlayer + MediaPlayer

前言
上一篇提到：Android—以面试角度剖析HashMap源码，分析了HashMap源码。为了加深印象，因此这篇将会实现手写HashMap！
话不多说，直接开始！（结合上一篇一起看效果更佳哟）
1、初始化
从上一篇我们知道：HashMap初始化分为：无参构造器；有两个参数的构造器。因此我们照虎画猫也来搞两个构造器！
1.1 无参初始化
从上一篇我们得知：
初始化无参构造器，对应map长度默认为：1 implements Map {
    //     扩冲
    float loadFactor &#x3D; 0.75f;
    //16  1 implements Map {
    //     扩冲

在这个教程中，你将学到如何对执行 HTTP 请求代码的进行单元测试。也就是说，你将看到用 Python 对 API 进行单元测试的艺术。

单元测试是指对单个行为的测试。在测试中，一个众所周知的经验法则就是隔离那些需要外部依赖的代码。

比如，当测试一段执行 HTTP 请求的代码时，建议在测试过程中，把真正的调用替换成一个假的的调用。这种情况下，每次运行测试的时候，就可以对它进行单元测试，而不需要执行一个真正的 HTTP 请求。

问题就是，怎样才能隔离这些代码？

这就是我希望在这篇博文中回答的问题！我不仅会向你展示如果去做，而且也会权衡不同方法之间的优点和缺点。

要求：


Python 3.8

pytest-mock

requests

flask

responses

VCR.py


使用一个天气状况 REST API 的演示程序

为了更好的解决这个问题，假设你正在创建一个天气状况的应用。这个应用使用第三方天气状况 REST API 来检索一个城市的天气信息。其中一个需求是生成一个简单的 HTML 页面，像下面这个图片：



伦敦的天气，OpenWeatherMap。图片是作者自己制作的。

为了获得天气的信息，必须得去某个地方找。幸运的是，通过 OpenWeatherMap 的 REST API 服务，可以获得一切需要的信息。

好的，很棒，但是我该怎么用呢？

通过发送一个 GET 请求到：https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q&#x3D;{city_name}&amp;appid&#x3D;{api_key}&amp;units&#x3D;metric，就可以获得你所需要的所有东西。在这个教程中，我会把城…</span>

                              <span>使用我最喜欢的工具在 Linux 上截屏，可以节省时间。




在写开源软件时，我更喜欢展示一些截图来帮助演示我在说什么。古语有云，一图胜千言。如果你能展示一件事，那通常比试图用言语描述它要好。

有几种方法可以在 Linux 中截图。以下是我在 Linux 上用于捕获截图的三种方法：

1、GNOME

GNOME 有一个很棒的内置截图工具。只需按下键盘上的 PrtScr 键，GNOME 就会显示一个截图对话框：



默认操作是抓取区域的截图。这是一种在你制作截图时裁剪截图的非常有用的方法。只需将高亮显示框移动到你需要的位置，然后使用“抓取”角来更改大小。或选择其他图标之一以截取整个屏幕或系统上的单个窗口。点击“圆圈”图标进行截图，类似于手机上的“拍照”按钮。 GNOME 截图工具将截图保存在图片文件夹内的截图文件夹中。

2、GIMP

如果你需要更多截图选项，你可以使用流行的图像编辑器 GIMP 截图。要进行截图，请选择“文件File”并选择“创建Create”子菜单，然后选择“截图Screenshot”。



该对话框允许你截取单个窗口、整个屏幕或仅一个区域的屏幕截图。我喜欢这个工具可以让你设置一个延迟：选择窗口后多长时间，按下截图后多长时间。当我想截取菜单操作的截图时，我经常使用此功能，因此我有足够的时间去窗口打开菜单。

GIMP 将截图作为新图像打开，你可以对其进行编辑并保存到你喜欢的位置。

3、Firefox

如果你需要截取网站的截图，请尝试使用 Firefox 的内置截图程序。右键单击网页正文中的任意位置，然后从菜单中选择“截图Take Screenshot”：



Firefox 切换到模态显示，并提示你单击或拖动页面以选择区域，或使用其中一个图标保存整个页面的副本，或仅在浏览器中可见的内容：



当你在屏幕上移动鼠标时，你可能会注意到 Firefox 会高亮显示某些区域。这些是页面上的块元素，例如 
 或其他块元素。单击该元素以对其进行截图。 Firefox 将截图保存到你的下载文件夹，或你设置为“下载”位置的任何位置。

如果你尝试记录流程，那么截图可以为你节省大量时间。

尝试使用其中一种方法在 Linux 上截图。

已经登陆火星达十年之久的好奇号火星车，依靠视觉测程法测量行驶距离，它通常每行驶约 1 米就要停下来检查周围环境的照片，以计算究竟走了多远。这种谨慎的做法使得好奇号的时速只有 45 米，而它本身的硬件能支持每小时 120 米的速度。更新后的软件可以让好奇号在静止时拍摄周围环境照片，而在行驶时检查位置并修正错误。测试显示，好奇号的时速能增加到 83.2 米，提速 50%。

Linus 破例为 NTFS3 内核驱动更新网开一面

Linux 6.0 的合并窗口已经关闭，正常情况下除了修复 bug，不会接受代码清理、功能添加等提交。而在两周的合并窗口期间，开源的 NTFS3 并未带来新功能代码和其它严重 bug 修复。不过，维护者在 rc1 发布后，提交了一批 NTFS3 代码重构和 bug 修复。Linus Torvalds 认为“似乎大多仅为重构和清理 —— 这些内容本该在上一个合并窗口期内出现。不过鉴于这些只涉及 NTFS3 本身，我们认为相关实验还是相当可靠的。”因而破例接纳了这些提交。

基础软件趋势：2001 年虚拟化，2006 年 IaaS，2009 年 aaS，2010 年开源 IaaS，2011 年开源 aaS，2013 年容器，2015 年云原生，2021 年启动基于 LOKI（Linux OpenStack Kubernetes Infrastructure）开源基础设施标准。

云计算行业趋势：2006 年公有云，2010 年私有云，2017 年混合云/多云，2019 年分布式云到 2020 年信创云，2022 年将开启数字原生基础设施（Digital Native Infrastructure）（DNI）之旅。

易捷行云 EasyStack 认为，基于 LOKI 数字原生基础设施将改变企业数字化转型和企业使用云计算的方式，加速传统企业成为数字原生企业。



同时，IDC 也指出，数字原生企业（Digital Native Enterprise）（DNE）应是企业数字化发展过程中转型变革的目标形态，它构建在未来数字基础架构上。由此可见，作为数字原生企业的底层基础 —— 基于 LOKI 数字原生基础设施，成为数字化转型的第一性原理。

在 IDC 刚刚发布的《新应用 新场景 新机会——新一代云平台白皮书》中，也对新一代数字基础架构应具备持续演进、统一架构、生态体系等特性进行了解析。

那么，什么样的基础设施才是新一代基础设施——数字原生基础设施？云原生和数字原生又有什么关联和区别？

At this year&#x27;s DrupalCon North America, EPAM Solution Architect John Picozzi presented a talk about the importance of non-code contribution. He talked about how everyone can get involved and why he believes this is an important topic. This article is a text adaptation of John&#x27;s talk; find a link below to a video recording of the complete presentation at DrupalCon.
What is non-code contribution? I asked Google this question and got the following answer: &quot;Any contribution that helps an open source project that does not involve writing code.&quot; Thanks, Google, but I already figured that out. If you asked me to dig deeper, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about providing your time, skills…</span>

Handling submission data gets really messy really fast. Add a large number of different forms and big, multi-disciplinary teams to the mix and you get... chaos 👼

Matti made this experience a few times building form and data management solutions for clients. He kept looking, and looking, and looking for a versatile, self-hostable solution built with a modern stack - until he decided to build one himself.

Because it&#x27;s no fun alone, he hit me up with the idea for an open-source Typeform (but actually it&#x27;s much more 🤓).

We put our heads together and started building. Today, we are more than happy to share with a bigger audience what we have built so far 🎉

写在前面
现在的我已经不再是一个学生，甚至也不再做研究。不过，写毕业论文的时候采用的工具和方法，确实一直沿用至今，已经为工作而进行了些许改良。在读硕士研究生的三年生活中（其实第三年已经在工作岗位上度过），我曾经尝试过不少与研究或者论文写作相关的数字工具；这些工具中有些帮助我在阅读文献的过程中准确把握文章意思，从而确定了个人选题；有些则在实验进展过程中帮助我看清数据之间的关系；还有些则是论文写作的时候帮了我大忙… 不过，这三年的研究生历程也让我越来越意识到，工具与效率之间并非强烈相关：或许有的时候工具的使用反而让人南辕北辙，采用更加精简的工具，以及加入更多个人的思考，才是完成研究工作的重点。
这篇文章仅仅是想要介绍自己在论文写作的过程中用到的一些工具与方法。我研究的科目是汉语作为第二语言习得。研究生期间除了研究本身，还需要承担一些教学工作，以及一些学生管理的工作，这篇文章也会有所涉猎。
Notion：是知识库，也是数据库，还是静态网页
Notion 的多面性与灵活性，我想少数派上的众多文章已经解释得清楚明白。但至于具体如何使用，这就看个人的情况了。在我个人的例子中，主要使用了 Notion 以下几个方面的特性：

数据库功能 - 用于学生信息管理、进度追踪、组会笔记
反向链接功能 - 用于阅读文献和笔记重点内容
静态网页分享功能 - 用于呈现课程大纲、更新课程材料

Notion 的数据库功能，由于数据库中每一条都可以单独作为一个页面，每一个页面上又可以创建新的数据库…… 如此嵌套之后，形成了十分灵活的数据库体系。无论是用于学生信息的管理、进度追踪还是系列笔记，都可以在短时间内搭建起较为整洁美观的数据表格。
Notion X 学生管理

                              <span>痛点
之前我跟你聊过很多次用卡片笔记法写文章的事儿。今天咱们换个话题，聊聊用卡片法做视频。
现在是移动互联网时代，学习和工作中需要用到视频制作的地方，还真不少。尤其是像我这样当老师的。

我这几年做了许多视频。但是实话实说，凡是复杂一些的视频，特别是技术类讲解展示，我在制作的时候总会感觉很焦虑。
焦虑的原因，是表达欲和成熟度不匹配。
我最想表达的时刻，往往是刚让电脑跑出来一个结果。这时候，我特别想把自己的成果和喜悦心情分享出去。
但是，一般这时候内容成熟度是不够的。例如前面的铺垫内容，还都没有准备好。讲解的思路，也都没有理顺。
怎么办呢？
常见做法，自然就是去查找和准备这些资料，直到胸有成竹。这样自己讲解内容时，才不会露怯。
可等到内容成熟度足够了，时间往往已经过去许久，我也没有那么想展示自己做出来的结果了，因为兴奋感衰退了。
很多有趣的内容，因此淹没在了我的笔记里。更可惜的，是那些没有记录下来的内容，就丢弃在风中了。可惜。
最近，我开始尝试用 Stable Diffusion 来人工智能绘图。这款工具真是非常强大。绘制出来的内容，比起 Disco Diffusion ，要精细得多。说明一下，我不是画家，上面描述的，是本人尝试对比后的主观感受。请不要跟我讨论某些风格上「Disco Diffusion 甩开 Stable Diffusion 几条街」之类的。不听不听。
举个例子，我最近开始读《九宫格写作法》这本书。里面有一段描述顾客尝试过一碗汤后的评论：

汤底是炖了 3 天的猪骨浓汤，配菜是汆烫得恰到好处的豆芽菜，吃起来脆嫩爽口。桌子上放有店家推荐的柚子胡椒，只需撒上一点点，柚子那清新的酸味便会让你眼前一亮。

我于是好奇心大起，就想尝试一下，这碗汤画出来是什么样子。于是我决定用 Stable Diffusion 来画。
首先还得把上面那段话翻译成英文，因为 Stable …</span>

在最近的 Def Con 安全会议上，安全研究人员演示了在约翰迪尔 4240 拖拉机的显示屏上运行 DOOM 游戏。研究人员花了数个月时间，来越狱该拖拉机所使用的 Linux 系统。在拖拉机上运行的 DOOM 游戏也经过了特别修改，场景被设置在玉米田里，玩家操纵拖拉机去消灭敌人。这一尝试不仅仅是好玩，其展示的获取 root 访问权限的方法，可能有助于农民绕过这类拖拉机的限制，自行维修拖拉机，这算是对“维护权”的一种努力。

老王点评：方法已经有了，现在就缺一台可以玩 DOOM 的拖拉机了，知道这拖拉机多少钱嘛。

When it comes to time synchronization for embedded systems in a distributed architecture, there are &quot;soft&quot; use cases (typical, everyday devices) and complex, or &quot;hard,&quot; use cases (car brake systems, aerospace). It&#x27;s easy to see that a hard use case has unique requirements and a low tolerance for latency. To put it another way, hard use cases have hard, real-time constraints.
Latency is the bitter enemy of real-time computation. Latency, in the context of a critical real-time application, is the time between data generation and data reception. The reality is that when there is an interconnected network of several systems, there&#x27;s latency.

While working on the open source ZenTao project, I get constant feedback that getting Agile up and running is a big task in many organizations. As with any new process, you will run into issues, and many of them will feel unique to your organization. While context is important, there&#x27;s a certain amount of abstraction possible after you&#x27;ve coached enough teams. This article covers the four most common issues I&#x27;ve encountered. While your Agile coach should analyze any actual problems in the context of your organization, knowing these general issues can help better prepare you and your teams for the transitional process.
Note that I only discuss is…</span>

                              <span>一、Android 13 正式版发布
今天，没做任何预告，谷歌为Pixel用户（Pixel 4、4a、5、5a和6系列等）送出惊喜，Android 13首个稳定版正式推送。
随后，谷歌承诺包括三星、小米、iQOO、摩托、一加、OPPO、Realme、vivo、传音、华硕、夏普、诺基亚、索尼等在内的第三方厂商，也会在今年晚些时候带来升级更新。对Android比较关注的同学可能知道，Android 13带来了安全改进、UI/主题完善、生产力提升、OpenJDK 11 LTS更新、ART优化、垃圾收集改进以及其他各种进化和变化。

需要注意的是，Google Pixel 6/Pixel6 Pro和Pixel 6a由于其搭载自研Tensor处理器，正式版Android 13会连同Bootloader一块更新，带来的结果就是，后续不能降级回Android 12。不过，正参与Android Beta项目也就是使用Android 13测试版的Pixel 6不影响，主要退出Beta，就能回归Android 12。

根据之前官方的介绍，最新的的Android 13主要升级点包括隐私安全和大幅优化大屏、折叠屏、小内存手机的流畅度。
二、新特性汇总
Android 13 面向开发者引入了一些出色的新功能和 API，参考官方Android 13 功能和变更列表，下表列出了所有可能会影响应用开发者的功能和行为变更的记录。

一、写作无处不在
Hello，我是小木箱，今天主要分享的内容是职场写作。接下来几天，我会给你们分享一些适用于不同场景的写作case，帮你搞定职场写作能力。
说到写作，很多朋友觉得是一件高大上、高门槛的事情。首先在工作中，写一封邮件 — 算写作。精准概括总结Boss的会议内容 — 算写作；其次在生活中，朋友圈发的推广文案— 算写作；最后每逢年底，你写的那份年终总结 — 也算是写作。
所以写作是工作中和生活中应用非常广泛、影响力非常大的一项技能。本文希望通过建立一套全新认知，让你从本质上意识到写作的重要性，下定决心学好写作。
不管你未来是否会从事写作相关的工作，不管你是否准备靠写作赚钱，强烈建议你学会写作。因为写作能够给你带来的帮助，远比你想象的要多。

二、学会写作的原因
2018年 6 月份，我开始尝试学习写作，没写作之前，我甚至无法完整构建一套属于自己的技术体系，后面思考了一下，为什么不通过写作来提升自己影响力同时建立知识框架呢?
我用了一年的时间，总共写了大约六十篇技术博客，文章渐渐得到掘金运营认可。之后，个人博客被某些大号转载。
我从长沙到深圳这两年，跳槽两次，工资涨了三倍。更有甚者，某些小公司面试全是走一下流程，然后就要我了。
所以我特别清楚，学好写作带来的优势。接下来我从四个方面来展开说说写作究竟能够带来哪些好处。
2.1 写作可以作为衡量你个人能力的指标
第一，写作可以作为衡量你价值的重要指标，对于技术人员而言写作能力不仅是你过往持续学习和未来文档能力的最直接体现，而且你的文章会毫无保留地体现你的发展潜力、创新意识、思维方式、知识深度和知识广度。所以写作能力强会极大地提高目标公司对你的印象分。
如果去观察一些互联网公司招聘的产品、运营和PMO等岗位，你就会发现很多公司已经开始把文档能力作为一个可以加分的…</span>

混入类引言
混入类是 Dart 中独有的概念，它是 继承 、实现 之外的另一种 is-a 关系的维护方式。它和接口非常像，一个类支持混入多个类，但在本质上和接口还是有很大区别的。在感觉上来说，从耦合性来看，混入类像是 抽象类 和 接口 的中间地带。下面就来认识一下混入类的 使用与特性 。
1. 混入类的定义与使用
混入类通过 mixin 关键字进行声明，如下的 MoveAble 类，其中可以持有 成员变量 ，也可以声明和实现成员方法。对混入类通过 with 关键字进行使用，如下的 Shape 混入了 MoveAble 类。在下面 main 方法测试中可以看出，混入一个类，就可以访问其中的成员属性与方法，这点和 继承 非常像。
void main(){
  Shape shape &#x3D; Shape();
  shape.speed &#x3D; 20; 
  shape.move();//&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;Shape move&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;
  print(shape is MoveAble);// true
}
​
mixin MoveAble{
  double speed &#x3D; 10;
  void move(){
    print(&quot;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;$runtimeType move&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&quot;);
  }
}
​
class Shape with MoveAble{
​
}

一个类可以混入若干个类，通过 , 号隔开。如下 Shape 混入了 MoveAble 和 PaintAble ，就表示 Shape 对象可以同时拥有这两个类的能力。这个功能和接口有点相似，不过混入类可以进行对方法进行实现，这点要比接口更灵活。有点 随插随用 的感觉，甚至 Shape 类中可以什么都不…</span>

早在今年 2 月，CalDigit 就正式在全球发布了新一代雷电 4 的扩展坞 TS4。作为 TS3 Plus 的升级版本，更多的接口和更高的规格，着实让我有了不少期待。和 CalDigit 的朋友联系之后，我也在 3 月中旬收到了这款真正让我「梦寐以求」的雷电 4 扩展坞。
但关于它和它背后的故事，还要从 2019 年说起。
缘起于 2019 年的一个期待
在 2019 年的年度征文中，我曾经描述过一个符合我需求的理想型扩展坞是怎样的。然而，由于 macOS 系统和雷电 3 的一些限制，我始终没有找到这样一款设备。在前前后后摸索的过程中，总计花掉了近一台 iPhone 11 的钱。
首先，由于 macOS 并不支持通过 DisplayPort 来实现 Display Chain，想要以扩展形式连接显示器就必须占用掉下行的雷电接口，否则就只能镜像显示。其次，雷电 3 在带宽的分配中，硬性规定了必须保留 18Gbps 的带宽用于显示信号（DisplayPort）的传输，实际留给数据传输的空间只有 22Gbps。而且，显示带宽在不足时，还可以占用这为数不多的 22Gbps 数据带宽，反之，就算没有外接显示器，数据带宽也不能使用为显示预留的 18Gpbs。
当时妥协但最好的选择：CalDigit TS3 Plus
直到雷电 4 的到来，这个情况才得以获得改变。
首先，Intel 在雷电 4 协议上取消了为 DisplayPort 预留 18 Gpbs 带宽，提供了满速的 32Gbps 数据传输（相当于 PCIe 3.0×4），尽管还…</span>

                              <span>作为少数派的老用户和资深潜水员，在各种文章中探索到了新的工具和学到了很多使用小技巧。在过去从学生到金融狗的过程中，笔记管理也逐步完成了从Evernote-&gt;印象笔记(别用!)-&gt;Notion的切换。在少数派上有很多科研大神、学生/老师、Blogger以及其他行业的用户来分享他们在Notion上的用法和经验，但鲜少见到金融行业的分享案例——可能大家都忙着写点评和忙着送外卖了(误)。我就来抛砖引玉分享一点作为一个苦逼消费研究员用Notion来管理行业研究的经验。
背景提醒：用的是自己电脑(Macbook Pro，Mac版本的万得是永远的痛)，没有太多分享的需求，以及作为买方纪要查的不严，有合规风险的请自行判断哈。以下中英文混杂请见谅。
整体架构和思路
起因：其实很久以前在Notion刚出的时候有尝试过以块结构为基础的笔记软件，但当时觉得只是有些新意以及排版会好看一点，但对于自身的Evernote用户来说并没有太大的吸引力。直到回国后，发现Notion已经有了非常能用的Database功能，加上被国内印象笔记折磨了千百次，才动了尝试迁移到Notion的想法。
需求：在入职成为一个消费研究员之后逐步理清了自己在文档管理方面的需求，发现和Notion能提供的其实非常贴合。作为一个金融行业的研究员，每天会主动被动的接受无数的信息和纪要，而传统的文件夹管理、金融行业常用的有道云对于我来说只能起到一个简单的收集作用而无法后期自动化的为我提供收集归纳的帮助。其实，日常消费研究员的工作就是跟踪行业，跟踪不同的标的(股票)，以及相对应的提供点评。作为一个笔记软件，我希望能够做到自动化、结构化的收纳，便携的搜索，方便快捷添加后期点评。
所以从总体的架构上，我做了如下四个维度的Database： Sectors， Sub-Sectors，Equities和Memos。Sector即大行业，比如食品饮…</span>

前言
我们日常开发中，永远离不开debug调试，断点技术一直是我们排查bug的有力手段之一！随着网络安全意识的逐步提高，对app安全的要求就越来越高，反调试 （有朋友不太了解这个概念，这里我解释一下，就是通过调试技术，比如我们可以反编译某个apk，即使apk是release包，同样也可以进行反编译后调试，比如最新版本的jadx）的技术也渐渐深入我们开发者的眼帘，那么我们来具体看看，android中，同时也是linux内核中，是怎么处理调试程序的！
执行跟踪
无论是断点还是其他debug手段，其实都可以总结为一个技术手段，就是执行跟踪，含义就是一个程序监视另一个程序的技术，被跟踪的程序通过一步步执行，知道收到一个信号或者系统调用停止！
在linux内核中，就是通过ptrace系统调用进行的执行跟踪
#include  
long ptrace(enum __ptrace_request request, pid_t pid, void *addr, void *data);

随着我们对linux的了解，那么就离不开对权限的讨论！一个程序跟踪另一个程序这种东西，按照linux风格，肯定是具有某种权限才可以执行！这个权限就是设置了CAP_SYS_PTRACE 权限的进程，就可以跟踪系统中除了init进程（linux第一个进程）外的任何进程！当然！就算一个进程没有CAP_SYS_PTRACE权限，也可以跟踪一个与被监视进程有相同属组的进程，比如父进程可以通过ptrace跟踪子进程！执行跟踪还有一个非常重要的特点，就是两个进程不能同时跟踪一个进程！
我们再回到ptrace函数调用，可以看到第一个参数是一个枚举值，其实就是发出ptrace的当前行为，它有以下可选命…</span>

一、基调
Hello~我是小木箱，今天分享的主要内容是: 手把手教你快速搞定4个职场写作场景。在讲具体内容前先介绍一个词基调，什么是基调呢？百度百科的解释是作品中主要的音调。在写作里面，基调就是写作时的基本思想。艺术作品需要它独特的基调，写作也需要它独特的基调。

如果我们在写作之前，提前掌握了内容的基调，那么便把握了文章的命脉。开始写作后的大方向是一定不会错的。
二、四类常见的职场写作
职场写作在类型上分为四大类: 总结类、调查报告类、申请类和计划类。

我们的工作总结其实就是典型的总结类，包括有: 年度总结、月度总结、周报和日报。常见的调查报告类有竞品分析报告和市场调研报告。申请类可以分为申请转正、申请加薪、申请费用等。计划类可以分为工作计划、项目计划、活动计划三个方向。这四个类别，几乎把我们在工作中能够接触到的写作场景，全都 cover 住了。

分好类后，我们来逐个定基调，看看这几个写作场景要怎么写?

2.1 总结类

第一，总结类，总结类的文章基调是: 有深度、有内容、有规划，以年终笔。有些职场人在年终总结的时候潜移默化地写成了流水账。直接把月报汇总，然后阐述分别都做了哪些事，这是一份典型的负面教材。
你的年终总结不但要给你的上级看，而且还要给公司看，平时都做的哪些事。你的领导心里基本都清楚，把这些内容逐个再写一遍既无意义，也无法突出你的能力。
你的领导要看什么呢？第一，看你的成果，第二，看你的分析，第三，看你从过去一年的工作中沉淀的经验，这时候文档重要性不言而喻了，第四，看你对明年的展望，是否干劲十足。
所以在总结的时候，要以结果导向，不要过度关注过程，着重汇报成果。成果最好可以量化，要用数字表达，因为相比于文字，数字展示的更直观。
比如你是android开发的，你在写的年度总结时候，就可以这样写: …</span>

前言
App 内的下载功能也是我们常用的场景，比如下载最新的 Apk 安装包，还有些会下载图片，或者资源，插件等场景。
下载不是很简单的功能吗？OkHttp就能下载，基于OkHttp实现的一些框架那更多，比较出名的有FileDownloader okdownload RxDownload 等等。
同时我们 Android 系统服务 DownloadManager 同样可以使用下载服务，他们之间有什么区别？
一、DownloadManager的默认使用
DownloadManager 是android2.3以后，系统下载的方法。可以让 Android 设备请求的 URI 被下载到一个特定的目标文件。客户端将会在后台与http交互进行下载，或者在下载失败，或者连接改变，重新启动系统后重新下载。还可以进入系统的下载管理界面查看进度。
内部主要包含 DownloadManager.Query 和 DownloadManager.Request 两个重要类。一个是封装一些下载请求的参数，一个是用于查询下载的信息。Request 是必须的，Query是非必须的。
通常使用 DownloadManager 推荐我们使用通知栏展示真正进行下载，并且我们可以跳转到下载器页面查看。
    private fun startDownLoad() {

        //下载链接 这里下载手机B站为示例

𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗮 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁:
I often create different projects in the form of websites and often those sites will be static or client-side rendered. 

Having a contact form on static sites through third-party services involves a bit of extra work and sometimes could be cumbersome. I often ignore adding contact or feedback forms on most of my sites to avoid the hassle of setting forms.

So I thought if there&#x27;s a free tool that lets me embed contact forms on any number of sites without writing code and just in a few steps, it would be great!

That&#x27;s where this 𝑓𝗈𝗋𝗆𝗂𝖿𝗒 idea came to me.

𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘂𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀:
1. Ability to add different emails for different forms to receive notification
2. Enhance the form script and add multiple color themes for users to select.
3. Email notification toggler for each form

Hope this formify application will be helpful to all those who want to add contact forms to their sites without much hassle. 💫

Please share your views/feedback about this product.

Thank you for stopping by 🙏

Have you ever been stuck or gone blank trying to solve a problem related to something that you just learned from YouTube or Google tutorials? You seem to understand every line of the code, but without the tutorial, you find yourself in a difficult position. If you have looked at problem-solving in HackerRank or LeetCode, you can relate to how an aspiring programmer feels seeing those challenges for the first time. Everything seems out of the box! Being unable to apply what you learned from a tutorial might make you doubt your knowledge and abilities as you begin to understand the basics of the programming language you&#x27;re learning.

eBooks provide a great way to read books, magazines, and other content on the go. Readers can enjoy eBooks to pass the time during long flights and train rides. The most popular eBook file format is the EPUB file, short for &quot;electronic publication.&quot; EPUB files are supported across a variety of eReaders and are effectively the standard for eBook publication today.
The EPUB file format is an open standard based on XHTML for content and XML for metadata, contained in a zip file archive. And because everything is based on open standards, we can use common tools to create or examine EPUB files. Let&#x27;s explore an EPUB file to learn more about it.

I&#x27;m a happy user of the XML-based Docbook markup language. To me, it&#x27;s a precise, explicit, and detailed system that allows me to have contextual and domain-specific metadata in what I write. Best of all, though, it can be transformed (that&#x27;s what XML users call it when XML is converted into another format) into nearly any format, including HTML, EPUB, FO for PDF, plain text, and more. With great power comes a lot of typing, though, and sometimes Docbook feels like it&#x27;s surplus to requirements. Luckily, there&#x27;s AsciiDoc, a system of writing plain text with the same markup-less feel of Markdown, but that transforms to Docbook to take advantage of its precision and flexibility.

Word processing files used to be closed, proprietary formats. In some older word processors, the document file was essentially a memory dump from the word processor. While this made for faster loading of the document into the word processor, it also made the document file format an opaque mess.
Around 2005, the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) group defined an open format for office documents of all types, the Open Document Format for Office Applications (ODF). You may also see ODF referred to as simply &quot;OpenDocument Format&quot; because it is an open standard based on the OpenOffice.org&#x27;s XML file specification. ODF includes several file types,…</span>

                              <span>某日在盗版网站上津津有味的看着《盗墓笔记重启之极海听雷》，翻着翻着，下一章文风突变，变成了《美艳总裁老婆的废柴入赘老公在家族聚会上送礼》的小故事，一时没把持住，看了600多章。我心想我阅读速度也不慢啊，咋感觉剧情进展这么慢，扫了一眼目录当场石化，好家伙，这文你都能水成2200章，真是要顶礼膜拜了。抽了自己几个大嘴巴以后，想了想还是总结一下为啥爽文是如此的让人无法自拔。咱今日不谈网络文学的好坏，就来聊聊这个「爽」。
爽感的对比
首先要自爆家底，这么多年「良好的阅读习惯」让我有幸接触了《斗破苍穹》、《武动乾坤》、《全职法师》、《牧龙师》、《七界传说》、《星辰变》、《盘龙》、《诛仙》、《盗墓笔记》、《鬼吹灯》等，应该也算是见证过当年网文的盛况，自认为对这一类型文有一定的发言权。
传统文学的爽感体验是以一种循序渐进的方式，缓慢而合理的推进剧情，不断累积读者的情绪和体验，最后在结局中以狂风暴雨般的方式宣泄出来。传统题材的小说也不会特意照顾读者感受，不会去刻意迎合读者口味。而网络爽文使用了一种截然不同的方式，彻底以读者为中心进行创作。读者爱看什么，作者就写什么，其目的只有一个：让读者看的爽。至此，网络文学凭借直白的叙事，通俗的文字，连绵不绝的爽快阅读体验，终于成为了文学作品中不可小觑的一种类型。
如果我们以阅读的进度作为x轴，将「爽」值作为Y轴，按照个人体验我画一张如下的图表（黄色为爽文，绿色为传统文学）。

画的比较抽象还望理解，既然要探究为什么爽文的爽会呈现出类似波浪线的形态，令人爽的难以自拔，可能得先从爽文的代入感说起。
爽感的地基：代入感
所谓代入，即读者以移情的方式，将自身转移到主角身上，从而间接获得主角的世界，以及在剧情推进中获得的各类体验。之所以强调代入感，就好比你隔壁是个富二代，你每天看着人家香车美女的生活必然只会觉得不爽，因为你跟他的生活毫无交集，他的爽你根本无法感同…</span>

前言
现在的应用，几乎每一个 App 都存在定位的逻辑，方便更好的推荐产品或服务，获取当前设备的经纬度是必备的功能了。有些 App 还是以LBS（基于位置服务）为基础来实现的，比如美团，饿了吗，不获取到位置都无法使用的。
有些同学觉得不就是获取到经纬度么，Android 自带的就有位置服务 LocationManager ，我们无需引入第三方服务，就可以很方便的实现定位逻辑。
确实 LocationManager 的使用很简单，获取经纬度很方便，我们就无需第三方的服务了吗？ 或者说 LocationManager 有没有坑呢？兼容性问题怎么样？获取不到位置有没有什么兜底策略？
一、LocationManager的使用
由于是Android的系统服务，直接 getSystemService 可以获取到
LocationManager locationManager &#x3D; (LocationManager) context.getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);

一般获取位置有两种方式 NetWork 与 GPS 。我们可以指定方式，也可以让系统自动提供最好的方式。
// 获取所有可用的位置提供器
List providerList &#x3D; locationManager.getProviders(true);
// 可以指定优先GPS，再次网络定位
if (providerList.contains(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER)) {
    provider &#x3D; LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER;

编译常见问题
在开发过程中，有碰到过一些由于编译优化导致的代码修改并不符合我们预期的情况。这也就是之前为什么我经常说编译产物其实是不太可以被信任的。
方法签名变更，底层仓库的方法变更但是上层模块并没有跟随一起重新编译导致的这个问题。
常量优化，将一些常量的调用点直接替换成常量的值。
删除空导包， 没有用的一些导包就会做一次剔除。
最近倒霉了
我们最近碰到一个pipeline相关而且很妖怪的问题。我们一个pipeline会检查apk产物中是否存在异常的方法调用，就是之前介绍的在R8的基础上开发出来的A8。但是最近有一个类被删除了之后呢，但是代码中还有一处调用点。但是这个检测竟然被通过了，然后这部分代码就被合入了master。

这个引用的文件就如上图所示，是一个debug buildType中的，所以并不是所有的apk中都会存在这部分代码。
然后呢，这个MergeRequest就被合入了master分支，因为当天是我们出下一个版本包的时间，然后交付给测试的就是全量编译的debug和release包。别的开发同学rebase完master之后就发现piepline都跑不过了，就导致了他们当天的代码无法被合入。
这个就是事情大概的起因和经过，但是各位有没有想过为什么会发生这个问题吗。这个是不是我们的pipeline出现了bug，导致了这种问题无法被识别出来了呢。
以前有说过，如果简单的说我们的快编系统就是把模块替换成对应的aar，从而达到编译提速。所以因为我们使用的是这个模块对应的aar产物，所以大概率就是因为这个模块的编译产物和源代码有差异导致了这个问题。
其实这个问题一出现我就已经知道大概率是由空导包优化导致的这个问题，因为在pipeline检查的时候，检测的apk产物中确实不存在这个导包。因为我们使用的是一个历史版本的aar，其中无效导包的部分已经被编译器做了删除空导包的优化了。接下来我们看下我写的一个demo中的无效导包。


图一呢是源代码java文件，图二呢则是jar包中的代码。可以简单的看出来行号呢是可以对应的上的，但是这个AppCompatActivity的无效导包在产物中已经被优化掉了。这里也就回答了在编译过程中会保留行号，但是也会优化掉一部分不需要的代码，让我们编译出来的产物更小。
所以也就导致了我们的产物和我们的源代码之间的差异，另外一个角度就是说从apk中我们确实是不存在这个类的导包。但是呢在我们把这部分代码重新编译成aar的时候，就会出现source缺失，导致的语法树无法生成，之后导致的编译失败问题。
这也就是所以我一直和大家说编译产物是不可以被信任的呢。
以前倒霉过
这个是之前的一个故事了，我们之前呢在模块中定义了一些静态常量吧，然后用来标识当前SDK的版本，然后这个值在别的模块中被引用到了。
有一次因为需求变更，我们更改了这个静态变量的值，然后呢我就把这个需求提测了。之后测试反馈给我为什么这边的这个值没有变化啊。

我的天，当时我就是这样，发生了什么情况。然后呢我全量打了个包好了，我当时也就以为只是编译时的一个bug而已。然后后来呢，我查了下资料发现这个就是一个java编译时的常量优化问题。过了一阵子吧，我面试了下字节跳动，然后我和面试官也聊了下这个话题，然后呢在这个方法签名变更的问题上，当时我略输一筹，哈哈哈哈。接下来我们就看下一个demo。


图1呢也是java代码，图2呢则是aar中的编译产物。其中我们可以看到，这个静态常量在编译成产物之后就会被编译成这样。
所以这个就解释了我一开始碰到的这个问题，他就是由于我们的编译器已经把aar中的这部分静态常量编译成了直接的值，然后呢我们的源变化之后如果没有重新编译对应的模块，就会导致这个值一直无法被更新到最新的值。
结论
如果大家对安卓编译相关有兴趣的话，这些问题很可能都会在面试的时候被问到。希望这不仅仅只是一篇我对于这些问题的思考，也能对各位有所帮助吧。</span>

前言
Transform API 是 AGP1.5 就引入的特性，主要用于在 Android 构建过程中，在 Class转Dex的过程中修改 Class 字节码。利用 Transform API，我们可以拿到所有参与构建的 Class 文件，然后可以借助ASM 等字节码编辑工具进行修改，插入自定义逻辑。
国内很多团队都或多或少的用 AGP 的 Transform API 来搞点儿黑科技，比如无痕埋点，耗时统计，方法替换等。但是在AGP7.0中Transform已经被标记为废弃了，并且将在AGP8.0中移除。
而Transrom被废弃之后，它的代替品则是Transform Action，它是由Gradle提供的产物变换API。
Transform API是由AGP提供的，而Transform Action则是由Gradle提供。不光是 AGP 需要 Transform，Java 也需要，所以由 Gradle 来提供统一的 Transform API 也合情合理。
当然如果你只是想利用ASM对字节码插桩，AGP提供了对基于TransformAction的ASM插桩的封装，只需要使用AsmClassVisitorFactory即可，关于具体的使用可见：Transform 被废弃，ASM 如何适配?
而本文主要包括以下内容:
TransformAction是什么?
如何自定义TransformAction

TransformAction是什么？
简单来说，TransformAction就是Gradle提供的产物转换API，可以注册两个属性间的转换Action，将依赖从一个状态切换到另一个状态

1. 接口存在的意义？
在 Dart 中 接口 定义并没有对应的关键字。可能有些人觉得 Dart 中弱化了 接口 的概念，其实不然。我们一般对接口的理解是：接口是更高级别的抽象，接口中的方法都是 抽象方法 ，没有方法体。通过接口的定义，我们可以通过定义接口来声明功能，通过实现接口来确保某类拥有这些功能。
不过你有没有仔细想过，为什么接口会存在，引入接口的概念是为了解决什么问题？可能有人会说，通过接口，可以规范一类事物的功能，可以面向接口进行操作，从而可以更加灵活地进行拓展。其实这只是接口的作用，而且这些功能 抽象类 也可以支持。所以接口一定存在什么特殊的功能，是抽象类无法做到的。
都是抽象方法的抽象类，和接口有什么本质的区别呢？在我的初入编程时，这个问题就伴随着我，但渐渐地，这个问题好像对编程没有什么影响，也就被遗忘了。网上很多文章介绍 抽象类 和 接口 的区别，只是在说些无关痛痒的形式区别，并不能让我觉得接口存在有什么必要性。
思考一件事物存在的本质意义，可以从没有这个事物会产生什么后果来分析。现在想一下，如果没有接口，一切的抽象行为仅靠 抽象类 完成会有什么局限性 或说 弊端。没有接口，就没有  实现 (implements)  的概念，其实这就等价于在问 implements 消失了，对编程有什么影响。没有实现，类之间就只能通过 继承 (extends) 来维护 is-a 的关系。所以就等价于在问 extends 有什么局限性 或说 弊端。答案呼之欲出：多继承的二义性 。
那问题来了，为什么类不能支持 多继承 ，而接口可以支持 多实现 ，继承 和 实现 有什么本质的区别呢？为什么 实现 不会带来 二义性 的问题，这是理解接口存在关键。

                              <span>写在前面
30 岁，有人开始发现自己不再年轻，有人开始焦虑自己的目标、成功和失败，30 岁在 20 岁看来也许觉得好笑，在 40 岁看来也许又觉得矫情。不管怎么说，我的 30 岁还是来了。
在我派发这篇文章时，已是我在 30 岁路上的第 5 天，此刻才有时间写点东西。

论写生日小作文，我最佩服《失控》的作者凯文凯利（KK）。68 岁生日，他写下 68 Bits of Unsolicited Advice，给出了自己 68 岁时的 68 条忠告。69 岁生日，他写下了 99 Additional Bits of Unsolicited Advice，给出了自己 69 岁的 99 条忠告。今年等来了他 70 岁生日主题文 103 Bits of Advice I Wish I Had Known。嚯，这次直接增加到了 103 条。

崇拜谁就模仿谁，所以很早之前我给自己定下过 30 岁写 30 条感悟的目标。嗯，如你所见，没写出来。还是熊言熊语，随便聊聊。

也许
29 岁最后一天和 30 岁第一天的我们不会有多少质的变化。真正让我们成熟的是那些生活和其中为数不多的经历，或让人恍然大悟，或让人追悔莫及，或让人晕头转向，也可能让人继续前行。
有些人 30 岁的经历你可能在 20 岁已经习得，有些人 30 岁的感受你可能要等到 40 岁才有所体会。
许久没联系的发小前几天微信问我作为三旬老汉有何感受。我这个发小本科毕业 7 年时间里先后换了三份工作，英年早婚，孩子已经能打酱油，如今安家在一个南方城市。我猜他不是真心求教，便说：读书读的太久了，才开始感受社会的暴击。
他回复我：很好，那就不用我了，生活能教你做个人。

29 岁这一年，当我拿到一本建行绿色「个人住房抵押贷款合同」，翻开 X00 万贷款还款 30 年那一页时，脑子里突然冒出了万青的一句歌词：如此生活 30 年，直到大厦…</span>

                              <span>虽然裸辞以后收入不能保证，也中断了自己的职业生涯，但是这一年，从每天晚上规划「明天干吗好呢」开始，我发现自己是可以掌控生活的。
我可以决定自己每一天要不要工作、要不要提升自己、要不要追寻快乐，不管做了什么选择，我都不再抱怨，而且珍惜时间。
比起在公司常常不好意思拒绝他人、被kpi追着跑、看不清大局，我在与自己的相处过程中，似乎渐渐明白「为自己的选择负责」，意味着什么。
不断为时间做决策的过程，也是不断地自我验证。
我更清楚自己擅长、缺失、喜爱、抗拒的事物，根据自己的评估，补上了一些所需技能，也放任自己不勉强接受抗拒的东西，让生活状态尽量保持在「心情不错且有收获」的可持续流动中。
最幸运的是，身边的人不会觉得我很奇怪，写稿技能也在市场上获得回馈。
所以以下是给自己的一年期交代～涵盖这一年的时间安排(多图表预警)、转自由职业体悟、生活创作和心境转变，共4300+字，来不及看先收藏或打赏(喂)也行。
 
一、裸辞后的时间都干吗去了？
在去年6月底离职前，我有4年全职工作经验，媒体编辑，大体是个没什么生活的人。
辞职以后，我大致经历了休养→探索→认命→前进四个阶段：

7-10月 休养期
架了个人网站、从0到1启动单口播客、整理生活(相册/收藏夹等)、看书
裸辞前身体较差，给自己的唯一kpi是「全然地休息」，不着急确定下一步

11月-1月 探索期
随着收入渐少，有去面试，但没有想上班的心情，觉得自己可能要主动做点什么
因此找了喜欢的健身领域，每周工作三天，其他几天继续探索不同可能
顺便回家一趟，经历两岸隔离28+14天

2月-3月 认命期
明晰了自己只是不想浪费时间在反复沟通而非工作本身，因此认命接受自由职业
开始拓展自由职业客户来源，或者说让更多人知道我可以做什么

4月-6月 前进期
封控在家两个月，尝试接触更多客户、完成不同稿子


 
从数据上看，收入曲线 (图一) 也…</span>

                              <span>本文参与数字文具盒征文活动。

我是一个在读的社科博士生。大约一年多以前，我正式进入到博士研究的阶段。很快我发现，博士与硕士本科阶段不同，我面临着文章发表的压力却又缺乏充分的导师指导，由此我开始认真思考如何建立自己的知识管理与任务管理系统。感谢少数派上众多热心作者的分享，让我在这一年里了解并尝试了各种各样的笔记工具、任务管理工具以及方法论体系，并成功浪费了大量学习时间。
然而，虽然每次看到喜欢的新工具都会马上下载使用，我却总是难以坚持下来。在经历了无数次的尝试-放弃循环后，我发觉最重要的不是工具本身，而是容纳这些工具的「盒子」——即如何最简单明了地将文件管理、项目管理、知识管理等等工具融合在一起。
但恰恰是这些基础的东西，大部分的分享都没有详细提及，它们可能没有什么技术含量，但却是入门者最最需要的。因此，我想和大家分享一下我是如何将 Mac 桌面作为我的数字文具盒，搭建简易数字化学术工作流程的，或许能对刚开始入门的朋友有所帮助。
首先谈谈一个普遍存在的问题：

为什么我看到某某博主介绍的某款笔记工具非常酷炫，非常符合自己的需求，但是就是用不下去呢？

可能有这几方面的原因：

工具学习成本过高，难以上手。
工具与自己正在使用的工具功能、工作习惯冲突，无法完全融入到自己的工作流中。
自己太懒工具使用需要耗费时间精力，没有养成使用习惯，产生拖延。

就我自己的探索经历来说，这几方面的问题一般共同存在。
举个例子，初次知道 logseq 这个双链笔记应用的时候，我觉得它就是完美的笔记工具，于是马上下载试用，每天在它的 dailynote 里面记录各种各样的东西，包括每日任务、未来计划、会议记录、研究灵感、阅读笔记，项目总结等等，然后用双链加以整理。
但是一段时间后发现，它和之前的工具产生了冲突。比如我的文献 pdf 是用 Zotero 来管理的，这就导致每次查阅文献都要同时打开两…</span>

一个个小问题堆出棘手大问题
同学们好，我是 AZ，AZ 是我。作为一个在「文理学院」上学、学的是两个本身就是跨专业学科的双专业学生，要学的知识范围实在是广到自己都数不明白的程度。从专业本身的基因和数据科学，到分子生物和计算机、有机化学和统计概率、生物工程和数据伦理，再到学院要求的国际关系、文学写作、历史艺术，有至少一半都是超出我已有的知识框架的内容。这些《乱七八糟》的东西一股脑丢过来，基本上摔在地上的和接住且拿住的五五开。为了自己的学业（aka 绩点），也为了自己越来越重的黑眼圈和越来越秃的脑袋，得想想办法。
AZ 的学习工作流 &amp; 关于工作流的思考
工作流，顾名思义，是一套能胜任一系列需求的「数字文具」使用范式。但作为一个被迫要学文科社科工科计算机还有设计的理科生，似乎没有一套这样的范式能很好的适配所有的学科。作为一个很不喜欢和生态逆行的人，我尝试过但无法适应同时使用过多的平台来做信息的储存和处理，因而在很长的一段时间每当我看到新的软件出现下意识的第一反应都是「我在 Notion 里能怎么实现这个功能」。到现在，我绝大部分的信息，不管是生活相关的、学业相关的、还是课外活动相关的，都有条不紊的排列在我的 Notion 里。
但是回到最开始提到的问题上，虽然我很爱 Notion 觉得 Notion 功能非常的强大也把大量的信息托付给这个平台，不得不承认，Notion …</span>

2019 年，导演李一凡拍摄了三年的纪录片在广东时代美术馆上映。随后，这部名为《杀马特我爱你》的片子在网上掀起热烈讨论。豆瓣上有影评这样写道：「还没有一部纪录片可以像《杀马特我爱你》让我这么感动，以致于看到中间，我不自觉地拿起手机拼命的记笔记，生怕遗漏掉其中每一段杀马特充满力量的表达，那些关于自由、关于快乐、关于压迫的生命哲学表达。」这部影片也成为印象中「叛逆的、非主流、亚文化」杀马特群体祛魅的代表作。
与之类似的，由 B 站 UP 主衣戈猜想发布的视频作品《二舅》近期也掀起不小的舆论波澜，从立意到故事本身的真伪都饱受讨论。我们不去剥丝抽茧论证事件本身的真实度，但从画风上来看，它在拍摄手法上也使用了田野民族志的方式。
相比已经成为亚文化符号的「杀马特」，类似「二舅」这样传奇又曲折的人格与经历，不曾像如今这般立于舆论场的镁光灯下。无论看完之后会生出怎样的感受：是疼痛、同情、喟叹或哑然、无感、内心矛盾，这都是一场对乡土生活的祛魅的过程。
它背后的传播母题是怎样的？我们又要如何理解「苦难符号」与情感动员之间的关系？一地鸡毛的舆论场冷却之后，比起片子里讲了什么，还有哪些欲语还休的留白更值得讨论？
我们与故事的距离：「影像真实」争议背后的共性价值
7 月末，《二舅》这个 11 分钟的视频在网络上窜火。不到一个礼拜，公众讨论的话题从文案的精妙、背后的社会议题，再到内容本身的真假。从情怀到打假背后，是不断翻新的衍生讨论，不限于精神内耗、乡土风味、非虚构写作的边界等等。
从传播的角度出发，我们首先需要明确的是：作为观众，我们与作品的距离不等于我们与故事本身的距离。我们首先接触到的层面，始终是「影像真实」。
有网友对此评述：二舅的出现的确改变了我一些看待人性生活的方式。一个治愈当下的故事，如果其内核被抽丝剥茧，被现实解读，那么故事便不再是故…</span>

🔥 Hi，我是小彭。本文已收录到 GitHub · AndroidFamily 中。这里有 Android 进阶成长知识体系，有志同道合的朋友，关注公众号 [彭旭锐] 带你建立核心竞争力。
前言
Bitmap 是 Android 应用的内存占用大户，是最容易造成 OOM 的场景。为此，Google 也在不断尝试优化 Bitmap 的内存分配和回收策略，涉及：Java 堆、Native 堆、硬件等多种分配方案，未来会不会有新的方案呢？
深入理解 Bitmap 的内存模型是有效开展图片内存优化的基础，在这篇文章里，我将深入 Android 6.0 和 Android 8.0 系统源码，为你总结出不同系统版本上的 Bitmap 运行时内存模型，以及 Bitmap 使用的 Native 内存回收兜底策略。 知其然，知其所以然，开干！
这篇文章是 Android UI 开发系列图片专题文章第 6 篇，专题文章列表：
1、图片控件：ImageView &amp; Drawable &amp; Bitmap 的关系
2、ImageView 使用详解
3、Bitmap 使用详解
4、Drawable 详解
5、资源图片加载过程
6、Bitmap 内存分配和回收
7、图片解码过程
8、Bitmap 复用机制
9、Bitmap 硬件位图
10、计算图片内存占用
11、常见图片格式
12、图片优化概述
13、图片优化：NativeBitmap
14、图片优化：大图加载
15、图片优化：大图检测
16、图片优化：图片慢响应排查
学习路线图：

1. 认识 Bitmap 的内存模型
1. 不同版本的 Bitmap 内存分配策略
先说一下 Bitmap 在内存中…</span>

前言
前面几篇文章我们讲解了关于关于Gradle的基础，Gradle生命周期，Gradle相关Api的讲解，以及Gradle自定义插件
Gradle系列文章如下：
Gradle筑基篇：
Gradle筑基篇(一)-Gradle初探
Gradle筑基篇(二)-Groovy语法的详解
Gradle筑基篇(三)-Gradle生命周期
Gradle筑基篇(四)-Gradle APi详解
Gradle筑基篇(五)-Gradle自定义插件实战
Gradle筑基篇(六)-Gradle Maven仓库管理
Gradle进阶篇
Gradle进阶篇(六)-AGP详解
现如今已经不是以前单兵作战时代，越来越多的需求，促使我们项目去实现动态组件化开发。
这个时候组件化发布共享就显的尤为重要。
这篇文章我们就来讲解下如何使用Maven进行组件化发布
在讲解组件化发布之前，我们先来了解一些基础概念
基础概念：
1.POM
pom:全名Project Object Model 项目对象模型，用来描述当前maven项目发布模块的基础信息
pom主要节点信息如下：
配置
描述
举例（&#x27;com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.1&#x27;）




groupId
组织 / 公司的名称
com.android.tools.build


artifactId
组件的名称
gradle


version
组件的版本
4.1.1


packaging
打包的格式
aar



2.仓库
我们在开发中经常使用到第二/三方插件或者第二/三方库，就是存储在仓库中的

但是对于大图查看，通常在外界展示的是一张缩略图，点开之后放大就是原图，如果图片很大，OOM发生也是正常的，因此在加载大图的时候，可以看下面这张图

一张图片如果很大，在手机屏幕中并不能完全展示，那么其实就没有必要讲图片完全加载进来，而是可以采用分块加载的方式，只展示显示的那一部分，当图片向上滑动的时候，之前展示的区域内存能够复用，不需要开辟新的内存空间来承接新的模块，从而达到了大图的治理的目的。
1 自定义大图View
像在微信中点击查看大图，查看大图的组件就是一个自定义View，能够支持滑动、拖拽、放大等功能，因此我们也可以自定义一个类似于微信的大图查看器，从中了解图片加载优化的魅力

前言
共享内存（shared memory）是最常见的ipc进程之间通讯的方式之一了，很多linux书籍上，都将共享内存评价为“最有用的ipc机制”，就连Binder机制盛行的android体系，同样也离不开共享内存的应用！在所以ipc方式中，共享内存以“快”赢得了很多开发者的掌声，我们下面深入看看！
共享内存相关函数

首先讲到共享内存，那么肯定离不开要介绍几个函数
shmget
int shmget(key_t key, size_t size, int shmflg);

shmget函数用来获取一个内存区的ipc标识，这个标识在内核中，属于一个身份标识符号（ipc标识符，正常情况下是不会重复的，但是标识符也有限制的，比如linux2.4最大为32768，用完了就会重新计算），通过shmget调用，会返回给我们当前的ipc标识，如果这个共享内存区本来就不存在，就直接创建，否则就把当前标识直接返回给我们！说了一大堆，其实很简单，就相当于给我们返回了一个代表该共享内存的标识罢了！
shmat
void *shmat(int shmid, const void *shmaddr, int shmflg);

shmat把一个共享内存区域添加到进程上，我们之前在mmap这一章节有提到过线性区的概念，就是进程可用的一组地址（可以用，但是用的时候才真正分配），而shmat就把共享内存的这块地址，通过（shmid   shmget可以获取到的）放到了进程中的可用地址范围内，用范围内的合适地址（shmaddr这里指进程想要发生映射的可用地址）指向了共享内存实际的地址，可以见上图！
shmdt
int shmdt(const void *shmaddr);

用于从当前进程把指定的共享内存sh…</span>

实现一个类似天猫sku选择页的滑动效果


实现

基于AppBarLayout+CollapsingToolbarLayout实现

相关基础能力

�CoordinatorLayout�
他是一个高级版的FrameLayout容器，他可以通过Behavior处理内部View之间的嵌套滑动

Behavior
他通过关联联动View和被联动View，在联动View发生滑动时，通知Behavior从而触发被联动View的响应，他主要包含以下几个方法：
onStartNestedScroll：嵌套滑动开始，一般通过parent view的类型确定behavior是否要监听滑动
onNestedPreScroll：嵌套滑动中，要监听的parentView 即将开始滑动，滑动事件还未消费
onNestedScroll：嵌套滑动中，要监听的parentView 即将开始滑动，滑动事件已消费
onStopNestedScroll：嵌套滑动结束

AppBarLayout
AppBarlayout默认实现了AppBarLayout.Behavior，当与其组合的滚动布局（RecycleView、NestedScrollView等）设置了app:layout_behavior&#x3D;&quot;@string/appbar_scrolling_view_behavior&quot;，他就根据设置的滚动标识（app:layout_scrollFlags）响应滚动布局的滚动做出响应。
滚动标识有：
scroll：布局的滚动与滚动事件直接相关。需要设置此标志才能使下面的其他标志生效。
exitUntilCollapsed：当你给布局定义了一个minHeight，此布局将在滚动到达这个最小高度的时候折叠。
enterAlways：任何的向下滚动都会让view出现，这个标识通常用于“快速返回”模式

一、展示效果
本次实战项目，利用Android中的距离传感器，开发一个小猪睡觉的趣味应用，靠近小猪，它就睡觉；你一离开，它就作妖。可用于哄娃，效果如下：

二、源码放送
xml布局中只有一个居中的ImageView图片，用于显示小猪图片，此处就不再赘述了。
重点把Activity里的代码，给大家展示一下。

本文参与数字文具盒征文活动。

少数派一直是高效率人士最爱的分享平台之一，我也喜欢在工作的闲暇之余学习别人的效率技巧，或者是体验新出的效率 app，也逐渐形成了自己的一套科研工作流。最近浏览少数派中数字文具盒的征文，很多同学的学习方法我都非常认可，并且能够在我的科研生活中找到相似的影子。想来也是该总结总结我三年的经验了，既是反思自己这些年的工作流是否合理，也可借此机会和大家分享讨论何为有效的「学术生活」。
作为一个普通双一流的土博，毕业的主要条件是论文，所以这三年来我的主要工作便是尽可能地多产出成果。但是在此之前，我是没有接受过系统化的科研训练的，并且为了匹配导师团队的研究方向，我几乎是从零开始学习相关知识，笔记的重要性日渐凸显。经过1年多的探索和自我怀疑（以及摸鱼混日子），我终于在博二开始有了一点点产出，在国内的学术会议上口头汇报自己的工作，自此之后，论文对我来说也不再是遥不可及的高峰。当然这离不开导师的悉心指导与团队的帮助，但是我自以为我的工作流帮助并加速了成果产出，不至于即将毕业的我简历还是一片空白。
那么我就从知识的输入、沉淀与输出来谈谈我的学术工作流吧，其中绝大多数方法并不是只有科研工作者才能使用，我相信，只要是喜欢学习的人，整理知识的目的一定是殊途同归的。希望接下来的内容能够给大家带来一点点启发。
知识的输入
之前说到，我在博一期间研究的内容几乎都是首次接触，所以大量的基础知识学习便是期间最主要的工作。感谢当今学术圈乐于分享和讨论的氛围，我所在领域——复杂网络研究——各方面工作都有前人完整的论述与著作（对复杂网络感兴趣…</span>

本文参与数字文具盒征文活动。

因为去年写了这篇文章分享我的 workflow，所以在这次的征文题目公布时，少数派的编辑也贴心的来问我有没有想分享的工具。说实话，对于这次的征文题目，我是喜忧参半：喜的是可以期待一波好工具的分享，满足我对工具的探索欲； 忧的是对工具探索的过度好奇往往会占用额外的时间和精力，反而加剧了我的论文写作拖延症。 相信很多少数派的读者和我一样，对于新的工具总是充满好奇，迫不及待地探索一番后，又很快搁置到一边， 真正能用下去的工具往往还是那几个常用的。
我想，造成此类现象的原因可能有以下几个：

一些工具虽然有全新的名字和界面，但是功能往往与已有的工具重合，并不能给工作效率带来实质帮助；
对于一些工具类软件而言，开发新的功能毕竟困难，于是转而希望努力改变或者教导用户一套新的方法论或使用逻辑。然而，愿景虽好，但这往往并没有从用户的实际需要出发，反而带来了过高的学习成本；
工具自身的缺陷问题：譬如平台覆盖不足，导入导出不够开放，系统不够稳定，字体不够大，等等；
工具本身提供了简单且实用的功能，但是介绍中并没有提供实际的应用场景，所以有时不知如何将之纳入自己的工作流中进行合理使用；
个人主观的好恶。

当然，作为一个不懂任何工具开发的文科菜鸟，我自然也没有资格吹毛求疵，对工具大加评判。在本文中，我只想从一个长期用户的实际使用体验出发，分享一些我实际研究学习过程中真正用到的一些工具，希望为你带来一点点参考。
另外，我每天用到的学术工具首先包括 DEVONthink、Obisidian、Zotero 和 Scrivene…</span>

                              <span>前言
我是阿杜，目前在开发一款笔记类应用 岁月笔记 。2020 年苹果推出过一个「轻 App (App Clips)」功能，让我们不需要下载安装 也能使用，号称苹果版小程序；
但是时至今日一直被当做APP的阉割版，作为苹果公司推出的系统级小程序,或许有更酷的交互方式；
正好做的APP内有个信件模块，用户写好信件后分享生成图片，这样交互太呆板了，不太友好；可以利用AppClip，把信件写入NFC卡片，让手机靠近NFC，弹出信件卡片！
效果如下👇🏻

原理
其实原理也很简单，就是把信件编辑好写入NFC，然后卡片调起信件；

NFC只要是苹果支持的DNEF数据格式的白卡都可以,某多多上有卖的；
刚开始是这样的
白卡
然后设计图案后，交由厂家打印成卡贴后贴在 NFC 卡片上。

外观
只有一个卡片也不太拿得出手，所以给它设计了一个盒子
外包装

                              <span>万万没想到，时隔多年我又开始用上了QQ。
起因是需要打包一些软件给朋友，发微信超过了200M限制，好不容易传上了网盘，朋友那边的下载速度却只有几十k。我实在没辙了，朋友突然提议说——为何不在QQ传给他？
QQ？
我已经卸载好多年了。这个一路承载了我青春回忆的应用，却在我年龄渐长后变成了不堪回首的过往，转而封锁空间、卸载停用。
只能偶尔在媒体上了解到其主力军已经变成了00后，且功能越来越花里胡哨。最新版本更是因为搭配虚幻4引擎、大小达到800M，而被戏称为腾讯3A大作。
朋友这次提起，我才知道原来QQ传送文件竟没有大小限制，速度也很快，连钉钉都有限制大小，QQ竟这么勇的吗？好奇心驱使我去下载了最新的8.9.3版本来体验，意外发现如今的QQ还真有许多妙用，当然槽点也不少，且听我细细道来。

聊天斗图很过瘾
在微信斗图时是不是常苦恼表情包不够？在QQ这里完全没这种烦恼！
在聊天输入框搜索，就会弹出表情，不用像微信一样单独去搜，搜图贼快！

如果你连表情都懒得搜，QQ还能智能帮你斗图！这在QQ叫“怼图”，即聊天中如果 20 秒内连续出现三次图片即可触发怼图标记，点击一下标记，系统就会根据对方发的表情自动帮你斗图，简直不要太爽。

如果这还不够过瘾，QQ还有招！
长按常规表情包，可以触发弹射功能，届时就能看到满屏幕的表情乱飞，看着就很解压。

可能是觉得表情包停留在视觉动效，还不足以抚平年轻人躁动的心，所以QQ还增加了触感的刺激。选择“戳一戳”好友，不同的动作会让手机产生不同节奏的震动，交互很爽。

如果觉得公共表情不够独特，你也可以自己捏脸换装，生成专属形象的表情包，也十分地酷。

表情方面很多玩法，语音上也放开了限制。
微信语音上限为60秒，而QQ语音可达到120秒，与之配套的还有语音进度条，想拖到哪都行，也支持变音。
 （感激微信最多支持60秒语音，不然对于经常收到长辈关爱语音…</span>

                              <span>之前我分享过2T容量的M.2 SSD固态硬盘，其标称速度达到了7400MB/s。由于其发烧级别的价格，让许多小伙伴都无法接受。其实当时我也在想，难道就不能降一个规格吗？比如用5000MB/s的SSD固盘，难道PS5主机会真的无法识别？还是说速度上会有较大的影响呢。
这次我从朋友那入了一条大华的C970 SSD固态硬盘，本来是装机用的，现在先拿来测试一下在PS5主机内的情况，希望能解开各位小伙伴的疑问。

关于主机的空间拓展

PS5主机内部大概是825GB的存储空间，实际可用约为677.2GB容量。以现今PS5游戏的容量来说，随便安装10个游戏都满了，特别是开了第二档会员后。幸好PS5提供了内置M.2 SSD扩充槽，可以增加主机的存储容量。

对于M.2 SSD的规格是否有要求？

翻阅官方说明可以看到，PS5的内置M.2 SSD的规格需要M插槽类型，长度支持2230、2242、2260、2280、22110，单面或者双面M.2 SSD均可，存储大小在250GB至4TB，建议连续读取速度达5500MB/s或更高。换句话说，就是推荐采用PCIe Gen4.0x4传输模式，速度能达到5500MB/s以上，容量4TB以下的SSD固态硬盘 。

出于对热散的需求，PlayStation 5也支持带有M.2 SSD散热“马甲”的固态硬盘安装，只不过整体厚度不能超过11.25mm。

那么是不是速度达到5500MB/s以上的M2.SSD就可以了呢？在此官方特意作出了说明。“不能保证所有符合所述规格的 M.2 SSD设备都能与您的主机配合使用，并且不对第三方产品的选择、性能或使用承担任何责任。”因此建议在选购前，先关注各个厂家的官方介绍，或者看一下用户实际体验，是否支持PS5主机。

这次咱们就用大华C970 1TB SSD固态硬盘（以下简称大华C970 SSD固态硬盘）来测试一下，究竟…</span>

最近我写东西时遇到了一些阻碍。这些问题可能你也遇到过。

想写的内容已经有人写过了，没有写的动力了，怎么办？
总觉得自己的想法和经历不值得分享出来，去浪费别人的时间。
花了时间和精力写出来了，但阅读量和反馈都很一般，信心因此被打击。

总结下来就是，我想写的，别人已经写过了；我不想写的，写着也没意思；想写的，写不清楚，别人看不懂。完了，不想写作了。
这些问题都会有一个共性矛盾，就是我带入了「别人」这个角色。「别人」已经看过的，「别人」可能不喜欢，担心浪费「别人」的时间。我们去担心「别人」，然后把不想写作的问题归咎在对自己的不自信。
但这只是一种托辞。
其实，我们创作欲的敌人不是「不自信」，而是对「面向自己写作」与「面向读者写作」这两个概念的混淆——该面向自己写的时候，念着别人；该面向别人去写的时候，觉得应该坚持自己。

面向自己写作：为了自己的求知欲、表达欲而写；
面向读者写作：为了解决读者的需求，写读者关心的内容。

是为自己写，还是为读者写？之前的我总是在这天平的两端来回摇摆。
一、我的写作经历
1.1 面向读者写作
最早启发我「写作方法」的是罗辑思维和得到，他们以「通过知识服务，为用户节约时间」的理念打磨内容，当时作为用户，我觉得这样的内容特别受用。而这种以服务的姿态来交付内容的理念，一直影响着我的写作。当时的我，觉得做内容其实就是把别人的知识，用清晰的结构（故事引入-结论先行-展开论证-结尾升华）加上简单易懂的大白话来呈现给读者就行。
我也用类似的思路对接老板的朋友打磨短内容，制作课程，写知识干货的文章，组建内容小组…</span>

                              <span>如果你持续关注这几年的新播客，不难发现几乎每周都会有品牌开设播客的动态。去年，我们还在探讨品牌播客能否成为品牌传播矩阵的标配，但如今不断增长的品牌播客已经在用事实说明，该探讨的不再只是「为什么品牌要做播客？」，还应该包括「如何做好品牌播客？」通过这几年积累的案例，我们从播放数据、节目形态等方面进行提炼，给出这份品牌播客避坑指南。
 不断扩张的品牌播客队伍   

创立播客的国内品牌主要由两部分组成：一部分是新消费品牌，一部分是各行各业的头部企业。拥有较为充足的市场预算，对于传播媒介非常敏感，拥有持续内容创作的资源，最重要的是都有建立品牌形象的需求。

在广告预算大幅缩减的环境下，许多大公司都在今年陆续进场，比如特斯拉、仲量联行、摩登天空等，都在近期开设了品牌播客。一些早期入局的品牌还在持续投入，Withinlink碚曦投资协作体出品的「贝望录」、GGV纪源资本的「创业内幕」都已规律更新超过三年。
部分2022年开播的品牌播客
经过对于近三年品牌播客的梳理，不难发现创立播客的国内品牌主要由两部分组成：一部分是新消费品牌，一部分是各行各业的头部企业。拥有较为充足的市场预算，对于传播媒介非常敏感，拥有持续内容创作的资源，最重要的是都有建立品牌形象的需求。
品牌播客成为近期的内容趋势，有三个很重要的原因：
播客市场认知不断提升，走出隐秘的角落。这点从微信指数上不难看出，去年7月31日指数为41万，今年同比翻了一倍，今年7月6日甚至猛增到了1222万。这背后可能是TME、Spotify在播客领域的持续布局，越来越多的名人大咖入场，但无论原因是什么，播客都在走进越来越多人的视野，成为不能忽视的媒介。
品牌播客也有盈利空间，并非纯投入。品牌播客也可以为其他品牌打广告，乍一听并不是件可行的事，但实际已经在发生。因为想要让受众听完一期节目，首先不能一听就是广告宣传，这样很容易劝退，内容必须足…</span>
