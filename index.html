                              <span>SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. SQLite is the most widely deployed SQL database engine in the world. The source code for SQLite is in the public domain.
SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a small (~350 KB) C programming library. In contrast to other database management systems, SQLite is not a separate process that is accessed from the client application, but an integral part of it.
SQLite is ACID-compliant and implements most of the SQL standard, using a dynamically and weakly typed SQL syntax that does not guarantee the domain integrity.
SQlite is commonly used to store data on Android, iOS, and Windows Phone apps since it has a simple implementation, easy to adapt, and quite fast.
Unlike client-server database management systems, the SQLite engine has no standalone processes with which the application program communicates. Instead, the SQLite library is linked in and thus becomes an integral part of the application program.
The application program uses SQLite&#x27;s functionality through simple function calls, which reduce latency in database access: function calls within a single process are more efficient than inter-process communication. SQLite stores the entire database as a single cross-platform file on a host machine.

You can find Cards used in a wide range of scenarios ranging from user profiles, event information, project portfolio, and more.

Before we start writing any code, let&#x27;s take a closer look at the Card to identify the fields and parts of the Card.  
From the card design, we notice there are five sections of the Card:

                              <span>If you know dbt, then this post is to help you learn the core concepts of Terraform using the same mental model you use for dbt. You&#x27;ll see where they&#x27;re similar and how you can apply the paradigms you use in dbt to Terraform!
Why? Because making connections between what you&#x27;re learning and something you already know is an effective way to wrap your head around that new topic.
If you know neither, some of the comparisons might seem abstract, but that&#x27;s okay! You&#x27;ll hopefully get an understanding of the patterns and ecosystems around both that will make learning either exponentially easier.
In the past five years, two libraries have fundamentally changed the game in their respective spaces: Terraform for cloud infrastructure and dbt for data transformations.

If your system doesn&#x27;t have Perl, Perl is needed to be installed.
See Perl Download and Installation on Perl ABC to install Perl on Windows/Mac/Linux/Unix.
SPVM is a static typed language that can be used from Perl. SPVM is the essential part of the Python/numpy porting to Perl. If you haven&#x27;t heard of Perl&#x27;s SPVM. Please see also SPVM Language Specification. 
Growth is expected in the fields of Bio Tech, AI/ML, Apple/iPhone/iPad Apps, Google/Android Apps, IoT Device, Connected Car, Smart Device, Smart Home, etc.
This is because SPVM can produce an executable file that supports cross platforms and make easy to calculate arrays and bind C/C++ and Nvidia/GPU/cuda.

The day has finally come: famed pokémon trainer Ash Ketchum is the very best. The moment, 25 seasons in the making, happened earlier this morning in the latest episode of the Netflix series Pokémon Ultimate Journeys, when Ash won the “Masters Eight Tournament of the Pokémon World Coronation Series,” making him the top trainer in the world. The episode aired first in Japan and will be coming to the rest of the world “in the future.”


As fans of the Pokémon animated series already know, being the very best, like no one ever was, has always been the goal for Ash and his pal Pikachu since the show debuted in 1997. Just look how happy he looks holding that trophy. If nothing else, the win is a great lesson in perseverance. There’s currently...

Okay, so Twitter broke its own verification system by making the blue check — previously a signal that the account had provided information about its owner’s identity — available for purchase. Yesterday, which is approximately a month ago in Elon Musk time, a solution rolled out: gray checks that indicated that the account was official. By the end of the day, those checks had been rolled back.
Got all that? Great. After a great deal of impersonation, hoaxing, and other brand-unsafe behavior from the newly-purchased blue checks, the gray “official” checks are back.
Brands such as Coca-Cola, Twitter, Wired, and Ars Technica have the new-old gray checks (but not @Verge, which is, we promise, our real one, unlike this impostor account). This...

Elon Musk seems intent on turning Twitter into a bank, complete with what he describes as a “high-yield money market account,” debit cards, checks, and loans. He described his plans during a last-minute meeting with staff today, and you can read a full transcript of that here.
Musk broached the topic of payments during his introduction, saying that “I think there’s this transformative opportunity in payments,” adding that the goal is “enabling people on Twitter to able to send money anywhere in the world instantly and in real-time. We just want to make it as useful as possible.” He said that the feature, along with “video content and compensating content creators” and improving search, is a “high priority.”

据报道，Chrome、Safari、Firefox 和其他浏览器都接受一家名为 TrustCor 的根证书机构（CA）。CA 是互联网基础设施的基石，它签署的 SSL 证书可以保证网站不是假的，流量是加密的。因而，CA 可以签发“伪造”证书从而劫持加密流量。此外，该公司在巴拿马的注册记录显示，其信息与今年被确认的一家的间谍软件制造商相同，文件显示，该公司十多年来一直向美国政府机构出售通信拦截服务。Mozilla 表示它可能会取消 TrustCor 的根证书。

老王点评：谷歌当年就因为有根 CA 滥用而取消过该根 CA 证书，看看这次谷歌会如何？




GitHub 实验 “Hey, GitHub!” 语音编程

GitHub Next 团队宣布了一项新的实验：“Hey, GitHub!”，允许与 Copilot 进行语音互动。也就是说，你甚至不需要使用键盘就可以让 VSCode 为你提供编程建议。GitHub 称，该实验可以识别“自然语言”。除了编写和编辑代码，它还允许程序员进行代码导航和执行其它 VSCode 命令。

美国国家安全局敦促各组织转向内存安全编程语言

美国国家安全局（NSA）表示，建议各组织通过利用 C#、Go、Java、Ruby 或 Swift 等语言内存安全编程语言进行战略性转变。NSA 表示“内存管理问题已经被利用了几十年，今天仍然很常见。”软件内存安全问题是约 70% 的漏洞背后的原因。不良的内存管理也会导致技术问题，如不正确的程序结果，随着时间的推移程序性能的下降，以及程序崩溃。

                              <span>VLC 媒体播放器是 最好的媒体播放器 之一。这款跨平台播放器功能丰富，可以播放任何可用的媒体格式。

你会惊讶地发现 VLC 不仅仅是一个视频播放器。它可以对你的媒体文件做很多事情。

我们分享过 使用 VLC 下载 YouTube 视频 的 VLC 技巧。

让我再和你分享一个。用 VLC 裁剪视频怎么样？这不是 裁剪视频 的最佳方式，但它可以作为一个选择使用。

使用 VLC 裁剪视频

在 VLC 中裁剪视频本质上意味着从所需部分的开头到结尾录制视频。默认情况下，录制控制工具通常在 VLC 面板中不可见。

让我详细介绍一下步骤。

步骤 1：启用高级控件

要获取控件，你需要使其在主控制面板上可见。

首先选择“视图View”选项，然后选中“高级控件Advanced Controls”复选框。现在，如截图所示，出现了带有几个按钮的新控件行。



步骤 2：打开视频

为了裁剪视频，你需要在 VLC 中打开它。你可以通过“媒体Media &gt; 打开文件Open File”在 VLC 播放器中打开视频：



或者你可以使用 Nautilus 文件管理器中的 VLC 打开视频文件：



步骤 3：使用 VLC 的录制功能裁剪视频

打开视频文件后，将时间线设置为所需输出的起点并暂停视频。之后，按“录制”按钮并播放视频。



当达到所需输出的终点时，暂停视频并再次按下“录制”按钮停止录制。



这应该将裁剪后的输出保存到你的 ~/Videos 目录中。



故障排除：无法识别的输出文件

VLC 以 .ts 文件格式录制视频。这在 VLC 中受支持，你可以根据需要使用它。但是 Ubuntu 中的许多其他播放器，包括本地视频播放器，都无法识别该格式。因此，在这种情况下，有两种解决方案。

Gnome-Video 提示安装 GStreamer 包

当你尝试打开文件时，GNOME-Videos 会提示错误并建议安装 Gstreamer 多媒体编解码器。



你可以点击上图所示的 “在 Ubuntu 软件应用中查找Find in Ubuntu Software” 按钮，这将打开 Ubuntu 软件中心。你可以在那里安装所需的编解码器包。



同样安装 Gnome-videos 并使用它打开视频将解决问题。

使用 VLC 转换视频文件

如果你不想为此安装任何额外的软件包，你可以使用 VLC 本身将 .ts 文件转换为 mp4 格式以在任何其他播放器中播放。

为此，打开 VLC 并在“媒体Media”菜单下选择“转换/保存Conver/Save”选项。



现在，使用“添加Add”按钮提供需要转换的文件的位置，然后选择“转换/保存Conver/Save”，如截图所示。



选择所需的输出配置（MP4）并为输出设置文件名，然后按“开始Start”。



这将开始转换，并根据源的时长决定转换时间。完成后，你可以从 ~/Videos 目录访问转换后的输出。



总结

虽然确实可以使用 VLC 播放器来裁剪视频，但整个过程与专门的 视频编辑器 完全不同。

最大的问题是你需要观看所有裁剪部分才能完成裁剪，如果你要裁剪跨越数分钟的视频的一大部分，这就不方便了。

无论如何，这个很酷的功能在某些情况下可能是一个方便的工具，比如你想要的只是裁剪一个特定的小剪辑或从电影场景中制作一个 Gif。

                              <span>在这篇文章中，我们会介绍迄今为止所有 Ubuntu 发行版本的吉祥物。


你可能已经注意到了：每个 Ubuntu 版本都会有一个版本名称和代号。代号由两个单词组成，这两个单词有相同的首字母，第一个单词是形容词，另一个单词通常是一个濒危的物种名称。

对应于其代号，这些 Ubuntu 版本也有一个吉祥物。例如，Ubuntu 22.04 的代号为 “Jammy Jellyfish”，因此 Ubuntu 22.04 的桌面壁纸上有 吉祥物：水母 的图像。

但是实际上，这些“吉祥物”并不总是 Ubuntu 版本的一部分，因为吉祥物在早期的 Ubuntu 版本中是没有的。

有史以来第一个 Ubuntu 版本是在 2004 年 10 月发布的 4.10 版（LCTT 译注：Ubuntu 的版本号是由年份和月份的组合来表示的。）但是，直到 Ubuntu 8.04 LTS “Hardy Heron” 版本，你才会看到相关的吉祥物。

在我之前写的 另一篇文章 中，我整理了所有 Ubuntu 版本的默认壁纸。在本文中，你将了解到所有 Ubuntu 版本的吉祥物。

现在，就让我们按时间倒序，一起进入 Ubuntu 的吉祥物之旅吧。

（LCTT 校注：本文原文发表时，Ubuntu 22.10 尚未发布，它的代号是 “Kinetic Kudu”，吉祥物是“捻角羚”。）

（LCTT 校注：由于 Ubuntu 系列的代号和吉祥物选择的都是比较少见的动物和晦涩的描述，因此尽管译者和校对虽然尽力了，但是应该还有谬误。我觉得原文作者为了找出这些说明也尽力，恐怕真正权威的诠释只有 Canonical 才能给出吧。）

Like many people, I find social media somewhat exciting and also...a bit much. Sometimes you get deep-fried in algorithms, tracking data, and ads catered especially for you. You lack administrative control over what you want to see, especially on the old platforms many of us are used to. As usual, you must look to open source to fix the problem. And that&#x27;s exactly what Mastodon, an open source microblogging community, does.
With Mastodon social, not only are you working with open source software, but everything is decentralized, which means you can pick what you want to see partly based on the instance you want to occupy. Mastodon uses separate instances, each with its own code of conduct, privacy o…</span>

I spend a lot of time playing (I mean working) on my computers, and I&#x27;ve found a lot of interesting things. One that has most recently come to my attention is the zram0 device. I first noticed it when working on one of my Opensource.com articles several months ago. It showed up in the output from the lsblk command:
# lsblk

8:1    0   600M  0 part
[...]
252:0    0     8G  0 disk [SWAP]

It&#x27;s identified as swap space, which is what first piqued my curiosity, so I did some exploration.

But Why?

                              <span>http://routine.co), a modern calendar app for professionals.

In order to build Routine, we have interviewed hundreds of entrepreneurs and analyzed the behavior of thousand other. We have finally decided to share what we have learned in the form of an ebook.

The book summarizes the methodologies, tactics and tricks experienced entrepreneurs have learned to put in place over the years so that you do not have to go through that painful learning 🙂.

Unlike many productivity books that often feel abstract (and long!), this book has been written to follow a simple and very practical structure.

Every chapter goes through:

1. A problem you encounter on a daily basis as a busy person
2. An explanation of how the most organized people deal with such a situation
3. A list of tactics and tools that you can use to improve your productivity

Hope you will learn a thing or two.

Take care.

                              <span>@simplifybot to explain complicated tweets to us like we’re 5 using GPT3. 

We thought it would be a fun, free way for people to engage with different types of tweets and learn new things.

So far we have seen people use it to better understand crypto news, policy updates, philosophical takes and so much more!

We built a more extensive version of this in the form of a chrome extension and web app (you can learn more about this on our website - https://explainjargon.com/) which has higher quality translations, character limits, unlimited refreshing, and much more (coming soon!)

We would love to get your feedback on this bot!

                              <span>It&#x27;s no secret this has been a difficult year for many companies in tech. The truth is, it&#x27;s easy to be a leader when times are good. It&#x27;s less easy in the midst of a storm.
That&#x27;s why we assembled a panel of some of the smartest engineering leaders we know at Interact to talk about the leadership principles that help guide an engineering organization no matter what is happening in the world.
Today&#x27;s episode of Dev Interrupted features Michael Stahnke, VP of Platform at CircleCI; Lewis Tuff, VP of Engineering at Blockchain.com; and Carolyn Vo, Partner &amp; Head of Engineering at Oliver Wyman. 





  
  
  Episode Highlights Include:



(2:16) The current economic climate
(8:50) Engineers complaining about too many meetings
(14:36) Maintaining morale
(22:43) Building a culture that&#x27;s actually fun
(27:40) The importance of experimentation
(34:36) Owning your own message
(41:44) Seeking out mentors
(44:13) Acquiring new top talent
(51:00) Is now a time to be more or less aggressive when hiring?

                              <span>这个由 KDE 开发的功能丰富的文本编辑器正在变得更好和更有用！




Kate 文本编辑器 是一个不断发展和强大的开源文本编辑器，它可以作为微软的 Visual Studio Code 应用程序的替代品。

它可以在 Linux、Windows 和 macOS 上使用。

这个代码编辑器在 2021 年进行了重大升级，这可能使它成为了 KDE 对微软产品的回应。

在即将到来的 Kate 和 KWrite 22.12 版本上，他们的目标是添加许多非常有用的功能。

来简单看看我们可以从 Kate 中期待什么。

🆕 Kate Editor 的新增功能

如果你读了 Nate 的博客 了解 KDE 的改进，你可能已经知道了 KDE Plasma 和应用程序即将获得的升级。

但是，我想强调一些 Kate 22.12 将会带来的令人激动的新功能：


对 Qt 部件的支持

更新的欢迎页面

Git 差异查看器

配置标签页

剪切板历史


欢迎页面



和许多其他 KDE 应用程序 一样，Kate 现在将显示一个欢迎页面，该页面将欢迎用户并显示创建或打开文件、启动新会话、查看最近的文档等选项。

对于不喜欢这个页面的用户，欢迎页面上将提供一个选项，以在新窗口上禁用欢迎页面。

Git 差异查看器



Kate 终于增加了对显示 git-diff 的支持；用户将能够比较他们的代码以检查差异，并找到那些令人讨厌的、会导致他们的应用程序无法正常运行错误。

用户也可以从多种视图中进行选择，例如统一视图、并排视图和原始视图。

新的剪贴板历史粘贴对话框



Kate 现在添加了一个新的对话框，在粘贴的时候显示用户剪贴板内容的列表。

当你在多行代码之间切换，而又不想丢失重要的内容时，这可能会很有用。

配置标签页



Kate 也将添加一个配置标签页，让用户可以更改重要的设置，并添加了一个搜索栏，使用户可以快速查找特定的设置。

🛠️ 其他变更和改进

Kate 22.12 将带来的其他值得注意的改进包括：


优化的状态栏

对构建插件的改进

可移动的侧边栏按钮

对窗口处理的改进


Kate 正在成为微软的 Visual Studio Code 的合适替代品，并且自 2021 年大规模重构以来已经取得了很大的进步。

在 Kate 的 官方博客文章 中，你可以了解更多关于这些变化的信息，并看看它们实际是怎么工作的。

💬 你期待 Kate 22.12 的发布吗？还是更喜欢 VS Code？

罗马法院要求 Cloudflare 的 DNS 封锁 BT 网站

罗马法院已经确认，Cloudflare 必须通过其公共的 1.1.1.1 DNS 解析器阻止三个 BT 网站。Cloudflare 并不反对阻止针对其客户网站的请求，但认为干扰其 DNS 解析器是有问题的，因为这些措施不容易在地理上加以限制，将影响封锁该政府管辖范围以外的终端用户。

                              <span>使用 Lua 配置持久化应用设置。


不是所有的应用都需要配置文件；对很多应用来说，在启动时变得焕然一新对它们更有利。例如，简单的工具就极少需要偏好项和设置在使用过程中保持稳定不变。然而，当你编写一个复杂的应用程序时，如果能让用户设置与应用的交互方式，以及应用与系统交互的方式会很不错。这就是配置文件用来做的事情。本文将讨论一些利用 Lua 进行持久化配置的方法。

选择一种格式

关于配置文件很重要的两点是一致性和可预见性。你不会希望为了保存用户偏好项，将信息转储到文件中，然后再花几天去编码实现“逆向工程”，处理最后出现在文件里的随机信息。

这里用一些常用的 配置文件格式。Lua 有一些库可以处理大多数常用的配置格式；在本文中，我会采用 INI 格式。

安装库

Lua 库的核心仓库是 Luarocks.org。你可以在这个网站搜索库，或者你可以安装并使用 luarocks 终端命令。

Linux 环境中，你可以从发行版的软件仓库中下载它，例如：

$ sudo dnf install luarocks


在 macOS 上，请使用 MacPorts 或者 Homebrew。在 Windows 上，请使用 Chocolatey。

luarocks 安装后，你可以使用 search 子命令来搜索一个恰当的库。如果你不知道库的名字，可以通过关键词来搜索这个库，例如 ini、xml或者json，这取决于你想要用这个库做什么。打个比方，你可以搜索inifile&#x60;， 这个库被我用来解析 INI 格式的文本文件。

$ luarocks search inifile

Social media is not always sociable, and sometimes we need a sufficient impetus to change what we do and what we read. I began using Twitter as a replacement for my RSS reader in 2008, which revolutionized how I read and learned up to that point. Tweets from educators and free and open source (FOSS) advocates worldwide kept me informed and engaged in a learning network that was without equal. That&#x27;s changed over the past half dozen years, and recently a change in ownership and the shaping of what I read was driven more by an algorithm than by my personal interests and choices. During a yearly meetup of correspondents and editors of Opensource.com a few years ago, Seth Kenlon suggested giving Ma…</span>

Thanks to the ShardingSphere community&#x27;s continuous review and feedback to develop features such as data sharding and read/write splitting, our team found that some users create many shards when using the data sharding feature.
In such cases, there can be 1,000 physical tables corresponding to a sharding logical table, which disturbs users.
For instance, a SELECT * FROM t_order statement will lead to a full-route, which is obviously not the case for OLTP. This SQL can be placed in another Proxy to avoid blocking other requests.
However, if users are not familiar with Proxy or how to write a where condition and don&#x27;t know that sharding is not supported in this condition, a full-route is still r…</span>

你是否正在寻找一种将文件从 Windows 计算机快速传输到 Linux 计算机并再次传输回来的方法？开源的 PSCP 程序可以轻松传输文件和文件夹，当然它是开源的。

在 Windows 中设置 PATH

了解如何在 Windows 中设置命令路径可以更轻松地使用 PSCP 等方便的程序。如果你不熟悉该过程，请阅读 如何在 Windows 上设置 PATH。

使用 PSCP

PSCP（PuTTY 安全复制协议）是一个命令行工具，用于将文件和文件夹从 Windows 计算机传输到 Linux 计算机。


从 网站 下载 pscp.exe。

将 pscp.exe 移动到 PATH 中的文件夹（例如，如果你按照 Opensource.com 上的 PATH 教程进行操作，则为 Desktop\App）。如果你没有设置 PATH 变量，你也可以将 pscp.exe 移动到保存要传输的文件的文件夹中。

使用 Windows 任务栏中的搜索栏在 Windows 计算机上打开 Powershell（在搜索栏中输入 powershell。）

输入 pscp -version 以确认你的计算机可以找到该命令。


IP 地址

在进行传输之前，你必须知道目标计算机的 IP 地址或完全限定域名。假设它是同一网络上的计算机，并且你没有运行 DNS 服务器来解析计算机名称，你可以在 Linux 机器上使用 ip 命令找到目标 IP 地址：

[linux]$ ip addr show |grep &#x27;inet &#x27;

能打败顶尖的围棋 AI 却会输给业余选手

自从 AlphaGo 使用神经网络而通过自我对弈精通围棋后，人类就一败涂地了。研究人员创建了一个对抗性的围棋程序，使用一些超乎常规的下法训练，它在与业余棋手的对弈中败北，但是却可以打败一个顶尖的开源围棋 AI KataGo。KataGo 使用数百万次自我对弈学习围棋，但这仍然不足以覆盖所有可能的情况，留下了可利用的漏洞。研究显示，达到人类水平的 AI 往往会犯一些非常奇怪的错误，以让人类感到惊讶的方式失败。

Linux 内核中出现一个丑陋的“黑科技”

安全研究人员在 Linux 主线内核中发现了一个已经存在三年的“黑科技”：Linux 内核会识别以 “X” 字母开始的进程，并返回“不支持原子模式设置”的错误。这个丑陋的“黑科技”是为了解决旧版本的 X.Org 服务器中的一个错误。但由于没有人愿意再维护 X11，于是这个补丁的提交者觉得，与其修复有问题的代码，不如调整内核以绕开。但事实上这只是检查第一个字母是否是 “X”，扩大了打击面，因为不是所有以 “X” 开头的进程都是 X.Org 的进程。

                              <span>awk 和 Groovy 相辅相成，可以创建强大、有用的脚本。


最近我写了一个使用 Groovy 脚本来清理我的音乐文件中的标签的系列。我开发了一个 框架，可以识别我的音乐目录的结构，并使用它来遍历音乐文件。在该系列的最后一篇文章中，我从框架中分离出一个实用类，我的脚本可以用它来处理文件。

这个独立的框架让我想起了很多 awk 的工作方式。对于那些不熟悉 awk 的人来说，你学习下这本电子书：


《awk 实用指南》


我从 1984 年开始大量使用 awk，当时我们的小公司买了第一台“真正的”计算机，它运行的是 System V Unix。对我来说，awk 是非常完美的：它有关联内存associative memory——将数组视为由字符串而不是数字来索引的。它内置了正则表达式，似乎专为处理数据而生，尤其是在处理数据列时，而且结构紧凑，易于学习。最后，它非常适合在 Unix 工作流使用，从标准输入或文件中读取数据并写入到输出，数据不需要经过其他的转换就出现在了输入流中。

说 awk 是我日常计算工具箱中的一个重要部分一点也不为过。然而，在我使用 awk 的过程中，有几件事让我感到不满意。

可能主要的问题是 awk 善于处理以分隔字段呈现的数据，但很奇怪它不善于处理 CSV 文件，因为 CSV 文件的字段被引号包围时可以嵌入逗号分隔符。另外，自 awk 发明以来，正则表达式已经有了很大的发展，我们需要记住两套正则表达式的语法规则，而这并不利于编写无 bug 的代码。一套这样的规则已经很糟糕了。

由于 awk 是一门简洁的语言，因此它缺少很多我认为有用的东西，比如更丰富的基础类型、结构体、switch 语句等等。

相比之下，Groovy 拥有这些能力：可以使用 OpenCSV 库，它很擅长处理 CSV 文件、Java 正则表达式和强大的…</span>

                              <span>打算为你的项目开发工作安装 Python 3.11？下面是如何在 Ubuntu 等发行版中安装 Python 3.11 的方法。




Python 3.11 于 2022 年 10 月 25 日发布，并声称比之前的 Python 3.10 版本快 10% - 60%。

一如既往，3.11 中的功能和改进列表明显较多。下面是一个简介：


错误回溯更明确，可以指出导致错误的确切语句。

引入异常组和新的 except* 语法。

你可以在基础表达式中添加自定义文本，以便在你的代码中更好地处理错误。

引入 Variadic 泛型，允许在 Python 数值库（如 NumPy）中使用类似数组的结构。

字典类型 TypedDict 得到了改进，现在你可以指定个别字典项目是必须的还是可选的。

引入了 Self 注解，允许类返回它们自己的类型实例。


还有很多，你可以在官方的 3.11 亮点页面 上详细了解。

Linux 发行版中的当前 Python 版本

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 带有 Python 3.10，而最近发布的 Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu 也是同样的版本。然而， Kinetick Kudu 可能会在几周内采用 3.11。

另外，Fedora 37 已经有了 Python 3.11 RC2，并将提供该版本。

所以，如果你正在运行 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS、Linux Mint 21 或任何基于 Ubuntu-LTS 的发行版，这里是你如何通过 PPA 安装 Python 3.11 的方法。

注意：谨慎地使用这个方法。确保你知道你在做什么，因为替换 Linux 发行版的基础 Python 版本可能会导致系统不稳定。许多默认的应用程序和软件包都依赖于 3.10 版本。

                              <span>all designers have their own graphic assets and references that they store on the computer, on Pinterest, or elsewhere. So, anyway, they would have to jump between Pichon and Pinterest or local folders while working. Why not give them an opportunity to keep everything in one place?

That’s why we added a storage and trained AI to help you keep all your graphics in order. So, now you can;
• Upload your images to Pichon. The storage is unlimited.
• Organize your designs and references with folders and tags or rely on our AI that will identify the pics&#x27; content and tag them for you
• Search your designs right after importing. Pichon recognizes what&#x27;s pictured.
• Share images, folders, or the whole library via web links
• Find similar images in your library with AI help
• Erase backgrounds from images in one click with the built-in background remover
• Enhance low-quality images with the built-in image upscaler

And all that will be right next to 1.5M+ curated icons, illustrations, and photos for design and inspiration.

Pichon is like a treasure box, but with graphic assets that you can drag-and-drop into your favorite design apps and AI tools to work like a pro without distractions.

                              <span>我在 如何搭建知识库 中，将知识库的结构分为了「树状结构」和「网络结构」两种。
树状结构是自上而下的，网络结构是自下而上的。
但知识还有多少种结构呢？为什么是这两种？
知识本质上是信息的一种，想了解知识的结构，也可以类比信息的结构。一直以来我回答不好这个问题。
日复一日，在日常使用知识库和产品经理的工作中，无论是对知识库中的每一张知识卡片进行整理，还是在工作中经常需要查看数据库的数据结构，都将我指向一个词「信息架构」
于是，我想起了那本经典的的「北极熊」之书 —— 《信息架构 超越 Web 设计》
并且，我在这本三年前读过的书里，找到了现在的我想要的答案。

信息结构
在《信息架构》这本书中，将信息分为了以下三种结构
组织系统：组织结构可以分为互补的三种结构
层级结构
以数据库为导向的模式
超文本

信息结构会定义用户浏览的主要方式。适用于信息架构的主要组织结构包括层级结构 、以数据库为导向的模式和超文本，每种组织结构都有其优缺点。在某些情况下，只使用一 种是合理的。但在很多情况下，需要以互补的方式使用这 3 种组织 结构。 —— 《信息架构》第六章

看到这三个结构，我恍然大悟，觉得非常了不起。
简单的三种结构，几乎可以用来解释现在所有的笔记软件。
下面我将介绍每一种结构在知识库软件中的运用。结合我日常的使用经历，也给出一些建议。
（注：目前市面上可以作为知识库的软件有很多。我只选取我有使用过的软件作为本次功能的介绍。也就是 Notion、Obsidian、Logseq、wolai…）

信息结构会定义用户浏览的主要方式。适用于信息架构的主要组织结构包括层级结构 、以数据库为导向的模式和超文本， 每种组织结构都有其优缺点。

层级结构
层级结构，即是上一层级包括下一层级的结构。
层级结构的优势和劣势都很明显。优势是其层次清晰，劣势是维护成本高。
层级结构的广度和深度均不宜…</span>

又到双十一购物节，说来有趣，每年双十一我都会关注羽绒服这一品类，原因大概是冬天即将到来，我隐约有添购衣服的担忧，可又因为此时我还身穿短袖，买羽绒服有种错季购物的感觉，在将羽绒服加入购物车后往往又放弃下单。于是这些年，每到双十一，我的购物车里的羽绒服更新一次，羽绒服照片成了淘宝的皮肤挂件，年年换新。
我当然是有买羽绒服，但往往不是购物车里那件，我在淘宝上浏览的是万元左右的始祖鸟、Moncler、加拿大鹅，加入购物车里的是两千元左右的北面，但最终购买的是千元以内的波司登和优衣库轻薄款，哦对了，还有老家线下店铺的以纯羽绒服。
不过长期以往，我倒是对羽绒服有了足够多的了解，足以写下这篇有参考价值的文章，帮助人们选购羽绒服。
羽绒服的历史
人类自古以来就有利用动物皮毛御寒的历史，早在原始社会时期，人类祖先就已经初步掌握了将兽皮制作成衣物的方法，用兽皮和树叶蔽体防寒，后来逐渐出现麻、棉、丝等纺织物，人类衣物变得丰富。相对来说，人类利用禽类羽毛御寒的历史要短得多，在唐朝，人们用鹅绒和布混合填充在被子中，在十三四世纪的欧洲，人们用鸭和鹅的羽毛填充进被套中。
直到 1940 年，现代羽绒服才被发明出来，主角是美国的艾迪·鲍尔，作为一名狂热户外运动爱好者，他在一次户外钓鱼过程中差点冻死，于是决心制作一件真正保暖的外套。鲍尔找到了鹅毛的羽绒，又恰逢杜邦实验室在 1938 年发明了尼龙，尼龙织物质地紧密，与棉布相比，尼龙面料可以防止羽绒「钻绒」，于是，他将二者结合，把羽绒填充进尼龙面料的衣服，绗缝锁绒，并将第一件羽绒外套命名为「Skyliner」，申…</span>

Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are essential in structuring the modern team for success, and it is crucial to set high quality and meaningful OKRs to keep progress on the right track. In his book, John reveals how the goal-setting system of OKRs has helped tech giants from Intel to Google achieve explosive growth—and how it can help any organization thrive.

For many companies, especially smaller ones, a list of top priorities (Big Rocks) was enough to drive their planning process. But as teams grew, they naturally started forming a deeper list of commitments. In most cases, these had some relationship to the Big Rocks, but they were far more specific. Companies might only have 3-5 Big Rocks at a time, but have 100s of commitments. These commitments manifested in many ways — list of projects, spreadsheets of tasks, etc. But by far the most common framework we saw was the “OKR method.”

This Coda doc walks you through John’s OKR-setting system with the intention of integrating his best practices into your current planning processes. In this new version, we added high-level advice for teams, automatic reminders for stakeholders, and table columns to better organize your OKRs.

We’re happy to hear feedback on the template or just chat more about OKRs in general. Let us know what you think in the comments—and happy planning.

Having just switched work laptops last December, I realized how much I love applying stickers to my work machines. Sometimes the stickers are souvenirs from past events, others are from projects that I am passionate about, and some are just for fun!
Curious to know what others had on their laptops, I asked!

Here is my work laptop (Can you tell my roots are in Drupal). My favorite decal is the Druplicon with the wheelchair... When Drupal 8 came out, we took the logo and blended it with the wheelchair because the agency I worked with focused on accessibility.

前言
毋庸置疑，如今的 Chrome 及其他基于 Chromium 的 Blink 内核浏览器因其速度快、网页兼容性好的优点，以绝对的优势占据了浏览器市场的主导地位。但与此同时，因为 Chrome 与 Chromium 被一家号称「不作恶」但处处作恶的公司所拥有，所以经常被诟病存在隐私问题。许多想要逃离 Chrome 统治的人都转向了更加自由的 Firefox 浏览器，尽管其母公司 Mozilla 近年来也是骚操作不断，但 Firefox 仍然是除 Chromium 的 Blink 和 Safari 的 WebKit 外唯一选择。
我曾经也很喜欢用 Chrome（或者说是 Chromium），使用 ArchLinux 作为主力系统的我，官方软件源中使用开源 Chromium 代码编译出的 Chromium 浏览器在当时体验基本与谷歌官方的闭源 Chrome 一致。促使我转向使用 Firefox 的契机开始于一年多前，谷歌限制了第三方浏览器对其数据同步 API 的使用，这样一来各家发行版自行编译的 Chromium 浏览器都失去了账户同步功能，这在当时引起了很多不满。从那时开始，我就开始尝试使用 Firefox 替代 Chromium 作为我的主力浏览器，并最终彻底淘汰掉了 Chromium。
无独有偶，谷歌又宣布将会在 2022 年底彻底禁用 Manifest V2 规范（后来又推迟了半年），作为替代者的 Manifest V3 规范，用谷歌的话说是为了「保护用户隐私」，限制了浏览器扩展的很多权限，其中影响最大的是禁用了 We…</span>

                              <span>本次更新：
前几天看了「赛博朋克：边缘行者」，觉得里面的拖影效果非常有趣，就在 app 里做了一下。

App 介绍：
CUBE 是一款结合 iOS 软硬件新特性来完成实时特效的 app ，希望大家在手机上就可以玩到有趣的特效。 以我看过的热门影音作品为灵感，已经完成下面三个主要特效：
LiDAR 扫描效果：
日本女团 Perfume 在 Flow 的 MV 中大量使用点云这种技术，而正好配备 LiDAR 的 iPhone 可以感知深度，生成点云。
 
采样实时图像与 LiDAR 扫描仪生成的深度图，生成 3D 粒子（点云）。至多可生成 3,000,000 个粒子。
将生成的 3D 粒子与现实世界的场景混合在一起，让你感觉身处超现实世界。

Matrix 效果：
之前 黑客帝国 4 上映，黑客帝国又变成热门话题，就很想复刻一下经典的 code rain 。
 
这一次会选蓝色药丸还是红色药丸？

液态金属效果：
 
既然都提到了黑客帝国，那么终结者也不能不提。贯穿全系列的液态金属杀手也是经典之一。CUBE 带你回到 1991 年，化身成为詹姆斯·卡梅隆所拍摄的电影「终结者 2：审判日」中的终结者 T-1000 。

兑换码：
如果你对上面三个特效感兴趣，你可以在这里找到兑换码。
（我把码都放到一个 notion page 里，可以回复用掉的兑换码编号，方便我编辑。）

                              <span>如何让枯燥的读书像看剧、享受美食、打游戏一样快乐？
读书上瘾模型，让读书成为一个上瘾循环。

上学的时候我比较喜欢玩游戏，但是在图书馆有很好的学习看书的氛围，游戏玩得比较少。毕业后，不再有看书的氛围了，玩游戏的频率逐渐增加，从每周1天增加到2天、后来逐步增加到7天，每天都玩游戏。
那个时候我意识到已经游戏上瘾了，打游戏占据了太多的时间，所以决定戒掉游戏，经过几次尝试，终于在2020年把游戏戒掉了。

即从游戏上瘾转变为读书上瘾，读书包括输入和输出两个步骤。输入指的是看书，从去年开始在豆瓣记录读书情况，利用周末和工作日的被动等待时间，每个月最多读过11本书。
输出分为写、说、实践3种形式。

写，发表长篇博客或简短的书评。
说，分为线上和线下两种形式，线上指在各个自媒体平台发布读书视频；线下指面对面形式，1对1的交流沟通或1对多的分享。
实践，看书不应该只停留在改变认知的程度，还要实践、改变自己的行为习惯。比如看了一本关于运动的书，不仅要有每天都运动的认知，还要付诸于每天的实践行动。

上一次玩游戏是在2020年，接下来详细介绍如何从游戏上瘾转变为读书上瘾。

PBTFANS KABUKI-CHO 歌舞伎町
2022.4 
IC Base
这套键帽是由设计师OAY （罗马音？大概能翻译成哦呀，语气词）设计的第二套键帽，此前他还设计过pbtfans的深海来客，感兴趣的可以看我之前盘点的蓝色系键帽。
这套歌舞伎町键帽，灵感来源于日本的歌舞伎町——东京的娱乐中心之一。电影院、电玩舞厅、酒吧等等，从深夜到黎明，也是为数不多的大型红灯区，我对于歌舞伎町最深刻的印象则是来自于《银魂》中主角团所居住的歌舞伎町一条街。
配色：

这次的配色非常丰富，主要还是由于个性部分选用多种不同色彩。键帽整体底色以深蓝暗色调为主，而字符和个性选用明亮的色调，如同霓虹灯招牌的颜色，侧面烘托出歌舞伎町“不眠之街”的名号，到深夜依然灯火通明、灯红酒绿。
个性部分：
大货版本
这次的现货销售是直接将个性和base进行了捆绑，还包含了四个颜色的盖帽。
个性部分主要由歌舞伎、酒精和没事组成，以及歌舞伎町的招牌和著名的“一丁目”。颜色上也是选择非常丰富，盖帽倒是提供了一种略微复古但俏皮的感觉，七字回车则是意味着现代的电力为这般灯红酒绿提供了便利。
搭配展示：
该键帽已经开售有一段时间，所以已经有玩家提供了实拍的照片，有这些实物图，能更好的帮助我们来判断是否购入。

键帽信息：
材质：PBT材质
高度：原厂高度
工艺：二色工艺
厂商：PBTFANS
淘宝有售卖，据悉歌舞伎町卖的很好，货量有限，kbd自己的店铺已经卖完了，经销商仍有现货。 
个人评分:7-8（深色键帽非常耐看，歌舞伎町的主题也很新鲜，个性颜色丰富,PBTFANS代工水平不错）
购买建议：喜欢这个主题的值得入手，现货也无需等待

                              <span>前言
仔细翻了翻我个人的钢笔产品分享，和大家讨论过的都是以著名品牌的钢笔产品为主，对于国内钢笔品牌主要还是分享英雄旗下的经典产品与创新之作，毕竟其它钢笔品牌以我个人的眼光去看，都是没有太多购买意义的产品。
对于钢笔入门我始终推荐白金preppy系列、白金小流星系列、百乐78g、凌美狩猎者这些海外品牌的平价款式。
但因为英雄的关系，国人对于暗尖结构的钢笔有着相当的偏好，并且海外知名品牌如今也没有任何纯粹的现产暗尖钢笔产品。所以如今暗尖钢笔的赛道上全是国产钢笔品牌，并且价位主战场就是十元上下的低端市场，本篇中，我在某多多以零售价格，购买了十余款销量出色的国产暗尖，文内将从暗尖钢笔的用料、设计、特点来对它们进行全面的横评对比，希望能为大家了解这些产品带来帮助。
暗尖钢笔的发源与如今价位分布

暗尖钢笔发源于人类历史上最为成功的钢笔派克51，其诞生于1939年，暨派克成立51周年，故因此得以型号命名。
派克51的暗尖结构，通过树脂包裹了笔尖，在当年革新性得提高了钢笔的气密性，并根据结构，设计了新一代的毛细供墨系统，达到了更为稳定的书写效果。
在当年，暗尖钢笔以这两点综合的超强实用性，得到了市场的一致认可，直至停产派克51累计销售4000万支，是人类历史上最为成功的系列钢笔。
之所以停产，是因为后续钢笔的气密性与供墨毛细结构材料随着现代工业不断革新，暗尖已经不再具备核心优势。
现在的暗尖钢笔从高到底个人认为是三个层次，首先是派克前年复刻了51，做了个包住明尖的假暗尖，是目前价格最高的笔款，但不怎么值得去买。其次是英雄100代表了国产暗尖金笔，曾经100多元的价格性价比非常好，如今价格普遍要200以上，还是可以买，但没曾经的极致性价比了；最后就是本篇讲的10元上下，国产的钢尖暗尖钢笔！
暗尖钢笔的特点

一、暗尖钢笔因为笔尖露出部分少，书写时可以产生形变的笔尖体积相对较小，所以书写时感…</span>

Vely combines high performance and the low footprint of C with the ease of use and improved safety of languages like PHP. It&#x27;s free and open source software, licensed under GPLv3 and LGPL 3 for libraries, so you can even build commercial software with it.
Using Vely for SaaS
You can use Vely to create a multitenant web application that you can run on the Internet as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Each user has a completely separate data space from any other.
In this example web application, a user can sign up for a notebook service to create notes and then view and delete them. It demonstrates several technology integrations in just 310 lines of code across seven source files. The technologies incl…</span>

在 Android 手机的宣传稿中，我们经常能听到厂商宣传其所搭载的图像传感器型号，例如索尼 IMX***、三星 S5K***、豪威 OV**** 等。但在 iPhone 的宣传中，我们就不曾听过苹果声明 iPhone 使用的图像传感器型号，一般都是使用「传感器面积增大了百分之几」「像素更大更深」「全新的高速传感器」之类的比较模糊的用词，所以对于历代 iPhone 具体使用何种传感器，互联网上有诸多不能明确的信息。此文意在将我自己搜集到的相关信息进行梳理，试图考证它们的可靠性，为之后写作 iPhone 图像传感器进化打下基础。

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://sspai.com/post/76663">

                              <span>写在最前面，CFE卡贵谁都知道，但是这玩意性能是真的强，不管你现在用不用得着，都建议你收藏一下，虽然现在买不起，但是梦想还是要有的嘛！
CFE-A卡是索尼从A7S3开始使用的新一代高速存储设备，以应对越来越大的视频录制码率。早先使用CFE-A卡的机型都比较贵（A7S3,FX3,A1等），受众并不多。但从A7M4的大卖和FX30的发布，越来越多的用户开始使用支持CFE-A卡的相机，如何选购一张合适的CFE-A卡就成了许多用户头疼的问题。
懂数码的都知道，索尼虽然“爱好广泛”，但唯独没有生产研发存储产品的业务，也就是说索尼的卡都是其他厂家代工的贴牌产品，理论上是不可能干得过拥有独立生产研发存储颗粒的品牌的，所谓的索尼大法黑科技在存储领域也仅仅是索尼粉丝自己加上的滤镜而已。
由于CFE-A卡是索尼独占的新卡型，在发布之初的相当长一段时间里都只有索尼原厂的卡可以选择，因为缺少比较的竞品，让许多人养成了原厂&#x3D;最好的固有印象。
如今第三方的CFE-A品牌越来越多，索尼原厂卡到底是个什么水平，终于可以有一个正经的横向比较了。
市面上可以做CFE-A卡的品牌有索尼，雷克沙，天硕，和至誉科技四家，笔者手里正好分别有一张拿来比较测试，他们是

索尼原厂的80G，官方售价699;
分别是雷克沙的320G，官方售价5599带读卡器;
天硕的80G，官方售价399；
至誉科技的120G，官方售价1599;

少数派不让带货就不放链接了。

之所以价格区间跨度很大，从几百到几千，主要是为了照顾不同经济实力的用户。
测试采用的读卡器是雷克沙的RW530，是一个CFA和SD卡双卡槽的读卡器，采用USB 3.2gen2接口，两个卡槽可以同时工作，可以实现互拷的功能。

一、性能对比
1、索尼80G

首先出场的是原厂的80G，由于这张卡是在套机里一起售卖的，拆机卡很多，只要六七百。买的人很多，不过大多数都舍…</span>

                              <span>作为一名iPhone用户，快捷指令是系统中我觉得很有趣但实际上用得不是很多的应用。
最初对快捷指令的理解仅限于将多个操作步骤简化成一个，最直观的应用就是在功能日益繁杂的APP中实现功能的一键直达，比如疫情期间的健康码。
但深入探究一番后，我认为快捷指令的本质其实是打破各个APP沙盒的壁垒，实现不同应用程序的能力互通，提升个人的自动化水平。
但事情情况并不尽如人意，虽然快捷指令编辑器提供了足够强大的编辑器，但三方应用对其支持并不好，大多数APP还是尽可能期望把用户圈在自己的生态中，没有开放足够的能力出来，这也是一款生态级应用的无奈。
想象中的快捷指令
现在应用商店的APP已经足够多，可以帮助人们解决足够多的问题，但有时候一款应用并不能完全解决某项任务，需要多个应用配合操作，如果用户可以随意调用应用中功能并组合成自己所需要完成特定任务的能力，那么用户体验和效率都将提升到新的高度。
想象一种场景，当我在观看自己感兴趣的外语视频时，因为语言的障碍可能不能足够理解视频内容，我需要一些辅助支持：我希望翻译软件能够帮我把外语翻译成母语，甚至希望语音合成软件将翻译后的语言读出来。孤立地看这个场景中的每个需求，都有应用能很好得实现：视频网站能够提供我感兴趣的内容，翻译软件能将语言进行较高准确度的翻译，语音合成软件能够将文字朗读出来。但是当这三个需求点分布在三个不同的APP时，用户就难以较高效率完成这个场景的任务。实际上每个APP的能力都被封锁在了自己APP里面。

上面说的这个场景我自己就有，但是因为没能使用现有工具很好使用，只得自己动手做了一个插件，可以朗读B站上面带有字幕的视频，因为微软的中文语音合成做得比较好，所以先放在Edge浏览器上了，目前还只支持带外挂字幕的视频，大家感兴趣也可以使用。

现实中的快捷指令
虽然当前快捷指令还不够优秀，但对于日常效率的提升还是有一定帮助的，特别是对于实现与苹果自带应用的互通。
举个使用的例子，每天早上我会用笔记软件记录一下昨日回顾、思考以及今日的计划，对于今日计划，我希望用待办应用去跟踪计划中事项的状态，但是手动把写过的东西在另一个APP里面再写一遍实在是太过愚蠢，于是我就写了快捷指令去实现。

实际使用中，只要选择对应的文本并在共享表单中点击对应的操作就可以同步到系统自带的提醒事项中，在mac上还可以添加快捷键一键实现（应该还可以通过「自动化」省去手动操作这一步）。
当前的快捷指令有三个亮点：

在快捷指令的编辑上采用图形化拖拽操作，相对于写脚本，这种操作显得更加友好，并且也可以支持自定义脚本的加入，甚至让我一度觉得学编程的第一个应用是用快捷指令写得；
在快捷指令的运行上打通了Siri、小组件以及共享操作，特别是后者，为与三方应用的结合提供了基础的平台；
加入了自动化功能，可以根据一定的规则直接省去了用户主动调用快捷指令这一步。

但要让更多的人在更多场景下使用快捷指令，还有着一些明显的不足：

上手使用上有一些门槛，官方没有详细的教程，虽然提供了一些案例，但是大多数人应该没有耐心仔细去看快捷中心中那些精选的指令是如何实现的，这点Mac上快捷指令前辈「自动操作」可能给点其启示，其中「录制」功能可以通过「我做给你看」自动识别操作中的事件；
快捷指令的分发做得还不够，既然不是每个人都能轻松使用快捷指令，那么获取现成的快捷指令则更加重要，但快捷指令中心中精选的指令本土化、个性化做得并不好，我觉得如果能根据用户所安装的APP来个性化分发常用的快捷指令会更友好；
三方应用的能力开放明显不足，大多数的使用场景还是围绕在苹果自带应用提供的能力，这点极大限制了快捷指令的应用场景；
使用Siri来激活快捷指令时对于指令的识别非常差，官方有说使用快捷指令的名称就可以通过Siri调用，但实际使用时不时语音识别不出来就是调用的指令不正确；

有趣的是，在WWDC2022中，我们看到苹果开始推广App Intent框架，通过为应用开发者提供更多系统级的入口曝光来吸引他们将其应用所能满足的用户意图曝光给系统，从而使得系统可以通过学习用户行为实现跨应用的能力整合。
结语
很多人即使生活中充满重复的事情也不会去探索提高效率方式，因为对比眼前简单的操作，去探究增进效率操作的所花费的学习努力带来的成本更加高，只是把时间线拉得足够远，才能看见效率提升所带来收益。
自动化所存在的意义是帮助人完成任务并节省时间，虽然我们每个人都已经拥有足够多的计算设备，但我们并没有充分发挥其拥有的算力，个人的自动化仍是一个尚待开发的领域。
期待未来的快捷指令能为个人的自动化增添更多的可能性。</span>

                              <span>记账是我坚持得最久的习惯，到如今已经快4年。
期间有中断过，怀疑过，也尝试过很多不同的工具，发现用对工具的确轻松很多，也更容易坚持。今天就来跟大家分享下我记账这些年的心路历程，希望能帮到正在犹豫记账的你。
我会先讲下我是如何坚持记账，以及记账对我的改变，最后再分享记账应用（附带视频），只想看评测的话可以直接跳到最后哦。
一、如何开始记账
我之所以开始记账，也是因为发现自己每个月钱都不知花哪去了，所以想通过记账来了解自己的收支情况，让自己对生活掌控得更好。
一开始是消费一单就记一次，但太繁琐了，经常会忘记。所以就改成了每天固定睡前记账。但这样，依旧老是忘记，于是我设置了每晚10点的定时闹钟，效果就好很多了。等到养成习惯后，就再也不用设置闹钟了，以后一到那个点，脑子就自动提醒我记账，偶有遗忘，但也慢慢坚持下来了。而且因为我用打卡app，所以如果没记账，那天的记录就会为空，出于强迫症的原因，我也一定会把缺的那天补上。就这么不知不觉坚持了快4年。
但其实，我这种每一笔都记的方式还是比较费劲的，不一定适合所有人，我这里推荐两个降低难度的方式：

别全部都都记，这样太琐碎，而是设置一个额度，高于该额度的支出才记。
是充分利用记账应用，选择有自动同步账单功能，或者支持语音输入的记账应用，下面有推荐类似的App。

二、对记账的反思
那我这样记账4年下来的结果如何呢？
一方面，我的确因此免去了许多不必要的开支，存住了钱，对比起身边一些朋友，有储蓄更踏实，还可以把闲钱拿出来投资理财。
但另一方面，我也明显感觉自己似乎有点 落伍了......当同龄人在炫耀新买的电子产品、潮牌、口红包包时，当别人用钱堆出来一个时髦大方的形象时，其实很难不羡慕。可是让我去购买一些非必需品，这带来的罪恶感，又远大于我得到它的满足感。

是的，记账的习惯，让我的消费习惯变成了——只买有用的东西。

瑞典时间 10 月 4 日上午，诺贝尔奖委员会宣布 2022 年诺贝尔物理学奖授予阿兰·阿斯佩克特 (Alain Aspect)、约翰·克劳瑟 (John F. Clauser) 和安东·泽林格 (Anton Zeilinger)，以表彰他们 「进行了纠缠光子的实验，确立了对贝尔不等式的不成立并开创了量子信息科学」。阿兰·阿斯佩克特、约翰·克劳瑟和安东·泽林格分别利用处于相互纠缠的量子态进行了突破性的实验。在这种情况下，两个粒子即使被分开也表现得如同一个整体。他们的成果为基于量子信息的新技术扫清了道路。
—— 摘自诺贝尔物理学奖官方新闻稿

说实话，在诺贝尔奖委员会正式宣布量子纠缠相关的成果获奖后，我立刻就意识到，互联网上很快就会充斥着各种针对量子纠缠以及量子世界的神秘性相关的科普。这些科普，无论是原创的还是东拼西凑的，无论是专家学者起草的还是各路内容流水线上生产的，都有一个共同的特征：它们往往都喜欢强化量子物理的神秘性和不可理解。
我承认，历史上确实有这么一段时间，即使是 20 世纪初期那些鼎鼎大名的物理学家，都曾为量子相关的物理现象感到困惑。然而，经过一百多年的发展，量子物理的诸多核心概念早就被一代又一代的物理学家里里外外地玩了个遍，以至于许多被科普作家渲染得神乎其神的概念，现正躺在物理系本科生的必修课教材里。
当然，量子力学有它反直觉的地方。但是，现实生活中反直觉的事情还少吗？反直觉并不意味着神秘或不可理解。它只是需要你屏蔽你的许多生活常识，用绝对的理性来思考问题。所以，这篇文章会和你读过的绝大部分科普不同，我不会把量子…</span>

                              <span>引言：用惯旗舰的我，为啥突然自购了一台入门DAP？

我承认，这个标题有点蹭过时热搜的标题党嫌疑；但作为一个有着五六年HiFi设备购买经验、分享却极其佛系的用户，收获不能说是经验丰富吧，至少也能说是白忙一场；自从三年以前第一次入手了旗舰级的KANN CUBE之后，为了追求“好马配好鞍”，在便携领域各种入手搭配的旗舰耳塞线材套装，洒出去的钱也有个五位数往上了。虽然标题上写着是对节奏坦克新款播放器V6的体验，但从某种程度上来说，这篇文章也算是玩了这么久的HiFi设备之后，一篇简单的自我回顾和反思文章。
在半个月前，我绝对不可能相信听惯了“旗舰级DAP”的自己会甘于使用一台中低端价位的播放器，即便中低端播放器近年来也的确出现过不少声音表现优秀、拉动价位甚至行业疯狂内卷的机器，但高端播放器毕竟有自己的能力与气场：作为品牌的旗舰，一般都有着最好的用料、最新的功能配置、最前沿的DAC芯片——著名的Astell&amp;Kern甚至没事就和上游的旭化成深度合作，三代SP系列几乎成为AKM全新旗舰DAC的首发平台；同时也倾注着品牌最优秀的音乐理解。
很显然，这些资源优势都是一般中低端播放器很难获得的，所以我现在依旧不怀疑“正经厂牌的高端播放器在综合素质表现上必然优于中低端产品”；以上观点也不代表我认为“所有人都必须和我一样不买个几万块东西就别想快乐听歌”，如果你的天桥9.9耳机已经让你非常快乐，那太好了，什么设备都理应有快乐听歌的权利。我开始怀疑的是，每天没事盯着见底的工资卡、紧了吧唧的盘算着怎么搭配耳机播放器，导致我个人的生活多了一堆需要计较的大小事，这些真的能让我听歌的过程变得更“快乐”吗？

因此这半个月的时间刚好给了我一个机会，你也可以认为这种机会比较祸福相依：我自购的SP1000在半个月前，因为某些极其离谱的外部非质量原因，不慎导致2.5mm接口损坏，被迫返厂维修。设备虽然要修，歌却不能…</span>

                              <span>痛点
想想看，平时在阅读上，你做了多少无用功？
勤勤恳恳阅读，认认真真做好高亮批注。你看到自己的思考结果与文章或者书中的文字融于一体，觉得特别安心。
然而，当你需要整理或者调用这些笔记的时候，才发现它们如同断线的珠子，散落在各种地方：
RSS 阅读内容在 feedspot 里； 微信公众号的高亮在 Instapaper 里；Epub 标记在 Marginnote 里；PDF 的高亮和批注在 LiquidText 里面…… 如果不加整理，它们就会在不同的应用中终老。
问题来了，该怎么整理这些散落的阅读笔记？
有的人并不觉得这是个棘手的事情。他们的作息时间，如同钟表一般规律。可以做到每天晚上专门花时间，雷打不动把这些内容整理出来，做好分类，放在 Evernote 或者 Obsidian 里。
但是，这种方法，对于懒人显然不友好。至少我自己，就笃定无法日复一日坚持下去。即便我希望能持续一周这样操作，恐怕都得专门雇个人在旁边监督自己。
幸好，技术的进步使我们不用活得那么悲摧。有一些工具可以帮助我们汇集各种资料，尤其是帮你保管阅读记录和高亮、批注。更好的消息，是这些工具有很多，例如 Readwise, Matter, Diigo, Cubox 和简悦（Simpread）等。
本文我就以自己常用的 Readwise 为例，为你介绍如何自动化汇集整理和利用笔记。希望这些经验也能够帮到你，早日摆脱手动整理阅读笔记的困扰。
Readwise
我是 2020 年 4 月开始使用 Readwise 的。7 天试用期过后，我发邮件找 Readwise 官方申请了个教育优惠，就开始使用了。

Readwise 的特点，是支持非常广泛的信息输入来源，例如我这里已经连接的来源包括 Kindle, Instapaper, Medium, Airr, Twitter, Apple Books 等等。

                              <span>iA Writer 是一款非常著名的，以简洁优美的界面和不错的使用体验著称的 Markdown 写作软件（虽然我没用过）。而最近，iA Writer 的开发商 iA.net 发布了一款名为 iA Presenter 的幻灯片制作软件，旨在通过简单的 Markdown 创作出精美的幻灯片。
市面上制作幻灯片的软件已经是数不胜数，除了常见的 PowerPoint、Keynote，还有基于 HTML5 技术的 Prezi、reveal.js、Canva 等，基于文档生成幻灯片的软件也有不少，比如双链笔记软件 Obsidian、文档工具语雀、飞书文档、石墨文档都有演示模式。
在这么多软件之中，iA Presenter 又有哪些优势，值得我们从繁杂的工作中抬起头来呢。
首先说明一下，目前 iA Presenter 还处于一个非常早期的阶段，文中提到的一些内容随时可能会因为软件的版本更新而发生变更。
另外，下文中会将 iA Presenter 简称为 iA Pre。
在此，也感谢 @南山居氪 提供的 iA Presenter 的邀请码。
PowerPoint 发生了什么
似乎现在很多软件都在以一种革命性的姿态来发布——认为自己的诞生能够颠覆一个行业，至少在发布时会伴随着一些阐述自己设计哲学的文章。Roam 和 Arc 是如此，iA Pre 也有些这样的味道。
iA 在其新闻页面上发了两篇文章，主要在说 PowerPoint 等传统幻灯片工具有什么问题，和 iA Pre 怎样使幻灯片更好？。
在第一篇文章1中，iA 认为，以 PPT 为代表的传统幻灯片工具有着入门难、耗时长、会让演讲者忘记他想说的东西、以及搭配 PPT 的演讲大多很无聊，这种无聊是我们的职业杀手以及事业杀手。
iA 怎样使幻灯片更好？
而在第二篇文章2中，iA 提出了他们认为的让演讲和幻灯片制作变得更好的方法：

                              <span>很多人会把人生比喻为游戏，因为都需要在既定的规则下，和他人同台竞争谋求最大胜利，读书时的升学排名，就业后岗位的激烈竞争，无一不是要决出个胜负，每个人都要追求赢。
但我们可能从来没有想过，除了参加有输赢的游戏，其实我们还可以选择另一种游戏——没有输赢，可以持续玩下去的游戏。
这便是《有限与无限的游戏》中的观点，它认为世界上至少有有限和无限两种游戏，有限游戏以获胜为目的，无限游戏以延续游戏为目的。
很神奇的是，我之前从《游戏改变世界》这本书中首次知晓该理论时，只是觉得有意思，但对我并没什么启发。

可是真的当我自己看完这本20万字的小书后，对我的影响却是立竿见影的。我读完隔天，在工作上和同事发生冲突时，脑子里一直在想着“不行，我不能像对方一样发火，我要玩的是无限游戏，争一时的输赢的玩不下去了”，因此就忍住了火气，最终也顺利解决了问题。
所以呢今天也为大家推荐这本书，看完后你一定会觉得，哇，原来有些竞争是根本没必要投入的，原来选择还可以有这么多，生活的改变从心态的改变开始，相信你也可以和我一样豁然开朗！
不过该书其实是本哲学书，理解和解读起来有一定难度，而且写法更偏意识流，作者没有特意去构建严密的框架和推理，甚至全书中作者自己都没有直接发表过「无限游戏更好」的结论，所以我会加入个人的理解去解读以便更好地介绍，但我也只是抛砖引玉，建议大家过后去看全书。
一、有限与无限游戏的基本概念
有限游戏有三个显著特征。

它是以取胜为目的，一旦决出胜负则游戏结束，所以称之为有限游戏，注意这里的胜负必须是所有参与者认同，而不是裁判或观众认同。
参与者只能在游戏界限内进行游戏。
有限游戏的规则一经所有参与者认同就生效，且不能改变，否则就是另一个游戏了。

怎么样，听起来是不是很熟悉，几乎跟我们从小到大遇到的竞争一个模式。而无限游戏则恰好是跟它反着来的，它也有三个相对的显特征。

它并非以取胜为目的…</span>

上几篇专栏介绍了绿色系、蓝色系，自然少不了光学三原色的另一名成员——红色。这一期来讲讲红色系键帽，方便各位键友选购搭配自己的梦中情键。

GMK Red Samurai 红武士
R1 2018.2 R2 2020
BASE
这套键帽是由设计师Redsun（红太阳）设计而成，同时他也是GMK蓝武士的设计师，gmk四大武士中的两款由他设计。关于这套键帽的灵感来源有两个版本。
在R1的IC中。

作者表示灵感来自于火影忍者中宇智波斑的铠甲颜色

而在R2中

作者则表示灵感来源于井伊直政（日本历史角色）
关于作者灵感来源，我还是更加倾向于R1中的说法，而为何要改口，可能是为了规避版权问题，但我个人觉得，在红武士中其实并不能看出过多来自于漫画中的角色要素，并且忍者和武士也是两种职业，作者关于忍者和武士的定义，好像也并没有非常清晰。
配色：

暗黄、深红、灰黑，低调而不失深度的配色，黑红相间配以金色点缀，经典耐看。
个性部分：

这一套的个性数量和种类都非常丰富“忍”“侍”，其实这一套键帽虽然称之为武士，但里面也融合了非常多忍者的元素，在武器类型中“飞镰”、“团扇”、“手里剑”、“苦无”，都是非常常见的忍者标志性武器，还有一些不明所以的图案。
其实这位作者在R1中的早期个性设计，是带有浓烈火影忍者特色的。
早期个性设计
穿着盔甲的天狗，很显然是宇智波斑的须佐能乎，以及极其明显的神威万花筒写轮眼图案。
但在最终敲定版本中为了规避版权问题进行了大刀阔斧的修改，最终便呈现出一个极具忍者风味的武士主题键帽。

搭配建议：
深色无疑是合适的，这套键帽很是百搭，红色、蓝色、黄色，都能驾驭，我个人最喜欢灰色和黑色进行搭配，红色也是很不错的，但过于鲜亮的颜色搭配起来难度还是…</span>

                              <span>相信大部份人用的都是拼音輸入法。
學會一個非拼音的中文輸入法，是一件好玩的事，這是一項實用的技能，能證明你的智商和學習能力。
以後搞博客，工作，寫作，成為作家，跟人聊天，等等很多地方都能用上。
其實很多人對「形碼」還存在誤解。

誤解一，除了拼音就是五筆。
其實形碼是一衆不以拼音而是字形部件組合來輸入中文的方法。著名的有：倉頡、鄭碼、五筆，等等。
其中五筆是最有名，但又是最難學最難用的。
誤解二，形碼一定比拼音快。
其實形碼並不一定比拼音快，比如我用倉頡打「哈哈哈哈」，我輸入的是「romr romr romr romr 」，而拼音只需要輸入「hhhh 」。
也就是說，在某些特定場合，拼音，簡拼，比形碼還要快。
那形碼的優點是甚麼？形碼不是快，而是準。形碼人的思維是，如果連準確輸入都做不到，那快有甚麼用？
誤解三，五筆（形碼）很難，要背很多字根。
其實是因為五筆的字根太多太難背，才會給人這樣的感受。我用過五筆兩年，我也承認背字根是一個非常高的門檻。
但是，並不是所有形碼都跟五筆一樣難背。倉頡輸入法的字元就比五筆少很多，好記很多，記下根本不費吹灰之力。
誤解四，學個輸入法要浪費很多時間，學會了也沒甚麼用。
這是極其錯誤的想法。中文打字，不管到哪裏，都是實用的技能。現在網上到處都是同音錯字，比如「再在」不分，就是因為拼音輸入法根本打不準。那麼如果你跟別人文字聊天時，或者發表文章時，能做到用字準確，那不就是一個加分項嗎？
因此，花費一點時間，去學一個形碼，是事半功倍的事。一個好的中文輸入法，是可以用一輩子的。而你只需要用掉幾日的時間來學習。

先寫到這裏。我是中文輸入法專家尹卂，目前在用倉頡。有甚麼問題可以在下方留言。</span>

                              <span>前言
2022年10月24日，特斯拉官宣降价，基础版本model 3降价1.4万，model y降价2.8万，可以说是非常大的降价幅度，结合2022款整体上更新的车机芯片加上扩大的电池容量，一部分车款可以说是重回性价比车型的行列。
我们讲电车使用成本低，是基于有家用充电桩的环境，如果都用特斯拉超充，不算停车费，每公里电费都能到3毛以上，而使用谷时电家充，每公里电费可以控制在5分钱。但家充桩需要有固定车位，还要向电网申请电表，以及需要物业允许施工的证明，这些硬性条件也劝退着一些潜在车主。
而除了固定的家用充电桩，还有便携充电器，也就是随车充可以作为新能源车的补能方案。随车充在使用上可以使用家庭插座，支持自带线缆从家中接到室外充电，不需要独立电表，对于公司有插座、农村有自建房以及低楼层居民楼住户都比较友好。
本篇选择了四款随车充，覆盖了品牌、设计特点、功率支持的几个不同方向，来详细对比产品设计和具体功能，希望能为随车充的选择答疑解惑。
缆上控制与保护装置（IC-CDP)

其实随车充产品我分析过很多次，它本质上就是从电源到新能源车电机的连接装置，换言之就是一根电源线，电能转化为电池电量都是在新能源车内部完成的。而对于随车充产品消费首先需要重点关注的就是是否配备了缆上控制与保护装置，缩写为IC-CDP。
在国家标准GB/T 18487.1-2015《电动汽车传导充电系统 第一部分:通用要求》中，将就是一根电缆连接电动汽车和交流电网的随车充称为模式1产品；将电缆上加入IC-CDP的随车充产品称为模式2产品。前者可以为车充电，根据电缆长度不同售价在200元上下，但模式1产品缺乏保护功能和控制功能，便宜但抗风险能力基本为0。后者模式2则是大部分车主的核心选择，通过控制盒可以实现各种差异化功能，特斯拉、比亚迪的原厂随车充我们称为车规产品，都是模式2随车充。
对于我们私家车主而言，充电安全…</span>
