                              <span>Dart is an open-source, class-based, statically(&amp; strongly)-typed (with inference) programming language for building web and mobile applications created by Google. Although Dart is statically-typed it supports dynamic-typing through the &#x27;dynamic&#x27; type.
Dart’s design goals are:
Create a structured yet flexible language.
Make Dart feel familiar and natural to programmers and thus easy to learn.
Ensure that Dart delivers high performance on modern web browsers, mobile, and environments ranging from small handheld devices to server-side execution.
Dart targets a wide range of development scenarios, from a one-person project without much structure to a large-scale project needing formal types in the code to state programmer intent.




To support this wide range of projects, Dart provides the following features and tools:
Sound type system: A type system which feels lightweight thanks to inference and gives good safety
Mobile and Web frameworks: Dart developers can use Flutter on mobile and AngularDart on the web
IDE Integration: official plugins for Jetbrains&#x27; IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA / WebStorm etc) and Visual Studio Code. Community plugins also exist for many other editors backed by the Dart Analysis Server

                              <span>Abstract Data Type nima?


Ds&#x27;larni ko&#x27;rib/ tekshirib chiqishning 2 usuli mavjud:
Mathematical/Logical/Abstract Views.
Implementation.
ADTlar ma&#x27;lumotlar va operatsiyalarning ta&#x27;riflari bo&#x27;lgan, ammo ishga tushirish mumkin bo&#x27;lmagan ob&#x27;ektlardir.
ADTs are entities that are definitio of data and operations but don&#x27;t have implementation details.
Ya&#x27;ni biz qanday ma&#x27;lumot saqlayotganimizni va bu ma&#x27;lumotlar bilan qanday amallar bajarishimiz mumkinligini bilamiz ammo bu bu data strukturalarni hali ishga tushirmadik.
Har bir dasturlash tilining data strukturalarning ishga tushirilish usullari/yo&#x27;llari mavjud. Misol uchun biror DS C dasturlash tilida struct orqali ishga tushirilsa boshqa dasturlash tili (Java, C#) da ayni shu DS object orqali ishga tushirilishi mumkin.

Agar ushbu misolda boshqa dasturlash tilida yozilgan bo&#x27;lganda, faqatgina implementation view o&#x27;zgarar edi holos, Abstract/logical view o&#x27;zgarmayid. Bundan kelib chiqadiki, dasturlash tiliga qarab implementation har xil bo&#x27;lishi mumkin.

Abstract data type bu qanday ma&#x27;lumotni qay tarzda salash va keyinchalik unga qanday qilib murojaat qilish mumkinligi haqida umumiy tushuncha berish.</span>

One of the buttons in Material Design in Flutter web is called Elevated Button has the feature of rising in elevation as the user presses it. Use the ElevatedButton widget in Flutter if you need to construct a Material Design elevated button.
When tapped by the user, these buttons’ primary feature is a small elevation of their surface toward the screen. Simply put, elevated buttons are raised, non-deprecated buttons without a clearly defined button style.

That&#x27;s why at KuFlow we support different ways to implement the logic of our processes and tasks. And in this post, we will talk about one of them, the orchestration through Temporal, which gives us a powerful way to manage our workflows.
We will not go into detail on the concepts that are handled in our platform, for that you can consult the documentation or other blog entries, but as a general idea, we can stay with the following. KuFlow is a platform that allows you to model business processes that involve a series of tasks to carry out their achievement. These tasks can be performed by humans or by systems and are basically activities to perform actions and/or collect information. We also need to establis…</span>

Aegis Studio founder. Although the meeting should only last for 15 minutes we extend the discussion to 40 minutes. Our discussions were so intense and full of blockchains and its libraries, projects, NFTs, tokens, future and so on. The founder was very kind and he takes his time to explain me his company’s work and projects and how did the company make the money. They are literally working on very cool, big and tough projects from unicorn companies like apple, consensus. They have already developed multiple smart contracts, APIs for NFTs and currently working on all the latest tech stacks in web3 and web3 domains.

                              <span>A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.

The function adder returns another function when invoked, the lexical scope includes the sum variable which is accessible by the returned function. Note that in Go, a closure is always an anonymous function.
func adder() func(int) int {
   sum :&#x3D; 0
  // this is a closure, it has access to sum variable
  // each closure has its own sum variable
    return func(x int) int {
        sum +&#x3D; x
        return sum
    }
}


every time adder is invoked, it creates a new function with closure.
  addFn :&#x3D; adder()
  fmt.Println(addFn(1)) // initial sum value of 0 is added to 1  
  fmt.Println(addFn(2)) // returns 3, sum variable is maintained by addFn closure
  // calling adder like below will not work as intended as the closure from first line is not being used by the second line, instead, creating a new one
  fmt.Println(adder()(1)) // returns 1
  fmt.Println(adder()(100)) // returns 100

Another example of closure below where the closure is assigned to a variable first
func namer() func() string {
    name :&#x3D; &quot;my name&quot;
  // name variable still exists in fn even after namer is finished
    fn :&#x3D; func() string {
        return name
    }
  return fn
}

GitHub account
Project created in react js
Node installed
Code Editor [VS Code preferred]
First of all, install node in your system.


Navigate to your project root directory &amp; open that in VS Code. First check whether node is installed in your system or not. Open New Terminal &amp; put the command npm --version.




Install the gh-pages npm package using following command - npm install gh-pages --save-dev




Now, login to your GitHub account &amp; create a new repo with any name. I&#x27;m using demo-react-host for mine.

Navigate to VS Code now &amp; open package.json file to edit the homepage property. The homepage&#x27;s value should be in the format https://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}




Add deployement scripts to the same file.

DS - bu computer science sohasining eng muhim subjectlaridan biri bo&#x27;lib, agar siz kuchli software va dasturlash yaratishni hohlasangiz bu subjectni bilishingiz zarur bo&#x27;ladi.
Dasturlashda DS bu ma&#x27;lumotni foydalanishga qulay usulda yaratish, boshqarish va saqlashdir.
Oddiy qilib aytganda DS - ma&#x27;lumotlarni qay tarzda kumpyuterimizga saqlashimizdir.
Data Sftructuralar bu data type(int, char, etc.) lar emas, phyisical entitylar emas, ular shunchaki spesifikatsiyalardir ya&#x27;ni biz kompyuterimizdagi ma&#x27;lumotlarni oson ishlata olishimiz uchun joriy etgan qoidalar to&#x27;plami.
har bir ds(data struktura) ma&#x27;lumotni maxsus holatda saqlanishi uchun hizmat qiladi.
har bir maxsus ds faqatgina ma&#x27;lum bir muammolar uchun yaratiladi.
DS judayam ko&#x27;p ma&#x27;lumotlar bilan imkonini beradi, misol uchun juda katta database(malumotlar bazasi) yoki hash table.

Lug&#x27;atni real-world na&#x27;muna qilib oladigan bo&#x27;lsak, har bir harf uchun so&#x27;zlar ajratib qo&#x27;yilgan.

1962 年夏天，美国宇航局启动了水手 1 号任务，这是一项无人驾驶的任务，该机构将飞过金星并探测数据。当时的工程师通常在纸上写出他们的代码。然后这些代码通过一个复杂的系统被翻译成计算机可读的卡片，然后通过计算机执行该程序。这种手工使得意外错误率变得很高。缺失的符号与字符最终导致了水手 1 号任务的彻底失败。这次任务在当时花费了大约 1800 万美元，相当于今天的 1.5 亿美元。

英特尔推出深度伪造实时检测工具

深度伪造视频现在无处不在，你可能见过名人做或说他们实际上从未做过的事情的视频。英特尔开发了 FakeCatcher，这项技术能够以 96% 的准确率检测虚假人脸视频。这是世界上第一个实时深度伪造检测器，它可以在几毫秒内返回结果。该工具是通过检测视频像素中微妙的“血流”信号，在真实视频中寻找真实的线索。当心脏泵血时，人的静脉会改变颜色，这些血流信号是可以从面部各处收集的，算法将这些信号翻译成时空图。然后，利用深度学习，就可以立即检测出一个视频是真的还是假的。

                              <span>Product of the Month last year, and we couldn’t be more excited to bring you our iOS app AND support for Microsoft Outlook/Exchange accounts!

If you’re like me, you mostly check the calendar on your phone to see what meeting you have up next, but you&#x27;ll wait till you get to your computer when you have to send an invite. That’s a bug, not a feature. It shouldn&#x27;t be this hard to schedule a meeting from your phone in 2022.

Vimcal iOS makes scheduling on-the-go a breeze by giving you these superpowers on your phone:

* Drag and copy your availabilities 
* Convert time zones with 2 taps
* Look up your teammates’ calendars
* Use meeting templates to avoid filling in every detail
* And more!

It was our team&#x27;s top priority this year to craft the absolute best mobile app experience. What you see today is the result of 9 months iterating on feedback from our early TestFlight users.

The best part? The mobile app is free!

I’ll be here all day so feel free to drop a comment or book a 15-min Slot with me here to say hi &#x3D;)

LFG!! 🚀🚀

One of the advantages of working in a terminal is that it&#x27;s faster than most other interfaces. Thanks to the GNU Readline library and the built-in syntax of shells like Bash and Zsh, there are several ways to make your interactions with the command line even faster. Here are five ways to make the most of your time in the terminal.
1. Navigate without the arrow keys
While executing commands on the command line, sometimes you miss a part at the beginning or forget to add certain tags or arguments toward the end. It&#x27;s common for users to use the Left and Right arrow keys on the keyboard to move through a command to make edits.
There&#x27;s a better way to get around the command line. You can m…</span>

In my previous article, I provided an overview of possible community health metrics. I look at what you can do with those metrics in this article. You&#x27;ll see several examples from different communities, some of which you may be familiar with.
Contribution metric
I&#x27;ll start with the &quot;new contributors and contributions&quot; metric, which measures developers joining and leaving a community. I can measure this by seeing which developers made a commit during a specific period. Someone who shows up for the first time joined. Someone who hasn&#x27;t contributed for a while has probably left.
It is natural for developers to leave a project. Maybe they change jobs, have a change in priorities, or have personal reasons fo…</span>

如果你经常看赶海视频的话，对这些出镜率极高的海洋生物都不会感到陌生。近年来生活类自媒体的蓬勃发展，使得赶海1这一沿海地区的常见活动也得以进入镜头，并逐渐为大众所熟知。
然而，赶海真的像视频里那样，一袋食盐、一把小铲，在沙滩上挖几下，就能轻松收获一桶海鲜吗？镜头之外的真实赶海生活，是什么样子的呢？专业赶海人都如何赶海呢？
居住在北方某沿海城市的我，虽然不是一个专业的赶海人，但几次赶海下来，倒是收获了一肚子见闻，遂整理出这篇观察日记，以飨读者。
赶海群体：什么人在赶海？
第一类是专业赶海人。专业赶海人从外观上是最容易辨别出来的群体，他们的装备专业且齐全，从头戴式探照灯到防水雨裤，从钓竿到抽虾筒。他们干活熟练麻利，且通常不会聚集作业，而是分散开来、独自行动，一人承包一片区域，维持着互不侵犯、心照不宣的默契。对他们来说，赶海是经济收入的重要来源，他们所收获的海产品可用于贩卖，有时也会「拿回自己家做着吃」。
夜钓的大爷，穿着雨裤方便下海放鱼饵。交谈中大爷自述是因身背负债而每晚赶海。摄于10月29日。
第二类是业余赶海人，以村民和游客为主，他们的熟练程度、赶海目的也各不相同。
附近村庄的居民对赶海更熟悉些，更善于寻找海洋生物的呼吸孔。尽管装备不如专业赶海人那么齐全，但他们仅凭一把小铲子和一个小桶，也能有相当不错的收获，足够做一顿饭。一次赶海时，我们碰见了一对年轻的小情侣，听口音像是附近的村民，女生向我展示了当晚的收获——小半桶的狗虾，并「打算回去拿椒盐炒着吃」。
游客则多半是抱着玩乐的心态，将赶海当成一次有趣的家庭活动。

赶海攻略：时间，装备和收获
赶海时间
赶海前需要提前查好当地的潮汐时间表，重点关注水位高度和涨潮、落潮时间。每天的落潮时间有所不同，一般初一、十五会落大潮，海水退得更远，给赶海人提供了更广阔的探…</span>

Fluent Search 一款不满足于只提供「Fluent 流畅」搜索体验，还想在外观、交互、工作流上进一步拓展的高颜值搜索软件。
Fluent 设计 + 个性化
相关设置页面：外观、特效、主页
颜值就是生产力，这句话在 Windows 平台似乎并没有得到很好的验证，关注 Windows 的用户都知道微软虽有设计规范，但对软件生态的掌控力约等于没有，连自家应用也不一定会及时跟进，更何况第三方软件，因此在 Windows 平台上一款遵守规范且好看的应用是可遇不可求的。身为一款随时随地都有可能跟用户打交道的应用，好看的设计会让用户体验更上一层楼。以下是其三种搜索窗口基础样式：
搜索栏 + 自定义图标、水印窗口窗口 + 主页 &#x3D; 类开始菜单风格
Fluent Search 不仅自带不同风格的主题，同时也提供大量的选项让其更具个性化，从浅色、深色模式，到窗口样式、大小、字体、图标、水印、颜色、透明材质、动画等都可调整。不同于其它跨平台的应用，基于 C# 开发的 Fluent Search 可以快速跟进 Windows 新设计的同时仍有着原生的性能表现。

「流畅」搜索
相关设置页面：搜索、文件、标签、屏幕、应用内搜索、上下文、网页、进程、应用程序、UI
搜索可以说是该类软件的基本功，一个优秀的索引器决定着它的基础用户体验，Fluent Search 的索引器除了可以搜索文件、目录、设置、进程、应用程序、浏览器（火狐需要安装插件）书签和历史记录，还可以对部分格式进行全文搜索，当你只想查相关内容时，通过 files content 标签即可进行搜索，不过受限于性能，搜索内容需要超过 3 个字符才会进行搜索。
全文搜索
作为一款外国软件， Fluent Search 也提供了中文搜索，全拼、拼音首字母搜索都支持，…</span>

Twitter may be in big trouble when it comes to generating advertising revenue: GroupM, part of WPP, the world’s biggest ad company — and Twitter’s biggest spender — is reportedly telling its clients that buying ads on the platform is “high-risk,” according to Platformer and Digiday. That makes it the third advertising juggernaut telling massive corporations that they might want to take their money elsewhere, after IPG and Omnicom Media Group both recommended pausing advertisements on the platform.
GroupM works with companies like Google, L’Oréal, Bayer, Nestle, Unilever, Coke, and Mars. If you’ve ever seen that graphic about how a few brands make pretty much everything you buy at the grocery store, you’ll notice a lot of Venn diagram...

Twitter has seen thousands of layoffs, departures, and resignations since Elon Musk took over, but one of the latest staffing changes appears to have been personal — the company’s new CEO tweeted that Eric Frohnhoefer, an employee who had publicly argued with him on the platform, had been fired.
The saga started on Sunday, when Musk tweeted an apology for Twitter being slow in “many countries” and implied that the poor performance is because the app does over 1,000 “poorly batched” remote procedure calls to load the home timeline — basically saying the app has to reach out to other servers a bunch of times and wait for a response for each request. Frohnhoefer, who tweeted that he’s spent six years working on Twitter for Android, quote...

Nike’s still planning to get in on the non-fungible token (NFT) game, even though the NFT market is plummeting and the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume went bankrupt last week. The company’s launching what it calls .Swoosh, a Web3 platform that will eventually let users buy, sell, and trade virtual shoes and apparel.
Nike didn’t offer too many details about what exactly to expect but suggests that you will one day be able to use its assets as wearable items in digital games and “other immersive experiences.” While signups for the platform open on November 18th, don’t expect to actually buy anything: .Swoosh’s first digital collection doesn’t come out until next January. Once that happens, Nike says it’ll let creators...

The California Public Utilities Commission’s (CPUC) new solar energy proposal removes a previously proposed monthly grid tax that could’ve added hundreds of dollars per year to the cost of solar installations (via Reuters). 
The CPUC was looking to slash solar incentives for customers of investor-owned utilities and, in December, proposed charging a monthly fee of $8 per kilowatt to connect new solar customers to the grid. As pointed out by my colleague Justine Calma, some industry groups opposed the plan saying it “would end California’s solar boom,” which has made it the state with more rooftop solar than anywhere else in the US.

And in the experiments, I ended up generating 100s of beautiful images (all manually generated – one by one). And I decided to share them with everyone.

Get hold of them and support me.

Thank you

                              <span>Free to use - UX Dictionary is free for anyone who wants to understand UX better.

🤝 Community-driven - Everyone can contribute and request keywords. The idea is that we work on the dictionary together. Five people agreeing on a definition is more valuable than one designer’s opinion.

🔦 Show highlights for designers and business owners (coming soon) - All you have to do is flip the switch and see the highlights that are relevant to you. This works for aspiring designers and SaaS founders trying to add some UX to their products.

✍️ How does it impact me (coming soon) - Each keyword will include advice and recommended next steps for you to take. It’ll also have a list of useful resources if you want to learn more.

                              <span>大家好！今年早些时候，我在写《DNS 是如何工作的》 时，有人问我——为什么人们有时在域名的末尾加一个点？例如，如果你通过运行 dig example.com 查询 example.com 的 IP，你会看到一下内容：

$ dig example.com
example.com.        5678    IN  A   93.184.216.34


执行完 dig 命令后，example.com 有一个 . ——变成了 example.com.！发生了什么？

有些 DNS 工具也要求传给它的域名后加一个 .：如果你在使用 miekg/dns 时传给它 example.com，它会报错：

// trying to send this message will return an error
m :&#x3D; new(dns.Msg)
m.SetQuestion(&quot;example.com&quot;, dns.TypeA)


最初我以为我知道这个问题的答案（“呃，末尾的点意味着域名是完全限定的？”）。这是对的 —— 一个完全限定域名fully qualified domain name（FQDN）是一个末尾有 . 的域名！

但是为什么末尾的点是有用且重要的呢？

在 DNS 的请求/响应中，域名的末尾并没有 “.”

我曾经（错误地）认为 “为什么末尾有一个点？”的答案可能是 “在 DNS 请求/响应中，域名末尾有一个 .，所以我们把它放进去，以匹配你的计算机实际发送/接收的内容”。但事实并不是这样！

当计算机发送 DNS 请求/响应时，域名的末尾并没有点。实际上，域名中没有点。

域名会被编码成一系列的长度/字符串对。例如，域名 example.com 被编码为这 13 个字节。

7example3com0


编码后的内容一个点也没有…</span>

                              <span>本指南介绍了如何在没有互联网连接的情况下离线更新 Ubuntu 的步骤。


在很多情况下，你可能需要在没有互联网连接的情况下更新你的 Ubuntu 系统。你可能在外地不方便上网，也可能你需要更新一堆未联网的 Ubuntu，不管是哪种情况，保持你的系统更新最新的软件包总是需要的。

当然，始终建议通过联网来更新系统。

但有时，出于安全考虑，这是不行的。连接到互联网可能需要给你的系统进行额外的加固，以保护它们免受黑客和恶意软件的攻击。

以下的方法使用 apt-offline 来解决这些问题，并概述了在没有互联网的情况下离线更新 Ubuntu 的步骤。

准备环节


一台能连接到网络的 Ubuntu（你朋友的、咖啡馆、实验室系统）

存储了软件包的 U 盘

两个系统都安装了 apt-offline：一个系统离线，另一个系统联网


安装 apt-offline

在两个系统下安装 apt-offline。你可以使用以下命令安装：

sudo apt install apt-offline


如果你想在离线的目标系统安装 apt-offline，你可以提前下载到 U 盘里，然后复制到目标系统，再使用下面的命令安装。

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 和其他版本的下载链接如下所示。你可以选择一个镜像并下载 deb 文件。


下载 .deb 文件 – apt-offline


sudo dpkg -i name_of_package.deb


如何更新 Ubuntu

在离线的目标系统上打开终端，使用以下命令创建一个 .sig 签名文件：

sudo apt-offline set ~/offline-data.sig




在这个刚创建的签名文件中，包含下载所需的软件包的路径和详细信息。



把签名文件复制到 U 盘中，再插到联网的 Ubuntu 系统上。

在联网的 Ubuntu 上创建一个目录（参见下面）来存放这些文件。

打开一个终端，运行以下命令来下载所需的软件包。记得根据你的系统，更改下载目录和 .sig 签名文件的路径。

apt-offline get -d ~/offline-data-dir offline-data.sig




你可以看到文件相应下载，然后复制整个下载目录到 U 盘，再插到离线的 Ubuntu 系统。

运行以下命令将下载的软件包安装到离线系统，记得根据你的系统更改目录路径。

sudo apt-offline install offline-data-dir/




如果一切顺利，你将获得一个更新完的 Ubuntu。

重复以上步骤，就可以保持你的离线 Ubuntu 为最新版本。

希望以上教程能帮到你更新离线的 Ubuntu 系统，如果你遇到任何问题，请在下面的评论框中告诉我。

英伟达软件安全副总裁说，“面向测试的软件验证对安全来说根本不起作用，你可以对提供给用户的功能的质量有一个衡量标准，但对于安全问题，就没有什么作用，……很难知道你是否已经完成了。”幸运的是，有可能用数学方法证明你的代码的行为与它的规范精确一致。这个过程被称为“形式验证”。英伟达采用软件形式验证行业解决方案 SPARK 来证明软件的安全性。在几年前进行过概念验证后，现在许多英伟达产品在使用 SPARK 组件发布。

老王点评：形式验证是个好方法，但是不是那么容易掌握和推行。




JavaScript、Java、Python、Kotlin 和 Rust 开发者增长惊人

根据 SlashData 去年夏天从 163 个国家的 26000 多名开发者调查统计而成的第 23 期《开发者国家报告》，JavaScript 仍然是最大的编程语言社区，全球估计有 1960 万开发者每天都在使用 JavaScript；在过去的两年里，Java 社区的规模已经从 830 万增加到 1650 万，而同期开发者只增加了 50%；Python 在过去两年中增加了约 800 万新的开发人员；Kotlin 和 Rust 社区的规模在过去两年里都翻了一番。


消息来源：ZDNet



老王点评：开发人员越来越倾向于使用主流开发工具，所以流行的越发流行，但是这样就会扼杀一些创新。




密码学家建议考虑非晶格的后量子密码算法

目前许多密码学系统的安全性是基于大数的因数分解的，但因数分解的一个怪癖使其容易受到量子计算机的攻击。因此人们对上世纪 90 年代提出的“晶格密码学”寄予厚望，美国 NIST 选择的四个后量子密码学标准有三个采用晶格密码学。RSA 算法名称中的 S，Adi Shamir 对此表示担忧，“从某种意义上说，我们是把所有鸡蛋放在同一个篮子里”。今年夏天早些时候，一个有前途的后量子密码学方案不是用量子计算机，而是用一台普通的笔记本电脑破解的。

老王点评：确实如此，只有一种抗量子的密码理论，很难说会不会被发现潜在的弱点。</span>

                              <span>时至今日，世界上已经有成百上千种不同的 Linux 发行版。

它们中的大多数都可以被划归为三个大类 : Debian、Red Hat（Fedora）以及 Arch Linux。

使用基于 Debian/Ubuntu、Red Hat/SUSE 或者 Arch 的 Linux 发行版自然有它们的优势。它们很受大众欢迎，因此它们的包管理器能够提供大量的软件包。

然而，有一些用户更倾向于使用从头开始构建、独立于 DEB/RPM 这类包管理系统之外的发行版。

在这篇文章当中，我们将列出一些优秀的独立 Linux 发行版。


注意 : 显然，下面的列表显然不会包括一些广受欢迎，通常作为创建新发行版的基础的发行版，如 Debian、Ubuntu 和 Fedora 等。此外，列表顺序不分先后，没有特定的排名。


1、NixOS



NixOS 最初发布于 2003 年，NixOS 建立在 Nix 包管理器之上。它每年发布两个版本，通常是在 5 月和 11 月。

NixOS 可能不是一个直接面向新用户或普通用户的发行版。然而，其独特的 包管理 方法吸引了各种用户。

此外，它仍然支持 32 位系统。

其他特性：


构建隔离的包

可靠的升级，并且具有回滚功能

可重现的系统配置



NixOS


2、Gentoo Linux



Geetoo Linux 是一个主要针对操作系统专家的独立 Linux 发行版。它是为那些希望自由定制、微调和优化操作系统以满足其要求的用户而构建。

Gentoo 使用 Portage 包管理器 来创建和安装软件包，通常还允许你针对你的硬件来优化它们。Chrome 的开源版本 Chromium OS 便是使用 Gentoo 作为其核心的。

                              <span>以下是如何在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版中提高笔记本和桌面的音量的方法。


你有没有觉得你的 Ubuntu 笔记本的音量太小，尽管你把音量调到了 100%？我相信你有过。主要原因是：很明显，笔记本电脑的扬声器输出强度比大型扬声器要低。

此外，Ubuntu 和其他发行版将默认的最大音量设置为 100%，也就是 0dB（分贝）。0dB 是最大音量的参考值。做个比较，如果你把音量设置为 -10dB，这意味着你的音量比最大的 0dB 安静。

VLC 和一些媒体播放器允许你将音量提高到 200%。在最新的 Ubuntu 中使用一些设置，你可以将音量进一步提高。


注意：在你尝试和使用以下方法之前，请记住，每个扬声器都有其制造商设定的硬件限制。偶尔一次，播放超过 100% 的音频是可以的。但是，连续放大到更高的分贝可能会使输出的音频失真，并且从长远来看可能会损坏你的扬声器。因此，在使用时要小心谨慎，并有所限制。

从应用菜单中打开“设置Settings”，进入“声音Sound”标签。

启用 “过度放大Over Amplification” 开关。在你启用的那一刻，你应该看到音量条被扩大了。



现在你可以享受音量提升来听音乐了。

Fedora、Arch Linux 和其他发行版

如果你使用带有 GNOME 的 Fedora 工作站，你将看不到上述选项，因为这是 Ubuntu 特有的设置。见下面。



因此，对于任何其他 Linux 发行版（Arch、Fedora、RedHat 等）或桌面（KDE、Xfce、LXQt 等），打开终端并安装 PulseAudio 音量控制器。

Fedora、RedHat Linux、OpenSUSE 等基于 RPM 的发行版：

sudo dnf install pavucontrol


对于 Arch Linux、Manjaro：

sudo pacman -S pavucontrol


基于 Ubuntu 的非 GNOME 发行版：

sudo apt install pavucontrol


如何使用

安装后，从应用菜单中打开 pavucontrol，它应该有个 &amp;ldquoulseAudio Volume Control” 菜单项。



总结

记住，上述方法可以提高整个系统的扬声器音量。这意味着系统的声音和警报也会受到影响。所以，要记住这一点。正如我前面提到的，如果连续使用，提升扬声器音量超过 100% 可能会导致扬声器变形或损坏。

我希望这个教程能帮助你提高系统音量。如果你遇到问题，请在评论栏里告诉我。

The core of open source is about using, sharing, and collaborating in software creation. With its roots in the free software movement and ensuring the rights of software users, open source has evolved from being solely the work of volunteers and hobbyists to also include the enterprise.
Collaborative software development has taken on a new dimension in the last 5 to 10 years. Today open source makes up 58% of software in the enterprise. In fact, 63% of companies in a 2021 survey indicated wanting to increase their use and engagement with open source.
Open source is everywhere and forms the digital infrastructure we rely on. The US issued a directive mandating more software supply chain securit…</span>

Zram is a compressed RAM disk on Linux. Lately, it&#x27;s been put to use for swap space on many distributions. In my previous article, I introduced zram and demonstrated how to use it. In this article, I cover some of the ways you can customize how your system puts zram to use.
Augmented swap
Zram swap can be augmented with standard secondary storage devices. Adding some traditional swap space can be especially useful on systems with low amounts of RAM. (Such augmentation isn&#x27;t normally useful on hosts with very large amounts of RAM.)
If you do choose to augment swap with some type of storage device, hard drives do still work but are significantly slower than using SSD in either SATA or m.2 formats. However, t…</span>

                              <span>2014 年，那时候我还在读大三，某一天突然萌发了一个想法，要将自己看过的书和电影记录下来。我隐隐约约感受到，沉淀自己的精神生活，竟然让我觉得人生充满意义。记录的瞬间让我觉得会有成就感；等哪天，拿起这份清单，我可以清楚回顾某段时间内看过了哪些书籍和电影，也从侧面知晓当时精神生活的丰富程度
从那时起，我的记录习惯从未断绝过，不知不觉已经 8 年。从最初的用豆瓣记录，到使用纯文本 Markdown 记录，到自己搭建博客，再到使用公众号留言自动生成博客的方式记录。有些方式比较 Geek，不适合普通人，直到去年，我开发了一款 App，来满足跟我有同样需求的普通用户
这就是「已阅：书影记录」，一款快速记录自己看过的书籍和电影的 App，并支持将精美的观影列表和书单海报一键分享给朋友。献给所有希望构建自己精神角落的人

细数曾经那些不够好用的工具
为什么要开发「已阅：书影记录」呢？我综合对比了市面上多款工具，发现如果想要记录自己看过的书籍或电影，使用的方式不外乎以下几类
Excel
这是一类以 Excel 为代表的纯手动记录工具，除了 Excel 还包括在线文档、Notion 甚至是手写到自己的笔记本等
这个方式无疑费时费力，且数据是死的，很难被二次利用（如灵活筛选、统计、分享等）
让人惊讶的是，用这个方式记录的人还真不少，毕竟大部分人找不到更好的办法
豆瓣
豆瓣很伟大，是中文互联网上最全面的书影音资料库。功能上非常丰富，但是正因为它太全了，很难在这个垂直功能上做到极致

豆瓣记录的步骤比较麻烦，且默认会被分享到公共领域，下图是豆瓣和已阅的记录界面对比

 
「豆瓣」和「已阅」的记录界面对比
无法快速回顾，比如我想查看 2022 年看过了哪些书或我看过的所有五星电影，豆瓣都无法支持
「已阅」可以方便地筛选
分享功能缺乏自定义，比如我想自定义分享 2022 年看过了哪些书或我看过的所有五…</span>

挪威大众汽车公司声称已经制造了一把办公椅，它不仅看起来配得上《星际迷航》中的船长，而且还能用自己的五个轮子在办公室里行驶，速度高达每小时 20 公里。它的可更换电池可以行驶 12 公里。而且，它还有很多装备：360 度防撞传感器、“倒车”摄像头、带加热的刺绣座椅、派对灯、触摸屏显示器、USB 充电器、口袋式的“后备箱”，甚至还有拖车。

苹果自带的应用无视用户隐私设置

有专家发现苹果应用商店向该公司发送用户在应用中的几乎所有信息，尽管 iPhone 的隐私设置声称在关闭时 “完全禁用设备分析的共享”。研究人员发现，这个问题在苹果的大部分内置 iPhone 应用套件中都存在。测试发现，苹果在收到这些数据的同时，还能识别你和你的设备，包括 ID、手机类型、联网方式等等。有用户已经于周四在加州联邦法院提起集体诉讼。

                              <span>分享一些我最喜欢的开源写作工具。


在我的职业生涯中，我已经写过很多东西，主要是作为一名 IT 顾问，创建产品文档作为给的客户可交付成果。这些文档通常针对不同操作系统和软件产品提供说明。

自 2018 年，我开始在 www.opensource.com 上发表关于开源软件的文章。当然，我使用开源软件进行协作。接下来我将介绍我使用过的四款开源编辑器。

1、Vi

Vi 也被称为 Vim（LCTT 校注：此外不确，Vi 和 Vim 是两个软件，只是 Vim 取代了 Vi，并以 vi 的名字运行。），是我学习的第一款开源编辑器。这是我在计算机科学课程中学习的编辑器，并且我所有的 C 语言编程都是通过它完成的。自 1995 年以来，实际上我一直使用它作为命令行编辑器。这款工具有多个迭代版本，以至于我都可以为之写一系列文章了。我只想说，在我的日常使用中，我坚持使用它的基本命令行形式，并进行最小的定制。

2、LibreOffice Writer

Writer 是 LibreOffice 开源办公套件的一部分。它是由文档基金会Document Foundation维护的全功能文字处理器。它支持行业标准格式，例如开放文档格式 （ODF）、Open XML 和 MS Office DOC、DOCX。可以在其官方网站上 了解有关 Writer 的更多信息。

3、Ghostwriter

Ghostwriter 是一个用于 Markdown 的文本编辑器。它有一个很好的实时查看器和语法指南或备忘单功能。访问官方网站 了解更多内容。

4、Gedit

Gedit 是许多 Linux 发行版中的基本图形编辑器，被描述为“用于 GNOME 桌面的小型轻量级文本编辑器”。我最近开始使用它来创建 Asciidoc 格式的文章。使用 Asciidoc 的好处是语法易于管理并可导入到 Drupal 等 Web 渲染系统中。通过 Gedit Wiki 了解许多提示和技巧。

编辑文本

开源世界中有大量编辑软件。随着我继续写作，这个列表可能会增加。我的主要目标是格式简单。我希望我的文章易于在互联网平台上导入、转换和发布。

你的写作风格、功能需求和目标受众将指导你确定首选工具。

                              <span>Ubuntu 21.10 “Impish Indri” 及之后的版本将 Firefox Snap 设为默认浏览器。如果你不喜欢 Snap，可以通过以下方式将其删除并使用库存版本。


关于 Snap 是否是 APT 的更好替代品，一直存在争议。而许多用户更喜欢 Snap 系统，也有一些人非常讨厌它。Ubuntu 和 Canonical 认为它是 Linux 的最佳安装仓库和包管理工具之一。 Snap 被讨厌的主要原因是它的启动很慢。然而，这个论点是另一篇文章的内容。

从 Ubuntu 中删除 Firefox Snap 版本

所以，如果你还没有 听说过这件事，Ubuntu 21.10（和所有后续版本）默认提供 Firefox Snap 包。因此，当你从 Ubuntu 21.10 开始安装时，默认的左侧停靠区的快捷方式是 Firefox 的 Snap 版本。你可以使用以下各种方法对其进行验证。





如果你因为 性能 和存储问题而不喜欢 Snap，可以通过以下命令将其删除。

如果已经打开，那么关闭所有 Firefox 实例。

打开一个终端。然后运行以下命令：

sudo snap remove firefox


等待命令完成。这将从你的系统中删除它的 Snap 可执行文件，并断开 Firefox 与各种系统服务的连接。但是主目录下的 Snap 目录仍然存在。你可以使用以下命令手动删除它：

cd ~/snap
rm -r firefox


安装 Firefox 替代方法

现在，当你删除了 Firefox，你可以通过以下方式来使用此浏览器。

方法 1 – 使用 PPA（推荐）

在使用此方法之前，请确保如上删除了 Firefox 的 Snap 版本。

有一个 官方 Firefox PPA，由其开发团队维护。你可以将此 …</span>

                              <span>SoX Sound Exchange 甚至可以为你的音频文件添加特效。




我工作需要使用音视频媒体，不管你处理哪种媒体，你肯定知道标准化是一种有价值的工具。就像你不会试图把一个分数加到一个小数上而不转换其中一个一样，我已经知道，把不同格式的媒体组合起来并不理想。为了方便用户，大多数爱好者级应用程序使转换过程不可见。然而，对于那些需要控制媒体细节的用户的灵活软件，会通常让你自己提前将媒体转换为所需的格式。我有一些最喜欢的音频转换工具，其中之一就是号称“音频的瑞士军刀” —— SoX。

安装

在 Linux 或 BSD 上，可以从软件存储库或 Ports 树中安装 sox 命令（，以及一些有用的符号链接）。

你也可以从 Sourceforge.net 上安装 SoX。它不经常发布，但它的代码库往往是稳定的，所以如果你想要最新的功能（如 Opus 支持），构建它是容易和安全的。

SoX 主要提供了 sox 命令，但是创建了一些有用的符号链接：play、rec 和 soxi。

使用 SoX 获取文件信息

SoX 可以读取和重写音频数据。它是否存储重写的音频数据取决于你。在有些情况下，你不需要存储转换后的数据，例如，当你将输出直接发送到扬声器进行回放时。然而，在进行任何转换之前，最好首先确定要处理的是什么。

使用 soxi 命令也可以收集音频文件信息。soxi 会符号链接到 soxi --info。

In the Java programming language, a hashmap is a list of associated values. Java uses hashmaps to store data. If you keep a lot of structured data, it&#x27;s useful to know the various retrieval methods available.

Create a hashmap
Create a hashmap in Java by importing and using the HashMap class. When you create a hashmap, you must define what constitutes a valid value (such as Integer or String). A hashmap holds pairs of values.

在经历了成都连续的半个月高温居家办公，以及两周的疫情封控后，我思考了一下关于城市生活与孤独的关系，以及如何排解孤独，理解孤独。在这一个多月中，我一直是一个人在屋子里，未曾踏出家一步。我不是一个爱做饭柴米油盐的人，就这样，在家中面对着日复一日的琐事，面对没有人可以说话的孤独，面对着工作、生活的焦虑。在与安静和极度的自由的碰撞里，除了偶尔的空虚与崩溃以外，我想分享一下我如何逐渐的找回自己的生活节奏，并喜欢上一个人安排自己的方方面面。
孤独是什么

如果我们所期待的人际关系数量和质量与我们当前实际情形存在较大差距，就会产生令人不悦的厌烦、悲伤和绝望的孤独体验（de Jong Gierveld et al.，2006）。

孤独有两种：
其一是社会隔离，指缺少朋友和熟人的社交。
你或许也有这样的感受，常常用「社恐」来武装自己，鲜少与人交流。那怕是点个外卖、出门买个东西都是能不交流就不交流。性格内向的人更喜欢和自己交流，陶醉在自己所热爱的精神世界之中。在周末和假期，相比和朋友出去游玩他们更倾向于选择在家中折腾自己的爱好，渐渐的在和陌生人交往时变的畏惧，不知所措。久而久之，除了身边寥寥无几的挚友以外，几乎没有任何的交流，孤独感进一步加深。
其二是情感隔离，指缺少亲密而深厚的情感关系。
人生活在社会中，总是会渴望着被他人理解的。有的人虽然辗转于各种聚会，时时刻刻都沉浸在热闹场合之中，但是浮于表面的热闹并不总是意味着有人真正了解自己。可能你真正渴望的目标无人诉说，心中的艰苦无人知晓。理解就像是人生的底色，我们渴望着，但却不可能有人能完全理解自己。
孤独的危害
对于大部分人来说，长期保持孤独是有一定危害的。
在生理上，长期孤独的人血压更高，更容易发生应激反应。在晚上的时候孤独也会让人辗转反侧，不仅睡眠质量下降，免疫力也会随之一起走下坡路。
在生活中，孤独有时候也会带来不少的麻烦，比如因…</span>

Like many people, I find social media somewhat exciting and also...a bit much. Sometimes you get deep-fried in algorithms, tracking data, and ads catered especially for you. You lack administrative control over what you want to see, especially on the old platforms many of us are used to. As usual, you must look to open source to fix the problem. And that&#x27;s exactly what Mastodon, an open source microblogging community, does.
With Mastodon social, not only are you working with open source software, but everything is decentralized, which means you can pick what you want to see partly based on the instance you want to occupy. Mastodon uses separate instances, each with its own code of conduct, privacy o…</span>

I spend a lot of time playing (I mean working) on my computers, and I&#x27;ve found a lot of interesting things. One that has most recently come to my attention is the zram0 device. I first noticed it when working on one of my Opensource.com articles several months ago. It showed up in the output from the lsblk command:
# lsblk
8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk
8:1    0   600M  0 part
[...]
252:0    0     8G  0 disk [SWAP]

It&#x27;s identified as swap space, which is what first piqued my curiosity, so I did some exploration. Zram was originally called &quot;compcache,&quot; which stands for &quot;compressed cache.&quot; It turns out that zram is a tool for creating an in-RAM compressed cache, specifically for use as swap space.
But Why?

Social media is not always sociable, and sometimes we need a sufficient impetus to change what we do and what we read. I began using Twitter as a replacement for my RSS reader in 2008, which revolutionized how I read and learned up to that point. Tweets from educators and free and open source (FOSS) advocates worldwide kept me informed and engaged in a learning network that was without equal. That&#x27;s changed over the past half dozen years, and recently a change in ownership and the shaping of what I read was driven more by an algorithm than by my personal interests and choices. During a yearly meetup of correspondents and editors of Opensource.com a few years ago, Seth Kenlon suggested giving Ma…</span>

Thanks to the ShardingSphere community&#x27;s continuous review and feedback to develop features such as data sharding and read/write splitting, our team found that some users create many shards when using the data sharding feature.
In such cases, there can be 1,000 physical tables corresponding to a sharding logical table, which disturbs users.
For instance, a SELECT * FROM t_order statement will lead to a full-route, which is obviously not the case for OLTP. This SQL can be placed in another Proxy to avoid blocking other requests.
However, if users are not familiar with Proxy or how to write a where condition and don&#x27;t know that sharding is not supported in this condition, a full-route is still r…</span>

                              <span>我在 如何搭建知识库 中，将知识库的结构分为了「树状结构」和「网络结构」两种。
树状结构是自上而下的，网络结构是自下而上的。
但知识还有多少种结构呢？为什么是这两种？
知识本质上是信息的一种，想了解知识的结构，也可以类比信息的结构。一直以来我回答不好这个问题。
日复一日，在日常使用知识库和产品经理的工作中，无论是对知识库中的每一张知识卡片进行整理，还是在工作中经常需要查看数据库的数据结构，都将我指向一个词「信息架构」
于是，我想起了那本经典的的「北极熊」之书 —— 《信息架构 超越 Web 设计》
并且，我在这本三年前读过的书里，找到了现在的我想要的答案。

信息结构
在《信息架构》这本书中，将信息分为了以下三种结构
组织系统：组织结构可以分为互补的三种结构
层级结构
以数据库为导向的模式
超文本

信息结构会定义用户浏览的主要方式。适用于信息架构的主要组织结构包括层级结构 、以数据库为导向的模式和超文本，每种组织结构都有其优缺点。在某些情况下，只使用一 种是合理的。但在很多情况下，需要以互补的方式使用这 3 种组织 结构。 —— 《信息架构》第六章

看到这三个结构，我恍然大悟，觉得非常了不起。
简单的三种结构，几乎可以用来解释现在所有的笔记软件。
下面我将介绍每一种结构在知识库软件中的运用。结合我日常的使用经历，也给出一些建议。
（注：目前市面上可以作为知识库的软件有很多。我只选取我有使用过的软件作为本次功能的介绍。也就是 Notion、Obsidian、Logseq、wolai…）

信息结构会定义用户浏览的主要方式。适用于信息架构的主要组织结构包括层级结构 、以数据库为导向的模式和超文本， 每种组织结构都有其优缺点。

层级结构
层级结构，即是上一层级包括下一层级的结构。
层级结构的优势和劣势都很明显。优势是其层次清晰，劣势是维护成本高。
层级结构的广度和深度均不宜…</span>

又到双十一购物节，说来有趣，每年双十一我都会关注羽绒服这一品类，原因大概是冬天即将到来，我隐约有添购衣服的担忧，可又因为此时我还身穿短袖，买羽绒服有种错季购物的感觉，在将羽绒服加入购物车后往往又放弃下单。于是这些年，每到双十一，我的购物车里的羽绒服更新一次，羽绒服照片成了淘宝的皮肤挂件，年年换新。
我当然是有买羽绒服，但往往不是购物车里那件，我在淘宝上浏览的是万元左右的始祖鸟、Moncler、加拿大鹅，加入购物车里的是两千元左右的北面，但最终购买的是千元以内的波司登和优衣库轻薄款，哦对了，还有老家线下店铺的以纯羽绒服。
不过长期以往，我倒是对羽绒服有了足够多的了解，足以写下这篇有参考价值的文章，帮助人们选购羽绒服。
羽绒服的历史
人类自古以来就有利用动物皮毛御寒的历史，早在原始社会时期，人类祖先就已经初步掌握了将兽皮制作成衣物的方法，用兽皮和树叶蔽体防寒，后来逐渐出现麻、棉、丝等纺织物，人类衣物变得丰富。相对来说，人类利用禽类羽毛御寒的历史要短得多，在唐朝，人们用鹅绒和布混合填充在被子中，在十三四世纪的欧洲，人们用鸭和鹅的羽毛填充进被套中。
直到 1940 年，现代羽绒服才被发明出来，主角是美国的艾迪·鲍尔，作为一名狂热户外运动爱好者，他在一次户外钓鱼过程中差点冻死，于是决心制作一件真正保暖的外套。鲍尔找到了鹅毛的羽绒，又恰逢杜邦实验室在 1938 年发明了尼龙，尼龙织物质地紧密，与棉布相比，尼龙面料可以防止羽绒「钻绒」，于是，他将二者结合，把羽绒填充进尼龙面料的衣服，绗缝锁绒，并将第一件羽绒外套命名为「Skyliner」，申…</span>

✔️ Design Token with token layering from branding down to the component level
✔️ Design Token utilizing semantic naming
✔️ Instantly use best practice defaults, or make it your own entirely
✔️ Full flexibility to help you in creating your own Design System:

26 ready to implement components with 
250+ available properties and
500+ tokens to help you make the best design decisions

Setting up a code first Design System has never been easier
the real work.

前言
毋庸置疑，如今的 Chrome 及其他基于 Chromium 的 Blink 内核浏览器因其速度快、网页兼容性好的优点，以绝对的优势占据了浏览器市场的主导地位。但与此同时，因为 Chrome 与 Chromium 被一家号称「不作恶」但处处作恶的公司所拥有，所以经常被诟病存在隐私问题。许多想要逃离 Chrome 统治的人都转向了更加自由的 Firefox 浏览器，尽管其母公司 Mozilla 近年来也是骚操作不断，但 Firefox 仍然是除 Chromium 的 Blink 和 Safari 的 WebKit 外唯一选择。
我曾经也很喜欢用 Chrome（或者说是 Chromium），使用 ArchLinux 作为主力系统的我，官方软件源中使用开源 Chromium 代码编译出的 Chromium 浏览器在当时体验基本与谷歌官方的闭源 Chrome 一致。促使我转向使用 Firefox 的契机开始于一年多前，谷歌限制了第三方浏览器对其数据同步 API 的使用，这样一来各家发行版自行编译的 Chromium 浏览器都失去了账户同步功能，这在当时引起了很多不满。从那时开始，我就开始尝试使用 Firefox 替代 Chromium 作为我的主力浏览器，并最终彻底淘汰掉了 Chromium。
无独有偶，谷歌又宣布将会在 2022 年底彻底禁用 Manifest V2 规范（后来又推迟了半年），作为替代者的 Manifest V3 规范，用谷歌的话说是为了「保护用户隐私」，限制了浏览器扩展的很多权限，其中影响最大的是禁用了 We…</span>

                              <span>本次更新：
前几天看了「赛博朋克：边缘行者」，觉得里面的拖影效果非常有趣，就在 app 里做了一下。

App 介绍：
CUBE 是一款结合 iOS 软硬件新特性来完成实时特效的 app ，希望大家在手机上就可以玩到有趣的特效。 以我看过的热门影音作品为灵感，已经完成下面三个主要特效：
LiDAR 扫描效果：
日本女团 Perfume 在 Flow 的 MV 中大量使用点云这种技术，而正好配备 LiDAR 的 iPhone 可以感知深度，生成点云。
 
采样实时图像与 LiDAR 扫描仪生成的深度图，生成 3D 粒子（点云）。至多可生成 3,000,000 个粒子。
将生成的 3D 粒子与现实世界的场景混合在一起，让你感觉身处超现实世界。

Matrix 效果：
之前 黑客帝国 4 上映，黑客帝国又变成热门话题，就很想复刻一下经典的 code rain 。
 
这一次会选蓝色药丸还是红色药丸？

液态金属效果：
 
既然都提到了黑客帝国，那么终结者也不能不提。贯穿全系列的液态金属杀手也是经典之一。CUBE 带你回到 1991 年，化身成为詹姆斯·卡梅隆所拍摄的电影「终结者 2：审判日」中的终结者 T-1000 。

兑换码：
如果你对上面三个特效感兴趣，你可以在这里找到兑换码。
（我把码都放到一个 notion page 里，可以回复用掉的兑换码编号，方便我编辑。）

                              <span>如何让枯燥的读书像看剧、享受美食、打游戏一样快乐？
读书上瘾模型，让读书成为一个上瘾循环。

上学的时候我比较喜欢玩游戏，但是在图书馆有很好的学习看书的氛围，游戏玩得比较少。毕业后，不再有看书的氛围了，玩游戏的频率逐渐增加，从每周1天增加到2天、后来逐步增加到7天，每天都玩游戏。
那个时候我意识到已经游戏上瘾了，打游戏占据了太多的时间，所以决定戒掉游戏，经过几次尝试，终于在2020年把游戏戒掉了。

即从游戏上瘾转变为读书上瘾，读书包括输入和输出两个步骤。输入指的是看书，从去年开始在豆瓣记录读书情况，利用周末和工作日的被动等待时间，每个月最多读过11本书。
输出分为写、说、实践3种形式。

写，发表长篇博客或简短的书评。
说，分为线上和线下两种形式，线上指在各个自媒体平台发布读书视频；线下指面对面形式，1对1的交流沟通或1对多的分享。
实践，看书不应该只停留在改变认知的程度，还要实践、改变自己的行为习惯。比如看了一本关于运动的书，不仅要有每天都运动的认知，还要付诸于每天的实践行动。

上一次玩游戏是在2020年，接下来详细介绍如何从游戏上瘾转变为读书上瘾。

PBTFANS KABUKI-CHO 歌舞伎町
2022.4 
IC Base
这套键帽是由设计师OAY （罗马音？大概能翻译成哦呀，语气词）设计的第二套键帽，此前他还设计过pbtfans的深海来客，感兴趣的可以看我之前盘点的蓝色系键帽。
这套歌舞伎町键帽，灵感来源于日本的歌舞伎町——东京的娱乐中心之一。电影院、电玩舞厅、酒吧等等，从深夜到黎明，也是为数不多的大型红灯区，我对于歌舞伎町最深刻的印象则是来自于《银魂》中主角团所居住的歌舞伎町一条街。
配色：

这次的配色非常丰富，主要还是由于个性部分选用多种不同色彩。键帽整体底色以深蓝暗色调为主，而字符和个性选用明亮的色调，如同霓虹灯招牌的颜色，侧面烘托出歌舞伎町“不眠之街”的名号，到深夜依然灯火通明、灯红酒绿。
个性部分：
大货版本
这次的现货销售是直接将个性和base进行了捆绑，还包含了四个颜色的盖帽。
个性部分主要由歌舞伎、酒精和没事组成，以及歌舞伎町的招牌和著名的“一丁目”。颜色上也是选择非常丰富，盖帽倒是提供了一种略微复古但俏皮的感觉，七字回车则是意味着现代的电力为这般灯红酒绿提供了便利。
搭配展示：
该键帽已经开售有一段时间，所以已经有玩家提供了实拍的照片，有这些实物图，能更好的帮助我们来判断是否购入。

键帽信息：
材质：PBT材质
高度：原厂高度
工艺：二色工艺
厂商：PBTFANS
淘宝有售卖，据悉歌舞伎町卖的很好，货量有限，kbd自己的店铺已经卖完了，经销商仍有现货。 
个人评分:7-8（深色键帽非常耐看，歌舞伎町的主题也很新鲜，个性颜色丰富,PBTFANS代工水平不错）
购买建议：喜欢这个主题的值得入手，现货也无需等待

                              <span>前言
仔细翻了翻我个人的钢笔产品分享，和大家讨论过的都是以著名品牌的钢笔产品为主，对于国内钢笔品牌主要还是分享英雄旗下的经典产品与创新之作，毕竟其它钢笔品牌以我个人的眼光去看，都是没有太多购买意义的产品。
对于钢笔入门我始终推荐白金preppy系列、白金小流星系列、百乐78g、凌美狩猎者这些海外品牌的平价款式。
但因为英雄的关系，国人对于暗尖结构的钢笔有着相当的偏好，并且海外知名品牌如今也没有任何纯粹的现产暗尖钢笔产品。所以如今暗尖钢笔的赛道上全是国产钢笔品牌，并且价位主战场就是十元上下的低端市场，本篇中，我在某多多以零售价格，购买了十余款销量出色的国产暗尖，文内将从暗尖钢笔的用料、设计、特点来对它们进行全面的横评对比，希望能为大家了解这些产品带来帮助。
暗尖钢笔的发源与如今价位分布

暗尖钢笔发源于人类历史上最为成功的钢笔派克51，其诞生于1939年，暨派克成立51周年，故因此得以型号命名。
派克51的暗尖结构，通过树脂包裹了笔尖，在当年革新性得提高了钢笔的气密性，并根据结构，设计了新一代的毛细供墨系统，达到了更为稳定的书写效果。
在当年，暗尖钢笔以这两点综合的超强实用性，得到了市场的一致认可，直至停产派克51累计销售4000万支，是人类历史上最为成功的系列钢笔。
之所以停产，是因为后续钢笔的气密性与供墨毛细结构材料随着现代工业不断革新，暗尖已经不再具备核心优势。
现在的暗尖钢笔从高到底个人认为是三个层次，首先是派克前年复刻了51，做了个包住明尖的假暗尖，是目前价格最高的笔款，但不怎么值得去买。其次是英雄100代表了国产暗尖金笔，曾经100多元的价格性价比非常好，如今价格普遍要200以上，还是可以买，但没曾经的极致性价比了；最后就是本篇讲的10元上下，国产的钢尖暗尖钢笔！
暗尖钢笔的特点

一、暗尖钢笔因为笔尖露出部分少，书写时可以产生形变的笔尖体积相对较小，所以书写时感…</span>

在 Android 手机的宣传稿中，我们经常能听到厂商宣传其所搭载的图像传感器型号，例如索尼 IMX***、三星 S5K***、豪威 OV**** 等。但在 iPhone 的宣传中，我们就不曾听过苹果声明 iPhone 使用的图像传感器型号，一般都是使用「传感器面积增大了百分之几」「像素更大更深」「全新的高速传感器」之类的比较模糊的用词，所以对于历代 iPhone 具体使用何种传感器，互联网上有诸多不能明确的信息。此文意在将我自己搜集到的相关信息进行梳理，试图考证它们的可靠性，为之后写作 iPhone 图像传感器进化打下基础。

首先给出我整理后的部分信息，点击图片可看原图，欢迎指正。

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://sspai.com/post/76663">

                              <span>写在最前面，CFE卡贵谁都知道，但是这玩意性能是真的强，不管你现在用不用得着，都建议你收藏一下，虽然现在买不起，但是梦想还是要有的嘛！
CFE-A卡是索尼从A7S3开始使用的新一代高速存储设备，以应对越来越大的视频录制码率。早先使用CFE-A卡的机型都比较贵（A7S3,FX3,A1等），受众并不多。但从A7M4的大卖和FX30的发布，越来越多的用户开始使用支持CFE-A卡的相机，如何选购一张合适的CFE-A卡就成了许多用户头疼的问题。
懂数码的都知道，索尼虽然“爱好广泛”，但唯独没有生产研发存储产品的业务，也就是说索尼的卡都是其他厂家代工的贴牌产品，理论上是不可能干得过拥有独立生产研发存储颗粒的品牌的，所谓的索尼大法黑科技在存储领域也仅仅是索尼粉丝自己加上的滤镜而已。
由于CFE-A卡是索尼独占的新卡型，在发布之初的相当长一段时间里都只有索尼原厂的卡可以选择，因为缺少比较的竞品，让许多人养成了原厂&#x3D;最好的固有印象。
如今第三方的CFE-A品牌越来越多，索尼原厂卡到底是个什么水平，终于可以有一个正经的横向比较了。
市面上可以做CFE-A卡的品牌有索尼，雷克沙，天硕，和至誉科技四家，笔者手里正好分别有一张拿来比较测试，他们是

索尼原厂的80G，官方售价699;
分别是雷克沙的320G，官方售价5599带读卡器;
天硕的80G，官方售价399；
至誉科技的120G，官方售价1599;

少数派不让带货就不放链接了。

之所以价格区间跨度很大，从几百到几千，主要是为了照顾不同经济实力的用户。
测试采用的读卡器是雷克沙的RW530，是一个CFA和SD卡双卡槽的读卡器，采用USB 3.2gen2接口，两个卡槽可以同时工作，可以实现互拷的功能。

一、性能对比
1、索尼80G

首先出场的是原厂的80G，由于这张卡是在套机里一起售卖的，拆机卡很多，只要六七百。买的人很多，不过大多数都舍…</span>

                              <span>作为一名iPhone用户，快捷指令是系统中我觉得很有趣但实际上用得不是很多的应用。
最初对快捷指令的理解仅限于将多个操作步骤简化成一个，最直观的应用就是在功能日益繁杂的APP中实现功能的一键直达，比如疫情期间的健康码。
但深入探究一番后，我认为快捷指令的本质其实是打破各个APP沙盒的壁垒，实现不同应用程序的能力互通，提升个人的自动化水平。
但事情情况并不尽如人意，虽然快捷指令编辑器提供了足够强大的编辑器，但三方应用对其支持并不好，大多数APP还是尽可能期望把用户圈在自己的生态中，没有开放足够的能力出来，这也是一款生态级应用的无奈。
想象中的快捷指令
现在应用商店的APP已经足够多，可以帮助人们解决足够多的问题，但有时候一款应用并不能完全解决某项任务，需要多个应用配合操作，如果用户可以随意调用应用中功能并组合成自己所需要完成特定任务的能力，那么用户体验和效率都将提升到新的高度。
想象一种场景，当我在观看自己感兴趣的外语视频时，因为语言的障碍可能不能足够理解视频内容，我需要一些辅助支持：我希望翻译软件能够帮我把外语翻译成母语，甚至希望语音合成软件将翻译后的语言读出来。孤立地看这个场景中的每个需求，都有应用能很好得实现：视频网站能够提供我感兴趣的内容，翻译软件能将语言进行较高准确度的翻译，语音合成软件能够将文字朗读出来。但是当这三个需求点分布在三个不同的APP时，用户就难以较高效率完成这个场景的任务。实际上每个APP的能力都被封锁在了自己APP里面。

上面说的这个场景我自己就有，但是因为没能使用现有工具很好使用，只得自己动手做了一个插件，可以朗读B站上面带有字幕的视频，因为微软的中文语音合成做得比较好，所以先放在Edge浏览器上了，目前还只支持带外挂字幕的视频，大家感兴趣也可以使用。

现实中的快捷指令
虽然当前快捷指令还不够优秀，但对于日常效率的提升还是有一定帮助的，特别是对于实现与苹果自带应用的互通。
举个使用的例子，每天早上我会用笔记软件记录一下昨日回顾、思考以及今日的计划，对于今日计划，我希望用待办应用去跟踪计划中事项的状态，但是手动把写过的东西在另一个APP里面再写一遍实在是太过愚蠢，于是我就写了快捷指令去实现。

实际使用中，只要选择对应的文本并在共享表单中点击对应的操作就可以同步到系统自带的提醒事项中，在mac上还可以添加快捷键一键实现（应该还可以通过「自动化」省去手动操作这一步）。
当前的快捷指令有三个亮点：

在快捷指令的编辑上采用图形化拖拽操作，相对于写脚本，这种操作显得更加友好，并且也可以支持自定义脚本的加入，甚至让我一度觉得学编程的第一个应用是用快捷指令写得；
在快捷指令的运行上打通了Siri、小组件以及共享操作，特别是后者，为与三方应用的结合提供了基础的平台；
加入了自动化功能，可以根据一定的规则直接省去了用户主动调用快捷指令这一步。

但要让更多的人在更多场景下使用快捷指令，还有着一些明显的不足：

上手使用上有一些门槛，官方没有详细的教程，虽然提供了一些案例，但是大多数人应该没有耐心仔细去看快捷中心中那些精选的指令是如何实现的，这点Mac上快捷指令前辈「自动操作」可能给点其启示，其中「录制」功能可以通过「我做给你看」自动识别操作中的事件；
快捷指令的分发做得还不够，既然不是每个人都能轻松使用快捷指令，那么获取现成的快捷指令则更加重要，但快捷指令中心中精选的指令本土化、个性化做得并不好，我觉得如果能根据用户所安装的APP来个性化分发常用的快捷指令会更友好；
三方应用的能力开放明显不足，大多数的使用场景还是围绕在苹果自带应用提供的能力，这点极大限制了快捷指令的应用场景；
使用Siri来激活快捷指令时对于指令的识别非常差，官方有说使用快捷指令的名称就可以通过Siri调用，但实际使用时不时语音识别不出来就是调用的指令不正确；

有趣的是，在WWDC2022中，我们看到苹果开始推广App Intent框架，通过为应用开发者提供更多系统级的入口曝光来吸引他们将其应用所能满足的用户意图曝光给系统，从而使得系统可以通过学习用户行为实现跨应用的能力整合。
结语
很多人即使生活中充满重复的事情也不会去探索提高效率方式，因为对比眼前简单的操作，去探究增进效率操作的所花费的学习努力带来的成本更加高，只是把时间线拉得足够远，才能看见效率提升所带来收益。
自动化所存在的意义是帮助人完成任务并节省时间，虽然我们每个人都已经拥有足够多的计算设备，但我们并没有充分发挥其拥有的算力，个人的自动化仍是一个尚待开发的领域。
期待未来的快捷指令能为个人的自动化增添更多的可能性。</span>

                              <span>记账是我坚持得最久的习惯，到如今已经快4年。
期间有中断过，怀疑过，也尝试过很多不同的工具，发现用对工具的确轻松很多，也更容易坚持。今天就来跟大家分享下我记账这些年的心路历程，希望能帮到正在犹豫记账的你。
我会先讲下我是如何坚持记账，以及记账对我的改变，最后再分享记账应用（附带视频），只想看评测的话可以直接跳到最后哦。
一、如何开始记账
我之所以开始记账，也是因为发现自己每个月钱都不知花哪去了，所以想通过记账来了解自己的收支情况，让自己对生活掌控得更好。
一开始是消费一单就记一次，但太繁琐了，经常会忘记。所以就改成了每天固定睡前记账。但这样，依旧老是忘记，于是我设置了每晚10点的定时闹钟，效果就好很多了。等到养成习惯后，就再也不用设置闹钟了，以后一到那个点，脑子就自动提醒我记账，偶有遗忘，但也慢慢坚持下来了。而且因为我用打卡app，所以如果没记账，那天的记录就会为空，出于强迫症的原因，我也一定会把缺的那天补上。就这么不知不觉坚持了快4年。
但其实，我这种每一笔都记的方式还是比较费劲的，不一定适合所有人，我这里推荐两个降低难度的方式：

别全部都都记，这样太琐碎，而是设置一个额度，高于该额度的支出才记。
是充分利用记账应用，选择有自动同步账单功能，或者支持语音输入的记账应用，下面有推荐类似的App。

二、对记账的反思
那我这样记账4年下来的结果如何呢？
一方面，我的确因此免去了许多不必要的开支，存住了钱，对比起身边一些朋友，有储蓄更踏实，还可以把闲钱拿出来投资理财。
但另一方面，我也明显感觉自己似乎有点 落伍了......当同龄人在炫耀新买的电子产品、潮牌、口红包包时，当别人用钱堆出来一个时髦大方的形象时，其实很难不羡慕。可是让我去购买一些非必需品，这带来的罪恶感，又远大于我得到它的满足感。

是的，记账的习惯，让我的消费习惯变成了——只买有用的东西。

瑞典时间 10 月 4 日上午，诺贝尔奖委员会宣布 2022 年诺贝尔物理学奖授予阿兰·阿斯佩克特 (Alain Aspect)、约翰·克劳瑟 (John F. Clauser) 和安东·泽林格 (Anton Zeilinger)，以表彰他们 「进行了纠缠光子的实验，确立了对贝尔不等式的不成立并开创了量子信息科学」。阿兰·阿斯佩克特、约翰·克劳瑟和安东·泽林格分别利用处于相互纠缠的量子态进行了突破性的实验。在这种情况下，两个粒子即使被分开也表现得如同一个整体。他们的成果为基于量子信息的新技术扫清了道路。
—— 摘自诺贝尔物理学奖官方新闻稿

说实话，在诺贝尔奖委员会正式宣布量子纠缠相关的成果获奖后，我立刻就意识到，互联网上很快就会充斥着各种针对量子纠缠以及量子世界的神秘性相关的科普。这些科普，无论是原创的还是东拼西凑的，无论是专家学者起草的还是各路内容流水线上生产的，都有一个共同的特征：它们往往都喜欢强化量子物理的神秘性和不可理解。
我承认，历史上确实有这么一段时间，即使是 20 世纪初期那些鼎鼎大名的物理学家，都曾为量子相关的物理现象感到困惑。然而，经过一百多年的发展，量子物理的诸多核心概念早就被一代又一代的物理学家里里外外地玩了个遍，以至于许多被科普作家渲染得神乎其神的概念，现正躺在物理系本科生的必修课教材里。
当然，量子力学有它反直觉的地方。但是，现实生活中反直觉的事情还少吗？反直觉并不意味着神秘或不可理解。它只是需要你屏蔽你的许多生活常识，用绝对的理性来思考问题。所以，这篇文章会和你读过的绝大部分科普不同，我不会把量子…</span>

                              <span>引言：用惯旗舰的我，为啥突然自购了一台入门DAP？

我承认，这个标题有点蹭过时热搜的标题党嫌疑；但作为一个有着五六年HiFi设备购买经验、分享却极其佛系的用户，收获不能说是经验丰富吧，至少也能说是白忙一场；自从三年以前第一次入手了旗舰级的KANN CUBE之后，为了追求“好马配好鞍”，在便携领域各种入手搭配的旗舰耳塞线材套装，洒出去的钱也有个五位数往上了。虽然标题上写着是对节奏坦克新款播放器V6的体验，但从某种程度上来说，这篇文章也算是玩了这么久的HiFi设备之后，一篇简单的自我回顾和反思文章。
在半个月前，我绝对不可能相信听惯了“旗舰级DAP”的自己会甘于使用一台中低端价位的播放器，即便中低端播放器近年来也的确出现过不少声音表现优秀、拉动价位甚至行业疯狂内卷的机器，但高端播放器毕竟有自己的能力与气场：作为品牌的旗舰，一般都有着最好的用料、最新的功能配置、最前沿的DAC芯片——著名的Astell&amp;Kern甚至没事就和上游的旭化成深度合作，三代SP系列几乎成为AKM全新旗舰DAC的首发平台；同时也倾注着品牌最优秀的音乐理解。
很显然，这些资源优势都是一般中低端播放器很难获得的，所以我现在依旧不怀疑“正经厂牌的高端播放器在综合素质表现上必然优于中低端产品”；以上观点也不代表我认为“所有人都必须和我一样不买个几万块东西就别想快乐听歌”，如果你的天桥9.9耳机已经让你非常快乐，那太好了，什么设备都理应有快乐听歌的权利。我开始怀疑的是，每天没事盯着见底的工资卡、紧了吧唧的盘算着怎么搭配耳机播放器，导致我个人的生活多了一堆需要计较的大小事，这些真的能让我听歌的过程变得更“快乐”吗？

因此这半个月的时间刚好给了我一个机会，你也可以认为这种机会比较祸福相依：我自购的SP1000在半个月前，因为某些极其离谱的外部非质量原因，不慎导致2.5mm接口损坏，被迫返厂维修。设备虽然要修，歌却不能…</span>

                              <span>痛点
想想看，平时在阅读上，你做了多少无用功？
勤勤恳恳阅读，认认真真做好高亮批注。你看到自己的思考结果与文章或者书中的文字融于一体，觉得特别安心。
然而，当你需要整理或者调用这些笔记的时候，才发现它们如同断线的珠子，散落在各种地方：
RSS 阅读内容在 feedspot 里； 微信公众号的高亮在 Instapaper 里；Epub 标记在 Marginnote 里；PDF 的高亮和批注在 LiquidText 里面…… 如果不加整理，它们就会在不同的应用中终老。
问题来了，该怎么整理这些散落的阅读笔记？
有的人并不觉得这是个棘手的事情。他们的作息时间，如同钟表一般规律。可以做到每天晚上专门花时间，雷打不动把这些内容整理出来，做好分类，放在 Evernote 或者 Obsidian 里。
但是，这种方法，对于懒人显然不友好。至少我自己，就笃定无法日复一日坚持下去。即便我希望能持续一周这样操作，恐怕都得专门雇个人在旁边监督自己。
幸好，技术的进步使我们不用活得那么悲摧。有一些工具可以帮助我们汇集各种资料，尤其是帮你保管阅读记录和高亮、批注。更好的消息，是这些工具有很多，例如 Readwise, Matter, Diigo, Cubox 和简悦（Simpread）等。
本文我就以自己常用的 Readwise 为例，为你介绍如何自动化汇集整理和利用笔记。希望这些经验也能够帮到你，早日摆脱手动整理阅读笔记的困扰。

                              <span>iA Writer 是一款非常著名的，以简洁优美的界面和不错的使用体验著称的 Markdown 写作软件（虽然我没用过）。而最近，iA Writer 的开发商 iA.net 发布了一款名为 iA Presenter 的幻灯片制作软件，旨在通过简单的 Markdown 创作出精美的幻灯片。
市面上制作幻灯片的软件已经是数不胜数，除了常见的 PowerPoint、Keynote，还有基于 HTML5 技术的 Prezi、reveal.js、Canva 等，基于文档生成幻灯片的软件也有不少，比如双链笔记软件 Obsidian、文档工具语雀、飞书文档、石墨文档都有演示模式。
在这么多软件之中，iA Presenter 又有哪些优势，值得我们从繁杂的工作中抬起头来呢。
首先说明一下，目前 iA Presenter 还处于一个非常早期的阶段，文中提到的一些内容随时可能会因为软件的版本更新而发生变更。
另外，下文中会将 iA Presenter 简称为 iA Pre。
在此，也感谢 @南山居氪 提供的 iA Presenter 的邀请码。
PowerPoint 发生了什么
似乎现在很多软件都在以一种革命性的姿态来发布——认为自己的诞生能够颠覆一个行业，至少在发布时会伴随着一些阐述自己设计哲学的文章。Roam 和 Arc 是如此，iA Pre 也有些这样的味道。
iA 在其新闻页面上发了两篇文章，主要在说 PowerPoint 等传统幻灯片工具有什么问题，和 iA Pre 怎样使幻灯片更好？。
在第一篇文章1中，iA 认为，以 PPT 为代表的传统幻灯片工具有着入门难、耗时长、会让演讲者忘记他想说的东西、以及搭配 PPT 的演讲大多很无聊，这种无聊是我们的职业杀手以及事业杀手。
iA 怎样使幻灯片更好？
而在第二篇文章2中，iA 提出了他们认为的让演讲和幻灯片制作变得更好的方法：

                              <span>很多人会把人生比喻为游戏，因为都需要在既定的规则下，和他人同台竞争谋求最大胜利，读书时的升学排名，就业后岗位的激烈竞争，无一不是要决出个胜负，每个人都要追求赢。
但我们可能从来没有想过，除了参加有输赢的游戏，其实我们还可以选择另一种游戏——没有输赢，可以持续玩下去的游戏。
这便是《有限与无限的游戏》中的观点，它认为世界上至少有有限和无限两种游戏，有限游戏以获胜为目的，无限游戏以延续游戏为目的。
很神奇的是，我之前从《游戏改变世界》这本书中首次知晓该理论时，只是觉得有意思，但对我并没什么启发。

可是真的当我自己看完这本20万字的小书后，对我的影响却是立竿见影的。我读完隔天，在工作上和同事发生冲突时，脑子里一直在想着“不行，我不能像对方一样发火，我要玩的是无限游戏，争一时的输赢的玩不下去了”，因此就忍住了火气，最终也顺利解决了问题。
所以呢今天也为大家推荐这本书，看完后你一定会觉得，哇，原来有些竞争是根本没必要投入的，原来选择还可以有这么多，生活的改变从心态的改变开始，相信你也可以和我一样豁然开朗！
不过该书其实是本哲学书，理解和解读起来有一定难度，而且写法更偏意识流，作者没有特意去构建严密的框架和推理，甚至全书中作者自己都没有直接发表过「无限游戏更好」的结论，所以我会加入个人的理解去解读以便更好地介绍，但我也只是抛砖引玉，建议大家过后去看全书。
一、有限与无限游戏的基本概念
有限游戏有三个显著特征。

它是以取胜为目的，一旦决出胜负则游戏结束，所以称之为有限游戏，注意这里的胜负必须是所有参与者认同，而不是裁判或观众认同。
参与者只能在游戏界限内进行游戏。
