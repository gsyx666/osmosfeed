                              <span>Hi, anyone knows if it&#x27;s possible yo connect multiple social accounts ( YouTube,twitter, Facebook...) To the same user account when they have different emails?
Example: I have a user that signs up with email and password, after that he can connect his social accounts ( not for login, but to post stuff on them via my app ) but the catch is, the accounts may have different emails, and as i see not all auth providers support linking multiple accounts woth different emails, and the ones that do, do that for login only.
So my question is , how do i do it? Should i save the users accounts on a database after they login, so when he logins on the app the next time, i will fetch all his accounts from my account and display them?!</span>

This little issue that appears in every single project where users can register themselves that says &quot;Implement the forgot password feature&quot; 😅
It&#x27;s so common than most of the time people even doesn&#x27;t split the issue. But should we?
Well, let&#x27;s check the nuances on that.

Show a message with a &quot;forgot password?&quot; link/button whenever the user fails to log in.
Ask the server to send the &quot;forgot password email&quot;.
Catch the request on the server.
Generate a token on the fly
Generate a Link that includes this token
Inject this link into an email template
Send the email with the template
When the link is clicked, we need to validate the token
If it&#x27;s expired, redirect to the login, showing the &quot;forgot password?&quot; link/button again along with a message…</span>

                              <span>In my last article about the analog clock I showed how I built it. The seconds hand is just jumping from second to second but I wanted to have it move smoothly.
The code for the seconds hand:
const Seconds &#x3D; styled(Hours).attrs(({ time }) &#x3D;&gt; ({
  style: { transform: &#x60;rotateZ(${time.getSeconds() * 6}deg)&#x60; },
}))&#x60;
  background-color: red;
  height: 50px;
  left: calc(50% - 0.5px);
  top: 5px;
  width: 1px;
&#x60;

My immediate thought was to simply add transition: transform 1s linear; to the css.
const Seconds &#x3D; styled(Hours).attrs(({ time }) &#x3D;&gt; ({
  style: { transform: &#x60;rotateZ(${time.getSeconds() * 6}deg)&#x60; },
}))&#x60;

I wouldn’t say the journey had no bumps across all levels (engineering, marketing, product). Still, I believe that what we achieved from the technical and customer satisfaction standpoints was quite impressive. 
I think half of our success was in knowing how to design systems and implement practices, understanding when and who we should hire, and quickly adapting to the market (that, during the pandemic, changed by the day). 
The other half of our success is in using technology where we could, automating tedious processes, and finding tools that would help us make the most out of human resources.

Hi everyone! In this post we&#x27;ll learn how we can create a card with Tailwind CSS.
You can refer to this to setup tailwind css and code with me(I&#x27;m not so good in making videos)
Before starting to code we should have an idea about what we have to create and how it will look when completed. So, basically a card have an Image, title, some description and a button.
So, first of all structure our Card

The term &quot;self-taught&quot; developer is frequently used to refer to people who have studied coding/programming on their own by reading books, taking online classes and doing other kinds of independent study. Since you are not being forced/required to take lessons by a teacher or educational system, this can be an excellent approach to learn how to program because it gives people the freedom—and flexibility—to concentrate on learning methods that suit them best. Self-taught developers can build their skills by using a variety of methods other than simply reading books or watching internet/youtube videos. We&#x27;ll explore nine different techniques—hacks, tips and tricks inspired by real life experiences—in this article!
The first hack is to start each day with a plan. This can be as …</span>

                              <span>Now that we have our Browser extension up and running with Tailwind CSS and Parcel let&#x27;s look at how we can make it more interactive.
You can choose any framework you are familiar with. I decided to go with React for this one.
The idea is to add React to have an interactive new tab browser extension.

Note: if you want to follow along, use the following GitHub branch.
First, we must let our project know we plan to use React, so let&#x27;s install the needed dependencies.
npm i react react-dom

Then you can go ahead and create an src folder. It will become the central place of our React application.
Now that we have everything installed, those two are the only ones we need 🤯.
We can go ahead and render the React app.

So, I guess you have an idea now what I am going to do. So let&#x27;s jump right into it.

Now you have seen what it looks like. let&#x27;s make it.

    

    

    



The National flag of India is a horizontal tricolor of deep saffron (Kesari) at the top, white in the middle, and dark green at the bottom in equal proportion.
I have created a parent or wrapper class .flag. It has three divs representing each horizontal section of the flag.

Technologies like containers have become common to ensure consistency with various deployments and avoid problems. Amazon Web Services also offers containers that work with cloud infrastructure. 
With three specific cloud services, AWS allows you to execute containerized apps. Amazon Fargate, Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and Elastic Container Service (ECS) are the three major AWS container services. 
In this article, we’ll explain AWS containers and discuss the three AWS container services.

I recently reviewed various reasons why the built-in golang error is not great. In fact, if you Google &quot;golang error handling&quot; you will find many other blogs with various takes on how to navigate errors in golang. Even though the topic has seen lots of conversation, there really has not been much progress.
So I will throw out yet another blog post on golang error handling.
First thing I will propose, though controversial, is to throw out everything there is about golang errors. Do not use error. Do not use the &quot;errors&quot; package. Just throw it all away (it was probably just giving you anxiety anyway). error was more like a guideline anyway.
Now that we have no error handling we are open to a new world of possibilities. What does an error look like? What …</span>

                              <span>What is Image optimization?
The goal of image optimization is to create high-quality images with the lowest file size without lossing quality. It&#x27;s the process of minimizing web page load time without losing significant quality by putting images into right size, dimension, resolution and format. 
Why do we need to optimize image?
To improved page load times.
For better browsing experience.
To improved SEO.
How to optimize image?
Resize your images - use crop size image instead of original image
Use lazy loading
Compress image using commandline tool (convert / jpegoptim) or online tool - https://tinyjpg.com/ 
Use content delivery network like cloudflare, Amazon CloudFront etc
Enable gzip compression on server</span>

Last year in June, we came to you with Rocketlane, a purpose-built customer onboarding platform made for CS, Onboarding, and Implementation teams to help them:
 ⏰ Shorten time-to-value
💪 Hit project goals consistently
🤩 Deliver a 5-star customer experience

In the last 13 months, we’ve shipped a ton of features including templates, automated status updates, and built-in time tracking, to name a few. Our clientele includes the likes of Mixmax, Mosaic, Chargebee, Yellow.ai, Delhivery, and parcelLab and we are now a leader in Client Onboarding on G2.

According to a study by Mckinsey, 70% of digital transformation projects fail and poor resource management is one of top reasons. Rocketlane aims to fix that! We’re
thrilled to announce the launch of Resource Management. The module helps leaders with staffing and planning, and gives them visibility into the team&#x27;s workload which is critical for projects with longer implementation cycles.

The key areas that this module will help you with are:

➕ Workload balancing: Manage your team’s workload in real time. Get a complete picture of everyone’s capacity at a glance, and easily drill down to know additional details.

➕ Resource utilization: See actual vs. budgeted hours and the members allotted to the projects along with the time they are spending on each project.

➕ Demand forecasting: The module intuitively computes the demand, helping teams forecast with accuracy.

➕ Resource planning: Add resource placeholders to templates so next time you create a project all your staffing requirements are automatically accounted for.

We’ve a 14-day trial so give it a spin and share your feedback! Link to Rocketlane&#x27;s resource management: https://rocketlane.com/resource-...

We’re also offering a free Customer Onboarding Audit for the PH community. Visit https://maturitymodel.rocketlane... and get custom insights to improve your customer onboarding methodology.

Official Xbox One sales have largely been a mystery, but now Microsoft is finally admitting the obvious: the PS4 outsold the Xbox One — by a lot.
Microsoft stopped reporting its Xbox One sales figures at the beginning of its 2016 financial year, focusing instead on Xbox Live numbers. The change meant we’ve never officially known how well Xbox One was holding up compared to the PS4 after the Xbox One’s troubled launch. Analyst estimates have consistently put Microsoft in third place behind Sony and Nintendo, and now documents (Word doc) submitted to Brazil’s national competition regulator (spotted by Game Luster) finally shed some light on how the Xbox One generation went. 
“Sony has surpassed Microsoft in terms of console sales and...

据报道，苹果已经在内部测试了苹果地图中的搜索广告，当你搜索餐馆、商店或其他附近的企业时，它可以显示推荐。苹果已经在其应用商店上实施了类似的广告模式，因为开发者可以付费让他们的应用在特定查询的搜索页面上得到推广。苹果的地图，播客和图书等应用目前是无广告的。

电动汽车正在变成订阅制

一家美国加州的初创公司囤积了大量的各种品牌的电动汽车，然后以订阅费的方式提供给客户，除了启动费之外，每月收取 490 至 690 美元，最多可行驶 1000 英里。而另外一方面，宝马公司在英国出售每月 18 美元的座椅加热服务，通用汽车公司则将其安吉星语音服务变成了每辆新的别克、凯迪拉克的 1500 美元的强制订阅。具有讽刺意味的是，即使没有自选附加项目，支撑二手电动汽车价格的主要力量之一是其远程更新的能力，而汽车制造商正在利用同样的技术，通过订阅服务向司机收取费用。


消息来源：BNN



老王点评：如果汽车的主要功能是以软件方式体现的，那么订阅制似乎是有道理的。或许，将来除了汽车，其它的家电、智能房屋都会在一次性购买费用之外，也收取各种功能订阅费用？




2300 万美元：有史以来最大的 YouTube 版税骗局

两位被指控的罪犯成立了一家公司，声称拥有超过 5 万个拉丁音乐歌曲和作品的版权。这家欺诈公司制作了一些假文件，以证明其声称的音乐的所有权。他们通过一家第三方公司合作，该公司可以进入 YouTube 的 CMS 和内容 ID 工具，并帮助艺术家管理他们的数字版权。四年来，这家欺诈公司通过这种手段骗到了 2300 万美元，直到被美国国税局的调查后起诉。

两位点评：保护版权是好的，但是这种宣称版权而欺诈的，可不只是音乐方面。</span>

                              <span>Kali Linux 2022.3 在引入了新的 VirtualBox 镜像格式的同时，也使测试变得更加方便。不要忘了试试新的工具！




Kali Linux 在 2022 年的第三次升级中带着激动人心的新内容回来了。

像往常一样，你可以期待新的工具和全面的改进。此外，还有一些关键的亮点，包括新的 测试实验室环境 和 VirtualBox 镜像。

在这里，让我给你介绍一下这个版本的细节。

Kali Linux 2022.3 有什么新内容？

Kali Linux 2022.3 的发布标志着他们开始启用了 新的 Discord 服务器，使社区能够聚集在一起，谈论关于 Kali Linux 的事情。

除了社区有了 Discord 服务器之外，应该引起你对升级的关注的事情包括：


一个便于测试的新测试实验室环境

开放 kali-tools 资源库，以供社区提交

NetHunter 商店中的新软件

一个新的 VirtualBox 镜像格式

大量的新工具


测试实验室环境

Kali Linux 是为安全研究人员量身定做的，可以用于测试和学习。但是，为了增强体验，使任何人都能毫不费力地建立一个测试实验室，Kali Linux 现在增加了易于安装的软件包，如 DVWA 和 Juice Shop。

开发者还提到，在不久的将来会有更多的软件包。

新工具

新的升级包括了五个有趣的工具，它们是：


BruteShark（网络分析工具）

DefectDojo（开源的应用程序漏洞工具）

phpsploit（隐蔽的破解后应用框架）

shellfire（利用命令注入漏洞）

SprayingToolkit（密码攻击）


你可以探索这些工具以了解更多信息。

增强的 VirtualBox 支持

虽然 Kali Linux 已经可以用于 VMware 和 VirtualBox，但现在为 VirtualBox 用户提供了一种新的镜像格式。

你现在可以下载用于 VirtualBox 的 VDI 磁盘镜像和 .vbox 元数据文件。它是原生的 VirtualBox 镜像格式，具有更好的压缩率，下载速度更快。

对于希望使用最新和最先进工具的用户，Kali Linux 提供了按周构建的虚拟机镜像，构建自其滚动分支。

此外，如果你需要构建你的自定义虚拟机镜像，Kali Linux 已经在 GitLab 上提供了一些脚本。

                              <span>通过使用这个简单而强大的 Linux 命令行工具，来安排备份、文件清理以及其他任务。




在计算机上让任务按照有规律并且可预测的时间表运行很重要。作为人类，我们有时会因为分心、脑子里想太多，或是度假而记不住要做的事情。计算机真的很擅长按计划做事，但在计算机采取行动之前，人类必须对计算机进行编程。

在某种程度上，cron 系统是编程的初级简单入门。通过编辑一个文件就可以让计算机做你想让它做的事。你甚至不需要知道文件保存在哪里。只需键入一个简单的命令，输入你希望电脑遵循的 “配方”，并保存。从那时起，计算机会在指定时间执行你的指令，直到被告知停止。

从设计上来看，cron 不是一个复杂的系统。这里有一些你需要了解的内容。

cron 是什么？

cron 命令在 Linux 和 Unix 中无处不在，而且它经常被模仿和重塑，以至于它几乎成了按计划发生的事情的一个通用术语。它是自动化的一种形式，尽管有不同的实现方式（比如 Dillon&#x27;s cron、Vixie&#x27;s cron、chrony 和其他），以及像 anacron 和 systemd 定时器这样的变化，但其语法和工作流程几十年来一直保持着基本一致。

cron 在一个 “假脱机spool” 系统上工作，像打印机和电子邮件一样。如果不你知道打印机和电子邮件使用假脱机也没关系，因为假脱机文件的意义在于，你不需要想太多。在 Linux 系统中，/var/spool 目录被设计为重要但低级的文件的中心枢纽，用户不需要直接与之交互。 在 /var/spool 中管理的一个假脱机是 cron 表（简称为 “crontab”）。 包括你在内的每个用户在 Linux 系统中都有一个 crontab。用户可以编辑、查看和删除自己的 crontab。除此之外，用户可以使用 crontab 来安排任务。cron 系统监控…</span>

I&#x27;m a happy user of the XML-based Docbook markup language. To me, it&#x27;s a precise, explicit, and detailed system that allows me to have contextual and domain-specific metadata in what I write. Best of all, though, it can be transformed (that&#x27;s what XML users call it when XML is converted into another format) into nearly any format, including HTML, EPUB, FO for PDF, plain text, and more. With great power comes a lot of typing, though, and sometimes Docbook feels like it&#x27;s surplus to requirements. Luckily, there&#x27;s Asciidoc, a system of writing plain text with the same markup-less feel of Markdown, but that transforms to Docbook to take advantage of its precision and flexibility.

Word processing files used to be closed, proprietary formats. In some older word processors, the document file was essentially a memory dump from the word processor. While this made for faster loading of the document into the word processor, it also made the document file format an opaque mess.
Around 2005, the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) group defined an open format for office documents of all types, the Open Document Format for Office Applications (ODF). You may also see ODF referred to as simply &quot;OpenDocument Format&quot; because it is an open standard based on the OpenOffice.org&#x27;s XML file specification. ODF includes several file types,…</span>

                              <span>某日在盗版网站上津津有味的看着《盗墓笔记重启之极海听雷》，翻着翻着，下一章文风突变，变成了《美艳总裁老婆的废柴入赘老公在家族聚会上送礼》的小故事，一时没把持住，看了600多章。我心想我阅读速度也不慢啊，咋感觉剧情进展这么慢，扫了一眼目录当场石化，好家伙，这文你都能水成2200章，真是要顶礼膜拜了。抽了自己几个大嘴巴以后，想了想还是总结一下为啥爽文是如此的让人无法自拔。咱今日不谈网络文学的好坏，就来聊聊这个「爽」。
爽感的对比
首先要自爆家底，这么多年「良好的阅读习惯」让我有幸接触了《斗破苍穹》、《武动乾坤》、《全职法师》、《牧龙师》、《七界传说》、《星辰变》、《盘龙》、《诛仙》、《盗墓笔记》、《鬼吹灯》等，应该也算是见证过当年网文的盛况，自认为对这一类型文有一定的发言权。
传统文学的爽感体验是以一种循序渐进的方式，缓慢而合理的推进剧情，不断累积读者的情绪和体验，最后在结局中以狂风暴雨般的方式宣泄出来。传统题材的小说也不会特意照顾读者感受，不会去刻意迎合读者口味。而网络爽文使用了一种截然不同的方式，彻底以读者为中心进行创作。读者爱看什么，作者就写什么，其目的只有一个：让读者看的爽。至此，网络文学凭借直白的叙事，通俗的文字，连绵不绝的爽快阅读体验，终于成为了文学作品中不可小觑的一种类型。
如果我们以阅读的进度作为x轴，将「爽」值作为Y轴，按照个人体验我画一张如下的图表（黄色为爽文，绿色为传统文学）。

画的比较抽象还望理解，既然要探究为什么爽文的爽会呈现出类似波浪线的形态，令人爽的额难以自拔，可能得先从爽文的代入感说起。
爽感的地基：代入感
所谓代入，即读者以移情的方式，将自身转移到主角身上，从而间接获得主角的世界，以及在剧情推进中获得的各类体验。之所以强调代入感，就好比你隔壁是个富二代，你每天看着人家香车美女的生活必然只会觉得不爽，因为你跟他的生活毫无交集，他的爽你根本无法感…</span>

本文参与数字文具盒征文活动。

少数派一直是高效率人士最爱的分享平台之一，我也喜欢在工作的闲暇之余学习别人的效率技巧，或者是体验新出的效率 app，也逐渐形成了自己的一套科研工作流。最近浏览少数派中数字文具盒的征文，很多同学的学习方法我都非常认可，并且能够在我的科研生活中找到相似的影子。想来也是该总结总结我三年的经验了，既是反思自己这些年的工作流是否合理，也可借此机会和大家分享讨论何为有效的「学术生活」。
作为一个普通双一流的土博，毕业的主要条件是论文，所以这三年来我的主要工作便是尽可能地多产出成果。但是在此之前，我是没有接受过系统化的科研训练的，并且为了匹配导师团队的研究方向，我几乎是从零开始学习相关知识，笔记的重要性日渐凸显。经过1年多的探索和自我怀疑（以及摸鱼混日子），我终于在博二开始有了一点点产出，在国内的学术会议上口头汇报自己的工作，自此之后，论文对我来说也不再是遥不可及的高峰。当然这离不开导师的悉心指导与团队的帮助，但是我自以为我的工作流帮助并加速了成果产出，不至于即将毕业的我简历还是一片空白。
那么我就从知识的输入、沉淀与输出来谈谈我的学术工作流吧，其中绝大多数方法并不是只有科研工作者才能使用，我相信，只要是喜欢学习的人，整理知识的目的一定是殊途同归的。希望接下来的内容能够给大家带来一点点启发。
知识的输入

1. 接口存在的意义？
在 Dart 中 接口 定义并没有对应的关键字。可能有些人觉得 Dart 中弱化了 接口 的概念，其实不然。我们一般对接口的理解是：接口是更高级别的抽象，接口中的方法都是 抽象方法 ，没有方法体。通过接口的定义，我们可以通过定义接口来声明功能，通过实现接口来确保某类拥有这些功能。
不过你有没有仔细想过，为什么接口会存在，引入接口的概念是为了解决什么问题？可能有人会说，通过接口，可以规范一类事物的功能，可以面向接口进行操作，从而可以更加灵活地进行拓展。其实这只是接口的作用，而且这些功能 抽象类 也可以支持。所以接口一定存在什么特殊的功能，是抽象类无法做到的。
都是抽象方法的抽象类，和接口有什么本质的区别呢？在我的初入编程时，这个问题就伴随着我，但渐渐地，这个问题好像对编程没有什么影响，也就被遗忘了。网上很多文章介绍 抽象类 和 接口 的区别，只是在说些无关痛痒的形式区别，并不能让我觉得接口存在有什么必要性。
思考一件事物存在的本质意义，可以从没有这个事物会产生什么后果来分析。现在想一下，如果没有接口，一切的抽象行为仅靠 抽象类 完成会有什么局限性 或说 弊端。没有接口，就没有  实现 (implements)  的概念，其实这就等价于在问 implements 消失了，对编程有什么影响。没有实现，类之间就只能通过 继承 (extends) 来维护 is-a 的关系。所以就等价于在问 extends 有什么局限性 或说 弊端。答案呼之欲出：多继承的二义性 。
那问题来了，为什么类不能支持 多继承 ，而接口可以支持 多实现 ，继承 和 实现 有什么本质的区别呢？为什么 实现 不会带来 二义性 的问题，这是理解接口存在关键。

Zoom has issued a patch for a bug on macOS that could allow a hacker to take control of a user’s operating system (via MacRumors). In an update on its security bulletin, Zoom acknowledges the issue (CVE-2022-28756) and says a fix is included in version 5.11.5 of the app on Mac, which you can (and should) download now.
Patrick Wardle, a security researcher and founder of the Objective-See Foundation, a nonprofit that creates open-source macOS security tools, first uncovered the flaw and presented it at the Def Con hacking conference last week. My colleague, Corin Faife, attended the event and reported on Wardle’s findings. 


As Corin explains, the exploit targets the Zoom installer, which requires special user permissions to run. By...

Reddit now lets users purchase Ethereum cryptocurrency on the platform through an integration with FTX, the crypto exchange owned by billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried. In a press release, FTX announced that Reddit users can now use the firm’s payment system, FTX Pay, when managing their blockchain-based community points.
Reddit first rolled out community points in 2020 as a way to reward users for interacting with a community. These points exist on the Ethereum blockchain and are stored in the “Vault,” a user’s blockchain-based wallet that also holds the collectible NFT (non-fungible token) avatars that Reddit introduced last month.
Reddit displays a user’s community points next to their username as a measure of their reputation, but also...

Apple could eventually bring ads to more of the apps that come pre-installed on your iPhone and other Apple devices, including Maps, Books, and Podcasts. According to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple has internally tested search ads in Maps, which could display recommendations when you search for restaurants, stores, or other nearby businesses. 
Apple already implements a similar advertising model on the App Store, as developers can pay to have their app promoted on a search page for a particular query, like “puzzle games” or “photo editor.” As noted by Gurman, ads on Maps could work in the same way, with businesses paying to appear at the top of search results when users enter certain search terms.
Gurman believes that Apple...

Moments after booting up Halo: Combat Evolved with some friends, stepping onto the legendary Blood Gulch map, and dying nearly instantly from a few well-placed pistol shots, I remembered exactly why wires are good. 
When my friends brought two original Xbox consoles along for a beach weekend, I expected that there would be some hassle getting them to work for our planned six-player matches. The game and consoles are more than 20 years old, likely predating even the dusty flat-screen TVs we were playing on. But to my surprise, just a few minutes after we had set up the consoles and connected them for system link play, we plugged in some controllers, made a Halo lobby, and began trash talking each other across the entire house.

根据 TIOBE 指数 8 月份榜单，Python 的“市场份额”在本月又上升了 2%，达到 15.42% 的历史最高水平。自去年 10 月 Python 首次夺得该指数第一的位置以来，已经过去了 10 个月，成为除 Java 和 C 之外唯一保持能第一位置的语言。现在很难找到一个 Python 没有被广泛使用的编程领域。唯一的例外是嵌入式系统，因为 Python 是动态类型的，速度太慢。8 月榜单的前三名是：Python（15.42%）、C（14.59%）、Java（12.40%）。

针对星链终端的攻击已经开始了

自 2018 年以来，星链已经发射了 3000 多颗小卫星进入轨道，还有数千颗卫星计划发射。安全研究人员创建了一个可以连接到星链终端天线上的定制黑客工具，使用的是现成的零件，成本约为 25 美元。它能够暂时短路系统，以帮助绕过星链的安全保护措施，进入星链系统中先前被锁定的部分。虽然星链已经发布了一个更新，以增加攻击的难度，但除非该公司创建一个新版本的主芯片，否则根本问题无法修复。安全研究人员说，所有现有的用户终端都很脆弱。

微软在 2021 年度的漏洞赏金支付上超过了谷歌

从 2021 年 7 月 1 日开始，到 2022 年 6 月 30 日，微软为 335 名研究人员颁发了 1370 万美元的奖励。而谷歌在 2021 年“破纪录”地奖励了 870 万美元。微软今年做了一些改变，为其 Office 365 产品线中出现的高影响漏洞多支付了高达 26,000 美元，其他奖项则增加了 30%。而 另外一方面，谷歌在 Linux 安全方面投入了更多的资金，毕竟现在谷歌几乎所有产品都是基于 Linux 的。

                              <span>如果你更喜欢用终端与系统交互，请了解一下我最喜欢的管理文件的命令。




在如 GNOME 或 KDE 等图形桌面中使用鼠标点击管理文件。你点击文件的图标，将它移动到另一个文件夹中，或者移动到回收站里。图形交互使得桌面计算机便于使用。

但是在 Linux 中，我们并不总是与图形界面交互。如果你在服务器上工作，那么你可能需要使用命令行来解决问题。即使像我这样使用桌面的用户，可能也更喜欢使用终端和命令行和系统交互。我倾向于通过命令行运行命令来管理我的文件：

使用 ls 显示文件

ls


对任何使用命令行的人来说，如果不知道有什么文件，工作将很难进行下去。ls 命令 会罗列出文件夹中的文件。例如，要查看 Web 服务器的文档根目录 /var/www/html 中的内容，你可以键入：

ls /var/www/html


大多数情况，我使用 ls 命令查看当前文件夹内的文件。只需要输入 ls 即可查看所有文件。例如，当我在我的网页项目的根目录时，输入 ls 后可以看到这些：

$ ls
about  fontawesome      fonts   index.php  styles
docs   fontawesome.zip  images  prism


ls 命令包含 60 种选项，可以以任意方式显示文件和目录。-l 是一个很有用的选项，可以详细的显示文件，包含权限、文件大小以及所有者等信息。

$ ls -l

                              <span>不要让文件权限拖你后腿。以下是在 Linux 和 macOS 上管理它们的方法。


如果你通过网络或“跑腿网络”（将文件保存到硬盘，以将其复制到一台计算机）在两个用户之间共享文件，那么在尝试读取或写入文件时可能会遇到权限错误。即使你了解它的概念，你也可能不知道该如何诊断或解决问题。我曾经将数据迁移作为一项服务执行，因此我遇到了相当多的权限错误和所有权冲突。这是我快速修复它们的方法。

1、确定正确的用户

在修复权限错误之前，你必须确定需要权限的人是谁。你可能认为你已经知道这一点，但你可能没有意识到用户名并不是用户身份的最确定属性。你的计算机不会将你视为一个人，而是将你视为一个数字。要了解你的号码，请查看你的用户 ID：

$ id --user
1005


2、获取当前所有者

接下来，确定你无法与之交互的文件的所有者。由于发生了文件权限问题，你可能需要使用 sudo 命令查看有关文件的信息：

$ sudo ls --numeric-uid-gid
-rw------- 1 1000 100  23041 Aug  2 05:26 bar
-rw------- 1 1000 100  54281 Aug  2 04:58 baz
-rw------- 1 1000 100    822 Aug  2 08:19 foo


在此示例中，拥有文件的用户被标识为用户 ID 1000，这就是用户 ID 1005 无法与它们交互的原因。更糟糕的是，这些文件标记为仅由拥有它们的用户可读和可写，因此即使是同一组的成员也不能与这些文件进行交互。

3、更改权限以匹配

你知道需要权限的用户，因此你可以更改当前所有者以匹配你当前的用户：

$ sudo chown 1005 foo


你还可以通过更改文件模式授予你的组成员以及系统上可能的其他用户对文件的访问权限。例如，在向组和任何其他用户授予读取权限（4）的同时保持读取和写入权限（7）：

$ sudo chmod 744 foo


了解更多

当你对文件权限不熟悉时，它们似乎很棘手。有关文件所有权如何工作的更多信息，请阅读 chown 简介。

                              <span>写在前面
30 岁，有人开始发现自己不再年轻，有人开始焦虑自己的目标、成功和失败，30 岁在 20 岁看来也许觉得好笑，在 40 岁看来也许又觉得矫情。不管怎么说，我的 30 岁还是来了。
在我派发这篇文章时，已是我在 30 岁路上的第 5 天，此刻才有时间写点东西。

论写生日小作文，我最佩服《失控》的作者凯文凯利（KK）。68 岁生日，他写下 68 Bits of Unsolicited Advice，给出了自己 68 岁时的 68 条忠告。69 岁生日，他写下了 99 Additional Bits of Unsolicited Advice，给出了自己 69 岁的 99 条忠告。今年等来了他 70 岁生日主题文 103 Bits of Advice I Wish I Had Known。嚯，这次直接增加到了 103 条。

崇拜谁就模仿谁，所以很早之前我给自己定下过 30 岁写 30 条感悟的目标。嗯，如你所见，没写出来。还是熊言熊语，随便聊聊。

也许
29 岁最后一天和 30 岁第一天的我们不会有多少质的变化。真正让我们成熟的是那些生活和其中为数不多的经历，或让人恍然大悟，或让人追悔莫及，或让人晕头转向，也可能让人继续前行。
有些人 30 岁的经历你可能在 20 岁已经习得，有些人 30 岁的感受你可能要等到 40 岁才有所体会。
许久没联系的发小前几天微信问我作为三旬老汉有何感受。我这个发小本科毕业 7 年时间里先后换了三份工作，英年早婚，孩子已经能打酱油，如今安家在一个南方城市。我猜他不是真心求教，便说：读书读的太久了，才开始感受社会的暴击。
他回复我：很好，那就不用我了，生活能教你做个人。

29 岁这一年，当我拿到一本建行绿色「个人住房抵押贷款合同」，翻开 X00 万贷款还款 30 年那一页时，脑子里突然冒出了万青的一句歌词：如此生活 30 年，直到大厦…</span>

                              <span>虽然裸辞以后收入不能保证，也中断了自己的职业生涯，但是这一年，从每天晚上规划「明天干吗好呢」开始，我发现自己是可以掌控生活的。
我可以决定自己每一天要不要工作、要不要提升自己、要不要追寻快乐，不管做了什么选择，我都不再抱怨，而且珍惜时间。
比起在公司常常不好意思拒绝他人、被kpi追着跑、看不清大局，我在与自己的相处过程中，似乎渐渐明白「为自己的选择负责」，意味着什么。
不断为时间做决策的过程，也是不断地自我验证。
我更清楚自己擅长、缺失、喜爱、抗拒的事物，根据自己的评估，补上了一些所需技能，也放任自己不勉强接受抗拒的东西，让生活状态尽量保持在「心情不错且有收获」的可持续流动中。
最幸运的是，身边的人不会觉得我很奇怪，写稿技能也在市场上获得回馈。
所以以下是给自己的一年期交代～涵盖这一年的时间安排(多图表预警)、转自由职业体悟、生活创作和心境转变，共4300+字，来不及看先收藏或打赏(喂)也行。
 
一、裸辞后的时间都干吗去了？
在去年6月底离职前，我有4年全职工作经验，媒体编辑，大体是个没什么生活的人。
辞职以后，我大致经历了休养→探索→认命→前进四个阶段：

7-10月 休养期
架了个人网站、从0到1启动单口播客、整理生活(相册/收藏夹等)、看书
裸辞前身体较差，给自己的唯一kpi是「全然地休息」，不着急确定下一步

11月-1月 探索期
随着收入渐少，有去面试，但没有想上班的心情，觉得自己可能要主动做点什么
因此找了喜欢的健身领域，每周工作三天，其他几天继续探索不同可能
顺便回家一趟，经历两岸隔离28+14天

2月-3月 认命期
明晰了自己只是不想浪费时间在反复沟通而非工作本身，因此认命接受自由职业
开始拓展自由职业客户来源，或者说让更多人知道我可以做什么

4月-6月 前进期
封控在家两个月，尝试接触更多客户、完成不同稿子


 
从数据上看，收入曲线 (图一) 也…</span>

                              <span>本文参与数字文具盒征文活动。

我是一个在读的社科博士生。大约一年多以前，我正式进入到博士研究的阶段。很快我发现，博士与硕士本科阶段不同，我面临着文章发表的压力却又缺乏充分的导师指导，由此我开始认真思考如何建立自己的知识管理与任务管理系统。感谢少数派上众多热心作者的分享，让我在这一年里了解并尝试了各种各样的笔记工具、任务管理工具以及方法论体系，并成功浪费了大量学习时间。
然而，虽然每次看到喜欢的新工具都会马上下载使用，我却总是难以坚持下来。在经历了无数次的尝试-放弃循环后，我发觉最重要的不是工具本身，而是容纳这些工具的「盒子」——即如何最简单明了地将文件管理、项目管理、知识管理等等工具融合在一起。
但恰恰是这些基础的东西，大部分的分享都没有详细提及，它们可能没有什么技术含量，但却是入门者最最需要的。因此，我想和大家分享一下我是如何将 Mac 桌面作为我的数字文具盒，搭建简易数字化学术工作流程的，或许能对刚开始入门的朋友有所帮助。

首先谈谈一个普遍存在的问题：

为什么我看到某某博主介绍的某款笔记工具非常酷炫，非常符合自己的需求，但是就是用不下去呢？

可能有这几方面的原因：

工具学习成本过高，难以上手。
工具与自己正在使用的工具功能、工作习惯冲突，无法完全融入到自己的工作流中。
自己太懒工具使用需要耗费时间精力，没有养成使用习惯，产生拖延。

就我自己的探索经历来说，这几方面的问题一般共同存在。
举个例子，初次知道 logseq 这个双链笔记应用的时候，我觉得它就是完美的笔记工具，于是马上下载试用，每天在它的 dailynote 里面记录各种各样的东西，包括每日任务、未来计划、会议记录、研究灵感、阅读笔记，项目总结等等，然后用双链加以整理。
但是一段时间后发现，它和之前的工具产生了冲突。比如我的文献 pdf 是用 Zotero 来管理的，这就导致每次查阅文献都要同时打开…</span>

一个个小问题堆出棘手大问题
同学们好，我是 AZ，AZ 是我。作为一个在“文理学院”上学、学的是两个本身就是跨专业学科的双专业学生，要学的知识范围实在是广到自己都数不明白的程度。从专业本身的基因和数据科学，到分子生物和计算机、有机化学和统计概率、生物工程和数据伦理，再到学院要求的国际关系、文学写作、历史艺术，有至少一半都是超出我已有的知识框架的内容。这些《乱七八糟》的东西一股脑丢过来，基本上摔在地上的和接住且拿住的五五开。为了自己的学业（aka 绩点），也为了自己越来越重的黑眼圈和越来越秃的脑袋，得想想办法。
AZ 的学习工作流 &amp; 关于工作流的思考
工作流，顾名思义，是一套能胜任一系列需求的「数字文具」使用范式。但作为一个被迫要学文科社科工科计算机还有设计的理科生，似乎没有一套这样的范式能很好的适配所有的学科。作为一个很不喜欢和生态逆行的人，我尝试过但无法适应同时使用过多的平台来做信息的储存和处理，因而在很长的一段时间每当我看到新的软件出现下意识的第一反应都是「我在 Notion 里能怎么实现这个功能」。到现在，我绝大部分的信息，不管是生活相关的、学业相关的、还是课外活动相关的，都有条不紊的排列在我的 Notion 里。
但是回到最开始提到的问题上，虽然我很爱 Notion 觉得 Notion 功能非常的强大也把大量的信息托付给这个平台，不得不承认，Notion 确实不是用来学习的最优解。先别着急反驳！无可否认，写笔记这件事本身 Notion 完全没有问题，可以轻易分列插入公式等特性使我把很多高数、物理、化学这些纯理科以康奈尔笔记的形式丢在了里面。但是但凡对学习这点事有研究的朋友都知道，最能做到长效记忆的学习方式…</span>

2019 年，导演李一凡拍摄了三年的纪录片在广东时代美术馆上映。随后，这部名为《杀马特我爱你》的片子在网上掀起热烈讨论。豆瓣上有影评这样写道：「还没有一部纪录片可以像《杀马特我爱你》让我这么感动，以致于看到中间，我不自觉地拿起手机拼命的记笔记，生怕遗漏掉其中每一段杀马特充满力量的表达，那些关于自由、关于快乐、关于压迫的生命哲学表达。」这部影片也成为印象中「叛逆的、非主流、亚文化」杀马特群体祛魅的代表作。
与之类似的，由 B 站 UP 主衣戈猜想发布的视频作品《二舅》近期也掀起不小的舆论波澜，从立意到故事本身的真伪都饱受讨论。我们不去剥丝抽茧论证事件本身的真实度，但从画风上来看，它在拍摄手法上也使用了田野民族志的方式。
相比已经成为亚文化符号的「杀马特」，类似「二舅」这样传奇又曲折的人格与经历，不曾像如今这般立于舆论场的镁光灯下。无论看完之后会生出怎样的感受：是疼痛、同情、喟叹或哑然、无感、内心矛盾，这都是一场对乡土生活的祛魅的过程。
它背后的传播母题是怎样的？我们又要如何理解「苦难符号」与情感动员之间的关系？一地鸡毛的舆论场冷却之后，比起片子里讲了什么，还有哪些欲语还休的留白更值得讨论？
我们与故事的距离：「影像真实」争议背后的共性价值
7 月末，《二舅》这个 11 分钟的视频在网络上窜火。不到一个礼拜，公众讨论的话题从文案的精妙、背后的社会议题，再到内容本身的真假。从情怀到打假背后，是不断翻新的衍生讨论，不限于精神内耗、乡土风味、非虚构写作的边界等等。
从传播的角度出发，我们首先需要明确的是：作为观众，我们与作品的距离不等于我们与故事本身的距离。我们首先接触到的层面，始终是「影像真实」。
有网友对此评述：二舅的出现的确改变了我一些看待人性生活的方式。一个治愈当下的故事，如果其内核被抽丝剥茧，被现实解读，那么故事便不再是故…</span>

Elon Musk pitched sustainable energy, brain implants, and space exploration in an article published in a Chinese magazine run by the country’s internet watchdog and censorship agency, according to a translation from Yang Liu, a reporter for the Chinese state press agency, Xinhua. (via WSJ reporter Karen Hao).
Formed in 2013, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) is in charge of creating and enforcing policies surrounding online content, user data, and digital security. The CAC later created a magazine that, according to China Media Project senior researcher, Stella Chen, typically includes regulatory announcements and research on internet policy. The magazine was initially called New Media before it was rebranded as China...

Uber is ending its free loyalty program, Uber Rewards, so it can turn its attention to its subscription-based Uber One membership. In an email sent to customers, Uber explains that users can still earn points until the end of August, and that the last day to redeem points is October 31st. 
“Thank you for being part of Uber Rewards,” the email reads. “It’s been a great ride, but we’ve decided to end Rewards soon, as we shift our focus to our new Uber One membership program.”

Uber has since posted an update about the loyalty program’s imminent shutdown, which will take place on November 1st, 2022. Launched in 2018, Uber Rewards is a free...

前言
Bitmap 是 Android 应用的内存占用大户，是最容易造成 OOM 的场景。为此，Google 也在不断尝试优化 Bitmap 的内存分配和回收策略，涉及：Java 堆、Native 堆、硬件等多种分配方案，未来会不会有新的方案呢？
深入理解 Bitmap 的内存模型是有效开展图片内存优化的基础，在这篇文章里，我将深入 Android 6.0 和 Android 8.0 系统源码，为你总结出不同系统版本上的 Bitmap 运行时内存模型，以及 Bitmap 使用的 Native 内存回收兜底策略。 知其然，知其所以然，开干！
这篇文章是 Android UI 开发系列图片专题文章第 6 篇，专题文章列表：

前言
共享内存（shared memory）是最常见的ipc进程之间通讯的方式之一了，很多linux书籍上，都将共享内存评价为“最有用的ipc机制”，就连Binder机制盛行的android体系，同样也离不开共享内存的应用！在所以ipc方式中，共享内存以“快”赢得了很多开发者的掌声，我们下面深入看看！
共享内存相关函数

首先讲到共享内存，那么肯定离不开要介绍几个函数
shmget
int shmget(key_t key, size_t size, int shmflg);

shmget函数用来获取一个内存区的ipc标识，这个标识在内核中，属于一个身份标识符号（ipc标识符，正常情况下是不会重复的，但是标识符也有限制的，比如linux2.4最大为32768，用完了就会重新计算），通过shmget调用，会返回给我们当前的ipc标识，如果这个共享内存区本来就不存在，就直接创建，否则就把当前标识直接返回给我们！说了一大堆，其实很简单，就相当于给我们返回了一个代表该共享内存的标识罢了！
shmat
void *shmat(int shmid, const void *shmaddr, int shmflg);

shmat把一个共享内存区域添加到进程上，我们之前在mmap这一章节有提到过线性区的概念，就是进程可用的一组地址（可以用，但是用的时候才真正分配），而shmat就把共享内存的这块地址，通过（shmid   shmget可以获取到的）放到了进程中的可用地址范围内，用范围内的合适地址（shmaddr这里指进程想要发生映射的可用地址）指向了共享内存实际的地址，可以见上图！
shmdt
int shmdt(const void *shmaddr);

用于从当前进程把指定的共享内存sh…</span>

尽管之前微软声称 DogWalk 漏洞不构成安全问题，但微软现在已经发布了一个补丁，以阻止攻击者积极利用该漏洞。该漏洞允许攻击者利用 Windows 微软支持诊断工具（MSDT）的一个弱点，以欺骗用户访问一个虚假的网站或打开一个恶意的文件，最终在被攻击的系统上获得远程代码执行。该漏洞在 2020 年 1 月首次被报告，影响到所有支持的 Windows 版本。但当时微软表示，它不认为该漏洞是一个安全问题。这是近几个月来微软第二次被迫改变对一个已知漏洞的立场，之前也曾拒绝承认另一个 MSDT 漏洞构成安全威胁，但在今年 6 月提供了补丁。

百度获得中国首批完全无人驾驶出租车的服务许可证

据报道，中国首批完全自主的，没有安全司机的商业机器人出租车，即将在武汉和重庆对公众乘客开放。这两张新颁发的许可证允许百度在上述城市限定区域内提供无人驾驶收费出租车服务，每个区域将运行五辆第五代阿波罗汽车。如果车辆遇到任何棘手的情况，远程司机将会进行控制。之前，百度已经在中国一线城市使用相同的第五代汽车提供出租服务，但车上有备用司机。

英特尔 x86 CPU 份额跌破七成

来自统计机构的最新数据显示，刚过去的二季度，桌面处理器销量创下 30 年来的新低，但 AMD 在移动笔记本、台式机、服务器以及整个 x86 市场的份额，都在继续增长。从整个 x86 处理器市场来看，AMD 的市场占比已经提高到 31.4%，也就是说英特尔的 x86 市场份额已不足七成。

Thomas：大家好，我叫 Thomas，我从 2012 年左右就在 CentOS 社区工作，从基础架构相关的工作开始，后来负责组织CentOS Dojo（译者注：CentOS Dojos 是一个为期一天，或偶尔为 2 天的活动，它将 CentOS 社区的人们聚集在一起，讨论系统管理、最佳实践和新兴技术），致力于帮助人们更好地融入社区，创造良好的氛围，让大家可以更开心的从事社区相关的工作。好，现在交给 Brian。

Brian：大家好，我叫 Brian，我参与社区的经历和 Thomas 差不多。我很积极地投入到企业级 Linux 社区的工作已经有六七年时间，在那之前我更多的是企业级 Linux 的被动使用者，作为社区贡献者偶尔也对企业 Linux 社区有些贡献。事实上现在我是在红帽工作，我负责 RHEL 的业务战略，但今天我出现在这里，是因为我的另一个身份是 CentOS 社区董事会的红帽联络员。同时，我也参与过大量的社区工作，包括…</span>

                              <span>使用 Watchtower 自动更新 Docker 容器基础镜像


对开发运维人员来说，保持 Docker 容器为最新版本是重要工作之一。手动更新 Docker 容器是一项耗时的工作。这篇文章解释了 Watchtower 是什么，如何安装它，以及在 Linux 中如何 使用 Watchtower 自动更新正在运行的 Docker 容器 。

Watchtower 是什么？

Watchtower 是一款自由开源的应用，用来监控运行中的 Docker 容器，并且当它发现基础镜像被更改后，可以自动的更新容器。

若 Watchtower 发现一个运行中的容器需要更新，它会以发送 SIGTERM 信号的方式，优雅的结束运行中容器的运行。

它会下载新镜像，然后以最初部署时使用的方式，重启容器。所有文件会在后台自动下载，因此不需要用户的介入。

在这份指南中，我们将会明白如何在类 Unix 系统中使用 Watchtower 自动更新正在运行的 Docker 容器。

我已经在 CentOS 和 Ubuntu 中测试了这份指南，所有的 Linux 发行版中操作过程都一样。

在 Linux 中安装 Watchtower

可以通过 Docker 镜像的方式下载 Watchtower 。因此，部署它是小事一桩。在你的 Linux 中安装 Docker 镜像，然后运行 Watchtower 立即开始监控 Docker 容器。

                              <span>使用 LibreOffice 模板快速开始在 Linux 上写作。


任何办公软件套件中的主要部件都是文字处理器。无论你的需求如何，从记笔记到写书，文字处理器都能完成工作。大多数 Linux 发行版都包含 LibreOffice 套件，我使用 LibreOffice Writer 作为我的文字处理器。

LibreOffice Writer 通过其工具栏、键盘快捷键和菜单提供了很大的灵活性。但是，如果你只是想轻松地开始一个文档，你可以使用其中一个预加载的模板。以下是如何使用 LibreOffice Writer 模板让你的工作更轻松。

开始一个新文档

LibreOffice Writer 从一个空白文档开始。大多数人就从这里开始写作，但这也是从模板创建新文档的地方。

首先，打开“文件File”菜单，然后选择“新建New”、“模板Templetes”。此选项会打开模板选择对话框：



模板选择对话框显示系统上可用的不同模板。默认的 LibreOffice Writer 安装包括用于不同类型的商务信函、简历和其他文档的模板。你可以使用对话框顶部的过滤器选项浏览列表或缩小结果范围。



单击你想要的模板，然后单击“打开Open”以使用此模板开始一个新的 Writer 文档。一些模板包括样板文本或其他示例材料，你可以使用这些材料开始编写新文档。例如，现代商务信函由以下 “lorem ipsum” 示例文本组成：



其他文档模板只是为你提供了一个具有一些漂亮的默认设置的空文档的起点。例如，现代文档模板对文本正文使用无衬线字体（例如 Linux 系统上的 Carlito）：



下载模板

如果你在内置选项中没有找到所需的模板，你可以从 LibreOffice 的网站下载合适的文档模板。进入 LibreOffice 扩展以开始使用 LibreOffice 扩展和模板库。



在框中输入搜索词以查找你需要的文档模板。例如，学生可能会搜索 “APA” 来查找为 APA 样式设置的文档模板，这是学术论文的常见样式。



总结

如果你需要编写文档，请浏览 LibreOffice 模板以找到适合你的模板。使用模板意味着你可以花费更少的时间来设置文档以使其具有某种外观，并且可以更快地工作。在支持你的工作的 LibreOffice 扩展和模板库中查找其他文档模板。

                              <span>经过了一个月，可能是在讨论、会谈和对话之后，Cutefish OS 正式重启了开发。

不久前，我们报道了 Cutefish OS 停止开发，而且 GitHub 上没有任何活动。好吧，看起来开发者在 GitHub 上复活了这个项目，并对该操作系统的未来有了一些设想。

7 月 31 日，Cutefish OS 的 GitHub 主仓库进行了更新，内容如下：


你喜欢的 CutefishOS 现在回来了！新网站正在建设中（即将推出）


不仅如此，该团队还简要介绍了这个项目的路线图。



Cutefish OS 的开发：即将到来的里程碑

首先，主要目标是官方网站的准备工作。

其次，根据 GitHub 上的说明，下一个版本可能会基于 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS。Cutefish OS 有不同的桌面定制版，如 Ubuntu 和 Debian。另外，你可以在 Arch Linux 上只安装Cutefish 桌面。

第三，该团队旨在评估当前的问题并开始接受拉取请求。完成这项工作后，将更容易确定需要修复的项目的优先次序。最后，为未来版本的新功能进行规划。

不仅如此，还有一种可能性，即用 openEuler Linux 开发新的 Cutefish 桌面定制版。openEuler Linux 是华为为商业和企业用途而创建的一个发行版。



（LCTT 译注：但是从 GitHub 仓库来看，最近并没有任何实质动作。）

一个新的名字？

当我在寻找更多的信息时，我发现该团队注册了一个新的域名，有一个新的名字，即 openfish.org（LCTT 译注：因无备案，展示无法访问）。桌面环境或整个操作系统将被重新命名为 openfish。在这一点上，我有一个猜测：

旧的域名 cutefishos.com 可能被别人接管了，因此这样决定。

但是，在我看来，“openfish” 是一个比 “cutefish” 更好的品牌名称。

（LCTT 译注：究竟是原班人马中的部分人决定重启，还是整个团队复活，目前不得而知，从改名上看，似乎新的团队并没有 cutefish 相关的品牌控制权。）

下一步是什么

最新的 0.8 版有几个与键盘、设置窗口、Flatpak 应用程序等有关的问题。最好的办法是在最后的基线上首先解决这些问题。然后可能是带有额外功能的 1.0 版本。

希望在未来几周内，我们能看到更多关于开发的更新。如果你想发表意见，询问有关期望或功能要求，在 GitHub 上创建一个帖子。

欢迎回来，Cutefish OS。

前言
Java Finalizer 机制提供了一个在对象被回收之前释放占用资源的时机，但是都说 Finalizer 机制是不稳定且危险的，不推荐使用，这是为什么呢？今天我们来深入理解这个问题。
这篇文章是 JVM 系列文章第 6 篇，专栏文章列表：
一、内存管理：
1、内存区域划分
2、垃圾回收机制
3、对象创建过程
4、对象内存布局
5、引用类型
6、Finalizer 机制
二、编译链接过程
1、Java 编译过程
2、Class 文件格式
3、注解处理器
4、注解机制
5、类加载机制
6、泛型机制
三、执行系统
1、方法调用与返回
2、重载与重写
3、反射机制
4、异常机制
提示：很多内容都已经发表过了，最近会整理出来
学习路线图：

1. 认识 Finalizer 机制
1.1 为什么要使用 Finalizer 机制？
Java 的 Finalizer 机制的作用在一定程度上是跟 C/C++ 析构函数类似的机制。当一个对象的生命周期即将终结时，也就是即将被垃圾收集器回收之前，虚拟机就会调用对象的 finalize() 方法，从而提供了一个释放资源的时机。
1.2 Finalizer 存在的问题
虽然 Java Finalizer 机制是起到与 C/C++ 析构函数类似的作用，但两者的定位是有差异的。C/C++ 析构函数是回收对象资源的正常方式，与构造函数是一一对应的，而 Java Finalizer 机制是不稳定且危险的，不…</span>

                              <span>「本文参与数字文具盒征文活动」
在进入正题之前我先和大家聊一点题外话。
首先简单介绍一下我的情况。我是一个商科的博士生，专业是marketing，研究兴趣很杂，做过的东西很多，我刚刚结束博一的学期，开始给自己放假。从最开始接触科研到现在其实并没有很长时间，可以说还是一个科研小白。
但是这一年我的心态变化很大。一开始不断地怀疑自己到现在有一点点自信。这些变化其实是需要一些总结的，但是因为实在是太忙，一直没有进行总结和反思。正好借着这个活动的机会，我也对我过去一段时间进行一些总结和回顾。
关于科研相关的软件，我可能没有什么「高大上」的软件以及使用攻略或者使用心得。我使用的软件大部分都是市面上常见的，使用起来几乎没有任何门槛。这篇文章就是想和大家分享一下一个普通博士生科研日常，也欢迎大家分享自己的看法。
我将分为三个部分分享我的「数字文具盒」，分别是文献阅读与文献整理、论文写作、云。
文献阅读与文献整理
文献阅读其实占了我科研的很大一部分。因为很多研究都是站在巨人的肩膀上，所以一定要阅读前人的研究。在阅读文献的同时也需要进行文献的整理。而我选择使用的软件都是非常容易入门的，可能过程中会略有耗时，但是我阅读、整理之后的文献我很难忘记。
EndNote
EndNote几乎是我最常用的文献管理软件了。只需要将已经下载好的论文进行导入，EndNote就会识别文章的必要信息并且进行展示。导入之后也可以对该文献进行评级。在界面右侧有也原文献的展示。

如果是导入整个文件夹，EndNote还会创建一个组，将该文件夹中的所有文献进行导入和识别。文件夹中的子文件夹还会自动被EndNote创建为分组。在组内也可以进行文献搜索。

之前有人说EndNote对中文文献无法识别，因此用中文写作的话不太适合用EndNote。现在知网等国内检索平台支持EndNote格式的引用，只需要复制或者下载相应的引用就可…</span>

Linux 中的 ls 命令是最常用的命令。此命令列出终端中的文件和目录。因此，如你所见，它非常流行，也许每个人都在使用。

但该命令输出的信息量很大，有时用彩色的方式查看它们会更方便。

例如，如果你以最基本的方式运行 ls 命令，它应该看起来有点像这样：



这似乎有点乏味，不是吗？如果你可以对其进行一些样式设置，以便在看起来不错的同时变得更具可读性如何？

以样式列出文件和目录

lsd

我想向你展示的第一个应用叫做 lsd，也就是 “LSDeluxe” 的缩写。它是对 GNU ls 命令的重写，具有列标题、各种项目的颜色、字体和图标支持等附加功能。

这是安装后的样子：

lsd -l --header




正如你所看到的，它看起来非常漂亮，用不同的颜色代码表示权限、文件类型和文件夹，甚至在文件名旁边添加图标。

该应用充满了诸如树视图（见下文）之类的功能，它甚至可以在单个命令中为你提供文件夹内的文件列表：

lsd -l --header --tree




你可以在其 官方 GitHub 页面 上了解有关其功能的更多信息。

我相信你很兴奋。让我们看看如何安装它。

你可以从 此处下载 用于 Ubuntu 和相关发行版的 deb 文件。之后，只需运行 dpkg 即可安装：

sudo dpkg -i lsd_vvvv_amd64.deb


对于 Fedora Linux，使用以下命令:

sudo dnf install lsd


Arch Linux 用户可以使用以下命令获取它：

pacman -S lsd


该应用也可用于其他发行版、macOS、BSD 和 Windows。对于这些说明，你可以 在此处找到它们。

为了获得更好的体验，请将其与 带有 Oh My Zsh 的 Zsh shell 一起使用。

exa

下一个程序是 exa，类似于 lsd 但具有更多功能。exa 命令可以为你的 ls 输出着色，检测 Unix 系统中的各种文件类型、标题、树视图等更多功能。

exa 是一个单一的二进制文件，占用的资源很小。以下是一些示例命令：

exa -al


exa -abghHliS


exa -abghHliS --long --tree




你可以在 GitHub 上了解有关 exa 参数和选项的更多信息。

exa 的安装很简单，只需要一个命令。对于 Ubuntu 和相关发行版，你可以使用以下命令安装它：

sudo apt install exa


对于 Fedora 和 Arch Linux，分别使用以下命令：

sudo dnf install exa


pacman -S exa


同样，所有其他操作系统的安装说明都可以 在此处找到。

从终端复制为 HTML

一个有趣的技巧是，以上所有彩色列表都可以通过默认的 Ubuntu 终端复制为 HTML。你可以将它用于你的网页或文档。

例如，我将上面的示例复制到 LibreOffice Writer 文档中。

这是最好的功能之一，尽管它取决于终端程序而不是上面的程序。



总结

我解释了两个程序的内部工作 – lsd 和 exa 以样式列出文件和目录。我希望你能将它们用于不同的需求。

如果你喜欢它们，或者如果你知道任何此类程序，请在评论栏中告诉我。

BSD 发行版 NetBSD 刚刚释出了一个小更新版本 9.3，在一系列的对各种新硬件的支持之外，还改进了对 Commodore Amiga 的支持。这是 1985 年发布的一种 16 位计算机。甚至其开发商 Commodore 早在 1994 年就倒闭了，但 Amiga 仍然存在少数但狂热的爱好者。如果你能找到一台还能使用的 Amiga，那你就能在上面运行 2022 年的 NetBSD 了。

老王点评：这就是开源，只要你觉得好玩，你就可以做，而不用管是不是有商业价值，也不用那么一本正经。




英特尔的 Clear Linux 采用 -O3 来构建其内核

英特尔的 Clear Linux 滚动发行版以其积极的性能优化而闻名，但他们的内核构建一直采用默认的 -O2 优化，不过，上周他们切换到了用 -O3 来构建其内核。虽然上游内核已经放弃了专门的 -O3 选项，但更高的优化水平仍然可以通过编译器标志传递给内核，这就是 Clear Linux 正在做的。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：虽然 Clear Linux 采用 -O3 优化提升了多少还不得而知，但对于 Clear Linux 这种要榨取最后一滴性能来炫耀英特尔的 CPU 的发行版来说，显然是有意义的。




谷歌将停止为愚蠢的问题提供答案

“特色片段”是向谷歌搜索提出的问题而直接回复的片段，长期以来一直是该公司人工智能战略的一个基石，同样的技术也用于其智能音箱和语音助手。谷歌试图改进其“特色片段”服务，以停止对愚蠢的问题提供简短的答案。这意味着诸如“史努比什么时候刺杀了林肯？”这样的问题不会得到答案，谷歌搜索曾经给出过回答“1865 年&quot; —— 日期正确，但刺客非常错误。谷歌对其系统进行了训练，以更好地检测这些虚假的问题。


消息来源：英国卫报



老王点评：给傻问题做出回答，显然也是傻的，这又是愚弄 AI 的一种方式。

Documentation is an important part of any technical project. Good documentation tells the end user how to run the program, how to use it, or how to compile it. For many projects, plain text documentation is the standard. After all, every system can display plain text files.
However, plain text is limiting. Plain text files lack formatting elements like italics text, bold text, and titles. To add these elements, we can leverage HTML. HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the markup language used in all web browsers. And with a little extra effort, you can use HTML to write project documentation that can be read by everyone.

I am teaching Python using Raspberry Pi 400 computers in a local library for the second year in a row. A couple of this year&#x27;s students have not experienced success with mathematics in their school. One asked me if she needed algebra to attend our class. I told her I had failed algebra, geometry, and trigonometry in school. She was relieved. Another student rushed in the door a bit late because she was taking geometry in summer school after failing to pass the course during the school year. I shared my own story of learned helplessness and my distress at the thought of math tests. My own bad experiences impacted my high school and early colleg…</span>

                              <span>https://lockrmail.com/product-re...), but I am most excited to share with you the first iteration of Digests!
 
🎉 Introducing Digests 🎉
As productivity enthusiasts, we created lockrMail to give you more control over your inbox, but one key aspect was always missing - the WHEN. 
 
To say receiving emails throughout the day is distracting is an understatement. If you’re like me, you’re constantly taking small breaks to check your inbox - interrupting your work productivity or even time with friends and family on the weekends. With lockrMail Digests, you can limit the volume of communications you receive by bundling similar Senders into a single digest. You can also control when that email is received, effectively optimizing delivery to fit your busy schedule.
 
🔒About lockrMail 🔒
lockrMail is a new email, but not a new inbox. When you sign-up for lockrMail, you create a public-facing email address that you can feel confident using across the web. lockrMail seamlessly forwards all communication to your current inbox.  You can decide if you want to allow or block a sender, add a filter, block an entire domain, and (now!) create a digest. 

🧹Reduce inbox clutter - pre-filter for relevant content. 
🚫 Preserve your privacy - never give out your personal email again.
📧 Maintain your email routine - lockrMail seamlessly forwards all communication to any email client. 
 
lockrMail is a FREE product. While Digests is currently an early access feature, for this week only (in celebration  of our Product Hunt launch! 🚀) we are offering instant 🔥 access to Digests for all new Product Hunt users. Simply register with the link above and snag your preferred username while it&#x27;s still available! 
 
For any existing lockrMail users, you need only refer one friend to lockrMail and we’ll give you access to Digests as well. 
 
My team and I so appreciate your support and look forward to your questions and feedback! 🙏

🔥 Hi，我是小彭。本文已收录到 GitHub · AndroidFamily 中。这里有 Android 进阶成长知识体系，有志同道合的朋友，关注公众号 [彭旭锐] 带你建立核心竞争力。
前言
Java Reference 类型是与虚拟机垃圾回收机制密切相关的知识点，同时也是面试重要考点之一。 一般认为 Java 有四种 Reference（强引用 &amp; 软引用 &amp; 弱引用 &amp; 虚引用），但是其实还有隐藏的第五种 Reference，你知道是什么吗？
在这篇文章里，我将总结引用类型的用法 &amp; 区别，并基于 ART 虚拟机分析相关源码。如果能帮上忙，请务必点赞加关注，这真的对我非常重要。
提示： 本文源码分析基于 Android 9.0 ART 虚拟机。
这篇文章是 JVM 系列文章第 5 篇，专栏文章列表：
一、内存管理：
1、内存区域划分
2、垃圾回收机制
3、对象创建过程
4、对象内存布局
5、引用类型
6、Finalizer 机制
二、编译链接过程
1、Java 编译过程
2、Class 文件格式
3、注解处理器
4、注解机制
5、类加载机制
6、泛型机制
三、执行系统
1、方法调用与返回
2、重载与重写
3、反射机制
4、异常机制
提示：很多内容都已经发表过了，最近会整理出来
学习路线图：

1. 认识 Java 引用
1.1 Java 四大引用类型
Java 引用是 Java 虚拟机为了实现更加灵活的对象生命周期管理而设计的对象包装类，一共有四种引用类型，分别是强引用、软引用、弱引用和虚引用。我将它们的区别概括为 3 个维度：
维度 1 - 对象可达性状态的区别： 强引用指向的对象是强可达的，而其他引用指向的…</span>

很高兴遇见你~
在本系列的上一篇文章中，我们介绍了 Flutter 开发环境搭建，以及使用 AndroidStudio 运行你的第一个 Flutter 项目，体验了热重载。还没有看过上一篇文章的朋友，建议先去阅读Flutter 系列（一）：运行你的第一个 Flutter 应用，在我看来，Dart 在设计时应该是借鉴了百家语言之所长😄：Java，Kotlin等：
1、在静态语法方面，如：类型定义，方法声明，泛型等，和 Java 非常相似
2、一些语法特性，如：函数式特性，空安全，函数默认值等，和 Kotlin 非常相似
3、Dart 还有一些自己独创的语法，如：命名构造方法，级联操作符等
总之，熟悉之后，你会发现 Dart 是一门非常有意思的编程语言，接下来就让我们一起进入 Dart 的语法学习吧
注意： Dart 语法和 Java，Kotlin 真的很像，尤其是 Java。另外如果对 Kotlin 语法不熟的，可以去看我的另外一篇文章：&quot;Kotlin&quot;系列: 一、Kotlin入门
一、变量和方法
1.1、变量
1）、Dart 可以显示指明类型来声明一个可变的变量。且指明的类型分为可空和非空
2）、Dart 也可以使用 var 关键字来声明一个可变的变量，此时编译器会根据变量初始值自动推断类型
3）、Dart 使用 final 关键字来声明一个不可变的变量，且可以替代 var 或加在类型前面
4）、Dart 中变量如果是非空类型，那么必须给一个默认值，否则无法编译通过。如果是可空类型，默认值都为 null
5）、Dart 中每一行代码都要加 ; 😂，走回头路了，有点鸡肋

前言
本篇我们继续介绍 Flutter 绘图的 Path 的应用。Flutter 的 Path 类提供了一个三维空间的变换方法，可以实现路径在三维空间的平移、旋转等操作，从而可以实现3D 绘制的效果。通过本篇你将了解到：
Path的三维转换方法 transform 的使用。
绕三维空间某一点的旋转实现。
卡片3D 旋转动效。
类似日历的三维翻页效果。
Path 的 transform 方法
Path 类的 transform 方法 将给定的Path 通过一个Float64List的对象进行三维变换，然后返回变换后的 Path对象，方法定义如下。
Path transform(Float64List matrix4) {
  assert(_matrix4IsValid(matrix4));
  final Path path &#x3D; Path._();
  _transform(path, matrix4);
  return path;
}

其中 Float64List 一般都是通过 Matrix4 对象的 storage得到，例如我们在 x 方向平移5.0，可以按如下方式得到对应的 Float64List 对象。
var transform &#x3D; (Matrix4.identity()
  ..translate(5.0, 0.0, 0.0)).storage;

Matrix4提供了平移、旋转、逆矩阵等多种方法，有兴趣的可以看一下 Matrix4的源码，实际上就是大学线性代数课（这门课还挺难的😂）的矩阵乘法内容。
绕任意点旋转
网上关于绕任意点的旋转推导很多，这里就不再赘述，结论就是实际上三个矩阵，…</span>

0x1、引言
如题，最近两周疲于折腾公司第三方SDK升级，掉坑里一直出不来，前天突发奇想，终于定位到问题原因。

问题很简单，却花费了这么长时间，终究还是我太菜了！

BUG虽然解了，但觉得还是有必要 记录复盘下，以便下次遇到类似问题时，能找到更好的切入点，更快地把问题解决。
问题概述
现在哪个房产类APP不上VR全景图啊，所以我司也整了一个，经纪人录盘时，使用全景相机对盘源进行拍摄，在录盘填信息的同时，把全景图也上传到服务器。而他们录盘的过程是这样的：
使用 全景相机官方APP，连接相机，对盘源进行拍摄，官方APP拼接生成全景图；
拍完打开 公司APP，来到录盘页，填写录盘信息，然后打开手机相册，选择对应的全景图上传；
录一次盘得在两个APP间来回切换，可以是可以，但流程繁琐，效率也低，他们更希望：
直接就在公司APP上就可以完成相机连接、拍摄、拼接和上传。
任务传到客户端这边，所以我们需要：
集成官方SDK，参考官方Demo和文档，根据具体业务进行二次开发。
杰哥徒手封装的Library已经稳定跑了两年：

本以为可以一劳永逸，安享晚年，最近却出了幺蛾子：

有经纪人买了新款相机，然后用公司APP无法拍照。

em...硬件、固件升级，需要更新下SDK，可以理解，那就升吧，正当我以为这次升级，会像当初刚集成时那样 丝滑流畅，却是 磨人踩坑 的开始...

0x2、第一道坎：SDK自带预览组件黑屏
很快新的SDK到位，Library替换上新AAR，API有些变动，跟着Demo改改，算是跑起来了，但问题也来了：
拍摄预览页 → 关闭并跳转新页面 → 再次打开预览页 → 预览组件黑屏
看了下官方Dem…</span>

前言
HashMap 这个词想必大家都挺熟悉的！但往往大多数都知其所用，而不知其原理，导致面试的处处碰壁！因此，这一篇的作用就是以面试的角度剖析HashMap！话不多说，直接开始！
温馨提示：此文有点长，建议先插眼，等有空闲时间观看
1、为什么要学HashMap?
刚刚说了本篇是以面试角度剖析HashMap，那么面试常见的问题有哪些呢？
HashMap的原理？内部数据结构？
HashMap中put方法的过程是怎样实现的？
HashMap中hash函数是怎样实现的？
HashMap是怎样扩容的呢？
HashMap中某个Entry链太长，查找时间复杂度可能达到O(n)，怎么优化？
2、剖析HashMap
2.1 HashMap初始化
虽然这一步大家很熟悉，但过程还是少补了！
HashMap hashMap &#x3D; new HashMap(6, 1);
HashMap hashMap2 &#x3D; new HashMap();

源码解析
这个就很简单了，初始化HashMap有两个构造器，一个无参，一个有参。（泛型就不说了吧）
那就从简先看无参的！

/**
 * The default initial capacity - MUST be a power of two.
 */
static final int DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY &#x3D; 1 &lt;&lt; 4; // aka 16

/**
 * The load factor used when none specified in constructor.
 */
static final float DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR &#x3D; 0.75f;

public HashMap() {

本文参与数字文具盒征文活动。

因为去年写了这篇文章分享我的 workflow，所以在这次的征文题目公布时，少数派的编辑也贴心的来问我有没有想分享的工具。说实话，对于这次的征文题目，我是喜忧参半：喜的是可以期待一波好工具的分享，满足我对工具的探索欲； 忧的是对工具探索的过度好奇往往会占用额外的时间和精力，反而加剧了我的论文写作拖延症。 相信很多少数派的读者和我一样，对于新的工具总是充满好奇，迫不及待地探索一番后，又很快搁置到一边， 真正能用下去的工具往往还是那几个常用的。
我想，造成此类现象的原因可能有以下几个：

一些工具虽然有全新的名字和界面，但是功能往往与已有的工具重合，并不能给工作效率带来实质帮助；
对于一些工具类软件而言，开发新的功能毕竟困难，于是转而希望努力改变或者教导用户一套新的方法论或使用逻辑。然而，愿景虽好，但这往往并没有从用户的实际需要出发，反而带来了过高的学习成本；
工具自身的缺陷问题：譬如平台覆盖不足，导入导出不够开放，系统不够稳定，字体不够大，等等；
工具本身提供了简单且实用的功能，但是介绍中并没有提供实际的应用场景，所以有时不知如何将之纳入自己的工作流中进行合理使用；
个人主观的好恶。

当然，作为一个不懂任何工具开发的文科菜鸟，我自然也没有资格吹毛求疵，对工具大加评判。在本文中，我只想从一个长期用户的实际使用体验出发，分享一些我实际研究学习过程中真正用到的一些工具，希望为你带来一点点参考。
另外，我每天用到的学术工具首先包括 DEVONthink、Obisidian、Zotero 和 Scrivene…</span>

                              <span>前言
我是阿杜，目前在开发一款笔记类应用 岁月笔记 。2020 年苹果推出过一个「轻 App (App Clips)」功能，让我们不需要下载安装 也能使用，号称苹果版小程序；
但是时至今日一直被当做APP的阉割版，作为苹果公司推出的系统级小程序,或许有更酷的交互方式；
正好做的APP内有个信件模块，用户写好信件后分享生成图片，这样交互太呆板了，不太友好；可以利用AppClip，把信件写入NFC卡片，让手机靠近NFC，弹出信件卡片！
效果如下👇🏻

原理
其实原理也很简单，就是把信件编辑好写入NFC，然后卡片调起信件；

NFC只要是苹果支持的DNEF数据格式的白卡都可以,某多多上有卖的；
刚开始是这样的
白卡
然后设计图案后，交由厂家打印成卡贴后贴在 NFC 卡片上。

外观
只有一个卡片也不太拿得出手，所以给它设计了一个盒子
外包装

                              <span>万万没想到，时隔多年我又开始用上了QQ。
起因是需要打包一些软件给朋友，发微信超过了200M限制，好不容易传上了网盘，朋友那边的下载速度却只有几十k。我实在没辙了，朋友突然提议说——为何不在QQ传给他？
QQ？
我已经卸载好多年了。这个一路承载了我青春回忆的应用，却在我年龄渐长后变成了不堪回首的过往，转而封锁空间、卸载停用。
只能偶尔在媒体上了解到其主力军已经变成了00后，且功能越来越花里胡哨。最新版本更是因为搭配虚幻4引擎、大小达到800M，而被戏称为腾讯3A大作。
朋友这次提起，我才知道原来QQ传送文件竟没有大小限制，速度也很快，连钉钉都有限制大小，QQ竟这么勇的吗？好奇心驱使我去下载了最新的8.9.3版本来体验，意外发现如今的QQ还真有许多妙用，当然槽点也不少，且听我细细道来。

聊天斗图很过瘾
在微信斗图时是不是常苦恼表情包不够？在QQ这里完全没这种烦恼！
在聊天输入框搜索，就会弹出表情，不用像微信一样单独去搜，搜图贼快！

如果你连表情都懒得搜，QQ还能智能帮你斗图！这在QQ叫“怼图”，即聊天中如果 20 秒内连续出现三次图片即可触发怼图标记，点击一下标记，系统就会根据对方发的表情自动帮你斗图，简直不要太爽。

如果这还不够过瘾，QQ还有招！
长按常规表情包，可以触发弹射功能，届时就能看到满屏幕的表情乱飞，看着就很解压。

可能是觉得表情包停留在视觉动效，还不足以抚平年轻人躁动的心，所以QQ还增加了触感的刺激。选择“戳一戳”好友，不同的动作会让手机产生不同节奏的震动，交互很爽。

如果觉得公共表情不够独特，你也可以自己捏脸换装，生成专属形象的表情包，也十分地酷。

表情方面很多玩法，语音上也放开了限制。
微信语音上限为60秒，而QQ语音可达到120秒，与之配套的还有语音进度条，想拖到哪都行，也支持变音。
 （感激微信最多支持60秒语音，不然对于经常收到长辈关爱语音…</span>

This is the second article in a two-part series on energy disruption that could lead to open organization projects. In the first part, based on the book, Clean Disruption of Energy and Transportation, by Tony Seba, I discussed disruption in the use of electric vehicles over internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, the use of self-driving over human-driven vehicles, and the use of solar power generation over nuclear power generation.
In this second part, I will discuss additional potential projects likely to introduce more disruption, specifically the use of solar power generation over other sources. Solar power has advantages over other pr…</span>

I feel confident in claiming that HTML is the most widely used markup language ever. While other markup languages exist, including nroff and groff, LaTeX, and Markdown, no other markup language is as widespread as the Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the de facto language of the Web. First implemented in web browsers in 1994, the language continues to evolve. Yet the basics of HTML remain the same.
If you are just getting started in HTML, I wanted to offer this gentle introduction to learning HTML. I focus on the essentials of HTML to build a basic understanding of how HTML works. You can use this as a starting point to learn more about HTML.

本文又名：Android Studio插件开发（二）：Editors编辑篇
之前的阅读量太低了，换个名字看看会不会高点，o(╥﹏╥)o
概述
作为连Setter和Getter都要生成的程序猿来说，时不时还要手写重复的代码简直不能忍。而本篇文章，讲的就是如何开发一个简单的自动生成插件，来帮你完成一键生成重复代码。
最终要实现的效果有：
智能识别  只有在需要满足条件且需要生成的地方，才会提供生成功能
自动生成  选择文本，根据关键词，生成特定的代码
创建插件
上一篇文章有讲过，首先要创建一个AutoEditorAction，然后在plugin.xml中注册
class AutoEditorAction: AnAction() {
    override fun actionPerformed(event: AnActionEvent) {

    }
}


    //添加在编辑弹框的第一位
    


定义菜单操作的可见性
应该有注意过，Android Studio里菜单栏下面的功能，并非一直可以点击，有时候是置灰状态，有时候甚至没有显示出来。这些都是通过AnAction里的update方法来控制的。

🔥 Hi，我是小彭。本文已收录到 GitHub · AndroidFamily 中。这里有 Android 进阶成长知识体系，有志同道合的朋友，关注公众号 [彭旭锐] 带你建立核心竞争力。
前言
昨天，看到飞书团队一篇技术分享 《如何解决前端常见的竞态问题》 ，自己的项目中也存在类似的问题，也是容易出 Bug的地方。字节这篇文章是从 Web 端的视角切入的，借鉴意义有限，这篇文章我们从 Android 的视角展开讨论。
其实，异步竞态问题并不是一个难题，但是本着精益求精的态度，对问题做一次全面分析，再思考有哪些解决方案，哪些是最优最适合的方案，对自己和社区都会有帮助。本文示例程序已上传到 Github：DemoHall · RaceRequestDemo，有用请给 Star，谢谢。
学习路线图：

1. 什么是竞态问题
1.1 问题定义
简单来说， 竞态问题就是用户短时间内重复地触发同一个动作产生多个异步请求，而由于请求的响应时延是不稳定的，可能会出现早发起的请求反而比晚发起的请求慢响应的情况，导致界面呈现效果出现混乱、重复、覆盖等异常。
为了帮助你理解问题，以下列举出更多常见的竞态场景：
1、搜索关联词： 在搜索输入栏中，随着用户输入显示对应的关联词，竞态问题可能会展示旧的搜索词的关联词；
2、类型切换： 在列表流中，点击不同的类型选项展示对应类型的数据，竞态问题可能会展示旧类型数据，或重复展现多个状态的数据；
3、下拉刷新： 在加载分页数据的同时下拉刷新，竞态问题可能会导致刷新后展示旧的分页数据，而不是最新的数据。
1.2 问题分解
我们试着对竞态问题进行拆解，梳理出竞态问题的必要条件：

前言
在实际项目开发中会频繁的用到线程，线程使用起来是很简单，但是滥用线程会带来性能问题， 比如启动一个线程至少 占用16kb的内存、线程过多会导致cpu的频繁切换而cpu切换成本是很高的、消耗大量用户电量等问题， 所以应该让app的线程数保持在合理水平，这是性能优化中很重要的一部分。本文对线程优化方面的知识做了一个全面总结，主要内容如下：

一、线程调度原理解析
线程调度的原理
在任意时刻，CPU 只能执行一条机器指令，每个线程只有获得了 CPU 的使用权之后才能执行指令，也就是说 在任意时刻，只有一个线程占用 CPU，处于运行状态。而我们平常所说的 多线程并发运行，实际上说的是多个线程轮流获取 CPU 的使用权，然后分别执行各自的任务。其实在可运行池当中有多个处于就绪状态的线程在等待 CPU，而 JVM 负责线程调度，按照特定机制为多个线程分配 CPU 使用权。
上面的描述提到了三个主要信息：
在任意时刻，只有一个线程占用 CPU，处于运行状态
多线程并发运行，实际上说的是多个线程轮流获取 CPU 的使用权
JVM 负责线程调度，按照特定机制为多个线程分配 CPU 使用权
线程调度模型
线程调度模型可以分为两类，分别是 分时调度模型 和 抢占式调度模型。
分时调度模型：让所有线程轮流获取 CPU 的使用权，而且均分每个线程占用 CPU 的时间片，这种方式非常公平
抢占式调度模型：JVM 使用的是抢占式调度模型，让优先级高的线程优先获取到 CPU 的使用权，如果在可运行池当中的线程优先级都一样，那就随机选取一个
Android 的线程调度
Android 的线程调度从两个因素决定，一个是 nic…</span>

                              <span>之前我分享过2T容量的M.2 SSD固态硬盘，其标称速度达到了7400MB/s。由于其发烧级别的价格，让许多小伙伴都无法接受。其实当时我也在想，难道就不能降一个规格吗？比如用5000MB/s的SSD固盘，难道PS5主机会真的无法识别？还是说速度上会有较大的影响呢。
这次我从朋友那入了一条大华的C970 SSD固态硬盘，本来是装机用的，现在先拿来测试一下在PS5主机内的情况，希望能解开各位小伙伴的疑问。

PS5主机内部大概是825GB的存储空间，实际可用约为677.2GB容量。以现今PS5游戏的容量来说，随便安装10个游戏都满了，特别是开了第二档会员后。幸好PS5提供了内置M.2 SSD扩充槽，可以增加主机的存储容量。

对于M.2 SSD的规格是否有要求？

翻阅官方说明可以看到，PS5的内置M.2 SSD的规格需要M插槽类型，长度支持2230、2242、2260、2280、22110，单面或者双面M.2 SSD均可，存储大小在250GB至4TB，建议连续读取速度达5500MB/s或更高。换句话说，就是推荐采用PCIe Gen4.0x4传输模式，速度能达到5500MB/s以上，容量4TB以下的SSD固态硬盘 。

出于对热散的需求，PlayStation 5也支持带有M.2 SSD散热“马甲”的固态硬盘安装，只不过整体厚度不能超过11.25mm。

那么是不是速度达到5500MB/s以上的M2.SSD就可以了呢？在此官方特意作出了说明。“不能保证所有符合所述规格的 M.2 SSD设备都能与您的主机配合使用，并且不对第三方产品的选择、性能或使用承担任何责任。”因此建议在选购前，先关注各个厂家的官方介绍，或者看一下用户实际体验，是否支持PS5主机。

这次咱们就用大华C970 1TB SSD固态硬盘（以下简称大华C970 SSD固态硬盘）来测试一下，究竟…</span>

最近我写东西时遇到了一些阻碍。这些问题可能你也遇到过。

想写的内容已经有人写过了，没有写的动力了，怎么办？
总觉得自己的想法和经历不值得分享出来，去浪费别人的时间。
花了时间和精力写出来了，但阅读量和反馈都很一般，信心因此被打击。

总结下来就是，我想写的，别人已经写过了；我不想写的，写着也没意思；想写的，写不清楚，别人看不懂。完了，不想写作了。
这些问题都会有一个共性矛盾，就是我带入了「别人」这个角色。「别人」已经看过的，「别人」可能不喜欢，担心浪费「别人」的时间。我们去担心「别人」，然后把不想写作的问题归咎在对自己的不自信。
但这只是一种托辞。
其实，我们创作欲的敌人不是「不自信」，而是对「面向自己写作」与「面向读者写作」这两个概念的混淆——该面向自己写的时候，念着别人；该面向别人去写的时候，觉得应该坚持自己。

面向自己写作：为了自己的求知欲、表达欲而写；
面向读者写作：为了解决读者的需求，写读者关心的内容。

是为自己写，还是为读者写？之前的我总是在这天平的两端来回摇摆。
一、我的写作经历
1.1 面向读者写作
最早启发我「写作方法」的是罗辑思维和得到，他们以「通过知识服务，为用户节约时间」的理念打磨内容，当时作为用户，我觉得这样的内容特别受用。而这种以服务的姿态来交付内容的理念，一直影响着我的写作。当时的我，觉得做内容其实就是把别人的知识，用清晰的结构（故事引入-结论先行-展开论证-结尾升华）加上简单易懂的大白话来呈现给读者就行。
我也用类似的思路对接老板的朋友打磨短内容，制作课程，写知识干货的文章，组建内容小组…</span>

                              <span>如果你持续关注这几年的新播客，不难发现几乎每周都会有品牌开设播客的动态。去年，我们还在探讨品牌播客能否成为品牌传播矩阵的标配，但如今不断增长的品牌播客已经在用事实说明，该探讨的不再只是「为什么品牌要做播客？」，还应该包括「如何做好品牌播客？」通过这几年积累的案例，我们从播放数据、节目形态等方面进行提炼，给出这份品牌播客避坑指南。
 不断扩张的品牌播客队伍   

创立播客的国内品牌主要由两部分组成：一部分是新消费品牌，一部分是各行各业的头部企业。拥有较为充足的市场预算，对于传播媒介非常敏感，拥有持续内容创作的资源，最重要的是都有建立品牌形象的需求。

在广告预算大幅缩减的环境下，许多大公司都在今年陆续进场，比如特斯拉、仲量联行、摩登天空等，都在近期开设了品牌播客。一些早期入局的品牌还在持续投入，Withinlink碚曦投资协作体出品的「贝望录」、GGV纪源资本的「创业内幕」都已规律更新超过三年。
部分2022年开播的品牌播客
经过对于近三年品牌播客的梳理，不难发现创立播客的国内品牌主要由两部分组成：一部分是新消费品牌，一部分是各行各业的头部企业。拥有较为充足的市场预算，对于传播媒介非常敏感，拥有持续内容创作的资源，最重要的是都有建立品牌形象的需求。
品牌播客成为近期的内容趋势，有三个很重要的原因：
播客市场认知不断提升，走出隐秘的角落。这点从微信指数上不难看出，去年7月31日指数为41万，今年同比翻了一倍，今年7月6日甚至猛增到了1222万。这背后可能是TME、Spotify在播客领域的持续布局，越来越多的名人大咖入场，但无论原因是什么，播客都在走进越来越多人的视野，成为不能忽视的媒介。
品牌播客也有盈利空间，并非纯投入。品牌播客也可以为其他品牌打广告，乍一听并不是件可行的事，但实际已经在发生。因为想要让受众听完一期节目，首先不能一听就是广告宣传，这样很容易劝退，内容必须足…</span>

Here at Opensource.com, we thought it would be interesting to survey some of our authors to get a feel for what tools they feel are antiquated (but perhaps still useful!) and what they think of the replacement utilities. What follows is a series of responses and a bit of fun, too.
We sent out the following prompt:
Have you discovered some of your favorite tools have become outdated or deprecated? Or maybe you just switched it up for something new?
What do you use now? Tell us a little about how you feel it is helpful to have made the switch.

Java is a platform-independent language. Programs are converted to bytecode after compilation. This bytecode gets converted to machine code at runtime. An interpreter emulates the execution of bytecode instructions for the abstract machine on a specific physical machine. Just-in-time (JIT) compilation happens at some point during execution, and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation happens during build time. 
This article explains when an interpreter comes into play and when JIT and AOT will occur. I also discuss the trade-offs between JIT and AOT.

传统原生对话框组件存在着内存泄漏、自定义程度不足的问题，开发时常会因为遇到各式各样的奇葩崩溃而烦恼，面对着产品和设计师诸如“对话框圆角大一些”、“能不能照着iOS设计稿的模糊效果做”、“下滑列表界面自动关掉对话框”等等诸多需求又难以解决，又不想每次封装或编写一大堆的代码去实现某一个小小的提示框需求，你可以试试 DialogX，它足以满足大部分场景下快速完成对话框、阻断提示框、非阻断提示框、底部对话框等等各式各样的对话框组件，又能完美满足各种主题和功能扩展需求，极大地方便了开发流程，帮助你快速构建应用对话框功能。
DialogX 的 Github 地址：https://github.com/kongzue/DialogX
易用性对比
对比传统 AlertDialog，DialogX 具有很大的优势：
DialogX 采用全新的实现方式，默认 View 实现方式更为轻便，亦可选 Window、DialogFragment 实现方式，自由灵活。
DialogX 的启动与线程无关，你可以在任意线程启动 DialogX 而它都将自动在 UI 线程运行。
DialogX 的启动无需 context 参数，默认提供静态方法一句代码实现对话框的启动，使用更加方便。
更自由，开发者可以轻松定制对话框中任何组件的样式，包括文本样式、按钮文字样式、菜单文本样式、输入文本样式，大到标题，小到提示消息都可以根据需要随意修改。
DialogX 采用主题分离设计，默认自带 Material 主题，可选引入 IOS、Kongzue、MIUI 等其他风格主题，大大减小 App 体积，同时提供了主题接口，如有定制需求完全可以自行实现一套私有主题。
更低的耦合度，更少的问题，DialogX 可以在对话框正在运行的过程中随意关闭 Activity ，…</span>

很多应用层开发者包括我一开始都觉得开发上层应用为什么要了解这些关于系统代码的知识，其实作为应用层开发了解一些framework层的代码是非常有必要的，我总结大概有如下几点：
了解系统组件工作机制，有助于我们解决问题，毕竟我们平时用的四大组件都是系统给我们创建好的，了解了系统组件工作机制，至少在看问题日志的调用栈可以更加清晰。
Android作为Linux上一款非常优秀的操作系统，学习Android操作系统，可以提高我们对操作系统在实现上的理解，可以让我们的技术更进一步。
本篇文章就从我们非常熟悉的Activity入手，Activity作为一个展示型组件，用于直接向用户展示一个界面，同时可以接收用户的输入信息从而进行交互，可以说Activity组件是一个App的核心，毕竟其他组件都是在后台工作。
关于Activity可以说的东西非常多，比如它的Window机制，可以查看之前的文章：
https://juejin.cn/post/7119004719892135966
以及本篇文章将涉及的AIDL通信，亦可以查看之前IPC系列文章，本篇文章的研究方向是从Activity的启动流程说起，带你看看Android系统是如何管理应用的。
本篇文章的源码是android-31，不方便查看源码的可以参考下面在线网址：

看到结局的问题：如何区分StatelessWidget 和 StatefulWidget 的使用场景，不禁开始自问，对于StatefulWidget ，StatelessWidget，以及flutter中Widget的众多子类我真的足够了解吗？
对于自己经常要打交道的东西，如果只是一知半解则不利于进步。
下面就从源码的角度来学习下flutter基础的几个Widget 都起到了什么作用。

先给个简单总结：
其中StatelessWidget 和 StatefulWidget 起到了组织组合子组件的作用。
RenderObjectWidget 起到渲染作用。包含绘制偏移和测量信息。
ProxyWidget 可以携带信息，以供其他组件使用。
一、探索StatelessWidget的组件构建
在使用StatelessWidget的时候，通常只需要实现一个build方法。就拿我们常用的Container组件举例，他就是StatelessWidget 的子类。他的build方法返回的就是各种组件的组合嵌套。

他的各种成员属性也只是用来配置子组件的组合方式而已。
1. StatelessWidget 的build调用时机，以及widget树遍历流程
Container组件是StatelessWidget的经典子类。
我们通过断点调试看看Container 组件build方法的调用堆栈

在ComponentElement 的performRebuild 方法调用的时候，触发了build方法，从stateless中获取了build返回的Widget，而又在performRebuild 调用了updateChild方法，对所有的子孙Element进行build遍历。
ComponentElement是Widget对应元素S…</span>

                              <span>Flutter的图片系统基于Image的一套架构，但是这东西的性能，实在不敢恭维，感觉还停留在Native开发至少5年前的水平，虽然使用上非常简单，一个Image.network走天下，但是不管是解码性能还是加载速度，抑或是内存占用和缓存逻辑，都远远不如Native的图片库，特别是Glide。虽然Google一直在有计划优化Flutter Image的性能，但现阶段，体验最佳的图片加载方式，还是通过插件，使用Glide来进行加载。
所以，在混编的大环境下，将Flutter的图片加载功能托管给原生，是最合理且性能最佳的方案。
那么对于桥接到原生的方案来说，主要有两个方向，一个是通过Channel来传递加载的图像的二进制数据流，然后在Flutter内解析二进制流后来解析图像，另一个则是通过外接纹理的方式，来共享图像内存，显然，第二种方案是更好的解决方案，不管从内存消耗还是传输性能上来说，外接纹理的方案，都是Flutter桥接Native图片架构的最佳选择。
虽然说外接纹理方案比较好，但是网络上对于这个方案的研究却不是很多，比较典型的是Flutter官方Plugins中的视频渲染的方案，地址如下所示。
https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/main/packages/video_player
这是我们研究外接纹理的第一手方案，除此之外，闲鱼开源的PowerImage，也是基于外接纹理的方案来实现的，同时他们也给出了基于外接纹理的一系列方案的预研和技术基础研究，这些也算是我们了解外接纹理的最佳途径，但是，基于阿里的一贯风格，我们不太敢直接大范围使用PowerImage，研究研究外接纹理，来实现一套自己的方案，其实是最好的。

为什么要使用Hilt依赖注入
之前有写过一些文章 Hilt与Koin的对比，和 Android开发中Hilt的常用场景。看起来是非常简单与实用了，但是会引起一些同学的疑问？
为什么要使用依赖注入？直接new对象不香吗？为什么要把简单的问题复杂化？
你是不是在炫技,是不是像装13？
这还真不是，如果说我使用的Dagger2，还真是炫技，NB啊。Dagger的坑也是真的多，能在大项目中把Dagger用好，那还真是牛，但是我们现在都用Hilt了有什么可装的，使用是真的简单，都是一些场景化的东西，一些固定用法。没必要没必要。
回归正题，为什么要使用依赖注入？哪种情况下推荐使用依赖注入？就算要用依赖注入，为什么依赖注入推荐使用Hilt？
一、自动管理（灵活与解耦）
首先不是说大家写项目就一定要使用依赖注入，如果大家的项目不是大项目，总共就5、6个，10多个页面，你没必要上依赖注入框架，如果是大项目，分模块，分组件，多人协同开发的，并且可能依赖的对象很复杂，或者说套娃似的对象依赖，那么使用Hilt就非常方便。不同模块/组件的开发人员直接在他自己的组件/模块下定义好对象的提供方式，另一边直接用即可，无需关系依赖的复杂度，和实现的逻辑。
我们先看看一些复杂的嵌套依赖，比如我们来一个三层套娃的依赖：
@Singleton
class UserServer @Inject constructor(private val userDao: UserDao) {

    fun testUser() {
        YYLogUtils.w(userDao.printUser())
        toast(userDao.p…</span>

缘起：从初尝到热爱，聊聊我为何享受这项运动？
我最开始接触到定向运动（orienteering）是在大学本科期间， 当时在选课系统查找体育课时，发现一门之前没有听过的课程，叫做「定向运动」，出于好奇我便选了这门课。 可能是我平时上课比较认真，加之期末考试时取得了不错的成绩，课程老师邀请我加入学校的定向运动队（我才知道学校还有专门的校队）。
因为定向运动多为户外举行，在训练的时候，我们常集体去到曾举行过定向赛事的山林、公园等，使用地图和指北针进行实地定向，我也因此得以打卡了广东不少胜地，例如深井古村、小洲村、黄山鲁、大夫山、赤水村等等。

对这项运动接触越久，我越喜欢这项运动。虽然它对脑力和体力的要求都较高，且因为经常翻山越岭而面临着受伤的风险，但也正是因为它的刺激和富有挑战性，才令我享受其中。 至于我为什么喜欢它，主要是有以下两点：
同时挑战脑力与体力：有人曾把定向运动生动地比喻成「寻宝游戏」，因为这项运动不仅仅是要依靠体力，也很考验脑力。 我们需要在有限的时间内，通过地图和指北针迅速定位到点标的位置，并快速移动完成「打点」，这就要求我们需要具备良好的识图和定位能力。刚开始训练的时候，我时常会迷路， 哪怕手里拿着地图和指北针，跑着跑着就不知道自己身处位置了。

翻山越岭：对于很喜欢户外运动的我来说， 定向运动为我提供了深入不同场景的机会，像我以往参加的赛事中，有些是在山里面举行，有些是在街道众多的小镇里面举行。场景不同，体验也富有差异。相比于其他有固定场景的运动，定向运动更符合我的喜好（虽然它也因为需要前往不同场景，而没那么便利）…</span>

                              <span>2020年的两个小故事
少数派对于我的”播客创作“而言，有很特殊的意义。2020年我为了完成自己的本科毕业论文《场景时代播客特点的新思考——播客伴随性与情感性的相关性研究》，给很多关注播客的少数派网友发了私信，请求大家帮忙填填问卷，获得了大家的热情支持和鼓励，在这里先向所有帮助过我的少数派朋友们表示感谢！！！
除此之外，2020年对于我也有非常重要的影响。我在钟南山院士宣布”人传人“的当天离开北京回到了老家，准备过年，作为一个2020年的应届毕业生，我当时还在思考如何在春招中找到一份更加令人满意的工作，以及期待夏天的毕业典礼。后来的事情大家都知道，之后我再也没能以一个在校生的身份回到我的母校中国传媒大学。
2022年，我做了一档播客
6月30日，我的播客第一期正式上线，记录了我的好朋友在疫情之中裸辞，历经三个月四处求职的故事。这档播客的名字叫做《离开定福庄以后》，是一档以中国传媒大学毕业生为线索，记录当下青年生活经历的人物叙事类播客。开启这样一档播客有很多方面的考虑，比如可操作性强，选题丰富，没有同类型内容等等，但是最重要的一点是，我和很多朋友见过的最后一面都是在疫情之前，我们从大学进入社会的正常过程似乎被完全打断了，一转眼又是两年过去，我觉得记录下不同的人在毕业后的生活经历，是非常有价值，也是非常有群体代表性的。
我的播客封面
目前为止，我已经发布了总共六期播客，在国内各大音频平台同步更新。最近，《离开定福庄以后》在网易云音乐和小宇宙上的订阅收藏量刚刚破百，可以说是一档名副其实的小播客。一开始，我也幻想过会不会做出一期节目然后直接爆火，但自己当然也明白不太可能，做出来六期节目以后，我觉得自己心里很清楚的一点是，做播客，应该是一件细水长流的事情。对于一个从零开始、单打独斗的素人而言，能够收获大量听众的肯定只是极少数，而如果把播客当作一件需要慢慢耕耘的事情来做，做好自己喜欢的…</span>

                              <span>iOS 平台可以自定义小部件的 app 有很多，有那么几种是和代码相关的，例如 JSBox、Taio 和本文的这款 Scriptable。不用码的小部件，可以根据 app 提供的方式进行自定义，而用码的小部件，则可以完全根据自己的需求来写规则，并且可以组合不同类型的信息。有码就有了更强大的自定义属性，但同时又一定程度上提高了门槛。这时候就会出现很多已经写好的示例提供给使用者，不想研究的人开箱即用，懂码的人也可以根据需求自己改改。
虽然 Scriptable有官方推荐的小部件库，但是有一些小部件是无法做到开箱即用的，例如本文要讲的这一款 iTermWidget。这是一款长的像 iTerm 的 Widget。iTerm 是一款  macOS 平台的命令行工具。命令行就是用纯文字敲出来和展示出来的东西，而 iTerm 通过区分不同代码的颜色来让信息更加易读，这样的展示方式成为了一种特色，才出现了现在这个小部件。
想要一个这样的小组件，是因为其他 App 自带的小部件所能展示信息的方式比较有限，通常我只能选择开发者做好的样子。而这款 iTermWidget 最大的特点就是字小，意味着展示的信息够多。其次它没有过多复杂的展现方式，仅仅是依靠文字和换行颜色，从信息的传达上不够直观但足够简洁。可以拥有展示多达 6 行信息的小部件（并且还可以进一步自定义），是我一直想要的。
正常情况下，在软件自带的 Gallery 里面「GET」到这个小组件后直接运行，是没有办法成功的。我在前两次下载这个 Scriptable 的时候就败在了这一步，当时就删掉了。这款软件内的小部件都是用 JavaScript 来写的，没有代码基础的人就完全无从下手。而刚好最近我在学 JavaScript，心想也许能解决之前没有搞懂的问题，想再尝试一下。但不用担心，下面的内容不涉及到 JavaScript 的具体语法等内容…</span>

                              <span>趁着2019级非全日制统招研究生迎来毕业季，2023年考研院校发布招生简章的前夕，我想以一个当事人的身份来谈谈这个被称之为「水硕」的非全日制硕士研究生，聊一聊它的前世今生，探讨一下它的是非曲直，为后来者提供一份有价值的参考。
真的假文凭

“我初中毕业都能拿下党校学历，你说好拿不好拿?其实就是花钱买文凭。我还去上课，一个月上几天吧，就在县党校，很多领导课都不上。考试时答案都有小抄，可以买，考试时监考也不严， 可以抄。就是英语对我有点难，答案我事先都在书上找好了，考试时抄上就行了，这样英语也过了。 今年春上领的毕业证，函授本科。”

这是一段对某位干部的访谈记录，截取自一篇在体制内广为流传的博士论文《中县干部1》。2009年的中县干部群体，拥有本科研究生学历堪称「标配」。被戏称为「文凭批发基地」的党校、当地院校功不可没。在党政系统内，这类注水文凭是被承认的。客观的讲，学历只是门槛，但对于拥有正规国民教育序列学历的干部来说，似乎有些不公。
如果文凭代表的是对教育质量的衡量，那么忽略了教育质量的文凭，充其量也就是「真的假文凭」。在职学历的的含金量问题一直被社会所诟病，从生源的筛选，到培养过程，整个链条弥漫着不靠谱的味道。作为在职学历中顶级代表---在职硕士研究生也是如此，不免令人扼腕叹息。有识之士已经看出，现有的在职学历教育面对其所肩负的国民教育责任日渐力不从心。
随着国家日渐强盛，也出于从构建终身学习社会的目的，国家对非全日制学历下手改革是必然的趋势。剩下的问题就是什么时候改？从哪里下手改？怎么改？终于，2016年，教育部一纸通知2，正式将硕士研究生按照学习方式分为全日制硕士研究生与非全日制硕士研究生，并规定两者均采用全国硕士研究生统考的招生模式，执行相同的培养政策和标准，学历学位证书具有同等的法律地位和相同效力。在职研究生新政策前后区别见下表：

前言
前段时间谷歌开发者公众号发布了一个 compose 进阶挑战，挑战内容是完全使用 compose 编写一个计算器 APP。
思考了一下准备做一个“仿真”形式的计算器。
那么，既然想要做“仿真”，自然少不了显示效果的还原，经典的计算器都是使用的 LCD 显示屏，通过控制不同显象区域的显示与隐藏达到显示 0-9 的数字的目的。
显示效果大致如下：

本文的内容就是通过使用 compose 的自定义绘制(Canvas)，实现上图效果。
最终实现效果如图：

开始编写
使用直线绘制
绘制主体
仔细分析上图，不难发现，其实不过就是一个由3条短横线，4条长竖线构成的 “8” 字形显示区域，通过变换不同的线段显示隐藏来生成不同的数字。
既然如此，肯定想到的就是使用 drawLine 来实现。
首先定义一个 composable 函数：
@Composable
fun LcdNumber(
    number: Int,
    modifier: Modifier &#x3D; Modifier,
    defaultColor: Color &#x3D; Color.Gray,
    numberColor: Color &#x3D; Color.Black,
    numberSize: IntSize &#x3D; IntSize(10, 30)
)

其中， number 表示要显示的数字，这里只允许传入 0-9；defaultColor 表示线段没有显示时的默认颜色； numberColor 表示线段需要显示时的颜色； numberSize 表示绘制数字的区域大小。
在开始正式实现之前，我们需要先写几个辅助方法。
首先，我们需要判断某条线段是否应该显示，为了方便说明，我们把不同线段编号如下：

然后，编写判断方…</span>

在之前的 《炫酷的 3D 卡片和帅气的 360° 展示效果》 里，我们使用手势代码和角度切换，在 2D 画板里实现了“伪” 3D 的视觉效果，就在我觉得效果还不错时， 有一位掘友提出了一个关键性的问题：卡片缺少厚度，也就是没有 3D 的质感 。





确实，如下图所示，在之前的实现里，随着卡片角度的倾斜，有两个问题特别明显：
当卡片旋转到侧边时，卡片的缺少“厚度”的质感，甚至出现了消失的情况
卡片上的文字虽然做了类似凹凸的视觉效果，但是从侧面看时也是缺少立体质感

而为了在 2D 平面实现三唯的质感，在查阅相关资料时我发现了前端的 Zdog 框架，Zdog 是一个使用 Canvas 实现的伪 3D 引擎， 它支持通过 2D 的  Canvas  API渲染出类似 3D 的效果。
Zdog  作为一个 js 框架，它大概只有 2800 多行代码，并且其最小体积为 28KB ，可以说十分轻量级。

虽然 Zdog  是一个纯 js 框架， 但既然它是通过 Canvas 实现的逻辑，那就完全可以 “轻松” 迁移到 Flutter ，毕竟 Flutter 本身就是一个重度依赖于 Canvas  的框架，而恰巧在 Flutter 社区就有针对 Zdog 的移植版本： zflutter 。
虽然这个 package 作者已经两年不维护，也没有发布 null-safety 的 pub 支持，但是既然是开源项目，自己动手风衣足食，在经过一番“简单”的迁移适配之后， zf…</span>

前提
前一阵我参照教程：GAMEBOY 仿真器 做了一个game boy模拟器，经过漫长的调试，终于成功的在电脑上运行了起来，但作为一个移动端开发者，我最终还是想要在手机上运行，在经过一番研究后，我卡在了第一个难点：在Flutter中如何单独绘制每一个像素点呢？
Gamyboy的显示器尺寸是160 * 144，素点的格式是RGB，模拟器大概每隔16ms生成一帧画面，当模拟器运行时，我就能源源不断的拿到每一帧的像素数据（这里的像素数据可以看做是一个int32数组，长度为160 * 144），我要做的就是找到一种方法，将每一帧的像素数据绘制到屏幕上。一番搜素后，终于在How do I Render Individual Pixels in Flutter?上找到了答案
绘制像素点
想要直接绘制原始的像素点，需要用到Canvas的一个方法：
/// Draws the given [Image] into the canvas with its top-left corner at the
/// given [Offset]. The image is composited into the canvas using the given [Paint].
void drawImage(Image image, Offset offset, Paint paint)

从方法签名中可以看出，canvas绘制的是一个Image对象，它持有原始的像素数据，所以我们需要先将像素数据转换成Image对象，可以使用decodeImageFromPixels方法
/// Convert an array of pixel values into an [Image] object.
///
/// The &#x60;pixels&#x60; parameter is…</span>

⚠️ 修改注册表前记录备份原始值，如果出问题还能恢复！修改注册表务必谨慎！修改注册表务必谨慎！修改注册表务必谨慎！重要的话说三遍！
如果出现 Windows Xbox Game Bar 录制的视频在 Apple 设备上播放出现绿边或花屏的情况，可以尝试。

Win + R 输入 regedit，打开注册表编辑器；
左边目录依次定位到 HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\GameDVR，打开后看右边；
VideoEncodingResolutionMode 双击打开，将值改为 0；
CustomVideoEncodingHeight 改为 1080（十进制）；
CustomVideoEncodingWidth 改为 1920（十进制）；
保存重启计算机，搞定。

                              <span>本文参与数字文具盒征文活动。

我是一名大二在读的本科生，经过大学一年的摸索，自认为对知识管理方面有一定的心得，想和各位分享一下。首先讲一下我的使用知识管理软件的理念：

不盲目追求all in one，专业的事要交给专业软件去做。
好的软件应该有助于思维方式的培养，而不是束缚自己的思考。

我将这个系统分为输入-暂存-整理-输出四部分，涵盖了知识的获取到内化的全流程，每个流程我基本都使用了不同的工具，思维导图如下。

 
一、知识输入
在信息爆炸的互联网时代，我们最不缺的就是信息，如何寻找到有用的信息便成为了关键，下面先罗列几个我平常获取知识的方式
实体书籍
我曾在网课期间有一段时间强迫自己进行完全电子化的学习，但我始终无法适应，来来回回看各种教程，折腾各类笔记软件也费时费力，于是我还是买来了纸质的课本和笔记本。对于我来说，实体书籍在我的学习中仍然占有很大一部分，简单快捷的体验可以让我更加专注于书中的内容。看到想要摘录的内容时我会手打到Flomo中，进行一个初步的提炼，也可以加深印象。虽然是分享数字文具盒，但我还是要提醒大家，不要盲目迷恋数字技术，有时回归实体也不失为一个好方法。
论文期刊网站
刚步入大学时我还没有查论文期刊的习惯，有啥新碰到的专业术语还是第一时间去查百度，得到的结果往往不知所云，有时还有很多纰漏。作为在校大学生，一般都是可以免费访问学校购买过的知网、维普、百度学术等网站的论文资源的，国外的论文也可以查谷歌学术和Sci-Hub，这些都比百度搜索出来的结果靠谱的多。
关于学术搜索有一个技巧，就是多使用「高级搜索」功能，可以找到更加准确的结果。有时你想搜索的一个定理可能不包含在论文标题中，这时在高级搜索中使用关键词搜索就会更容易检索到。以知网为例：

我想要搜索热传导当中一个叫「傅里叶定律」的东西，但直接在主题中搜索，结果太少，于是我在高级搜索中在左边选择关键…</span>
