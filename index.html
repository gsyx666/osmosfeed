                              <span>Sometimes we all need a new start - and this goes for Redis too. There are many situations where you will want to entirely wipe all data from Redis. Fortunately, it&#x27;s easy to wipe your Redis cache. First, make sure you have redis-cli installed on your computer. You can do this by installing Redis, which you can learn about here.
After that, it&#x27;s only one command to delete all the data in your Redis cache. Note: this will delete EVERYTHING - so make sure you know what you&#x27;re doing before you run this command in terminal:
redis-cli flushall

This will delete all databases and all keys. If you only want to delete all keys from the current database, you can run the following command:
redis-cli flushdb

If you&#x27;re unsure what database you&#x27;re in, you probably only have the one database - however, Redis lets us switch between databases using the following command, where index is the index of the database you want to select. By default, Redis has 16 databases, with each having a particular index numbered from 0 to 15.
redis-cli

                              <span>CI/CD has become an important part of the software development process, both in large and small companies and projects, including open source.
The most popular CI/CD systems are GitLab and Jenkins. Both of these systems are powerful, expandable and include many additional features. With the help of these systems, you can build CI/CD of any complexity.
But it often happens, especially on small projects, that the most simple and straightforward solution is needed, rather than functionality. In this case, Ansible Semaphore is a good alternative to GitLab and Jenkins.
Ansible Semaphore is a web interface for running Ansible scripts with rudimentary CI/CD. With it, you can turn your playbook into a simple CI/CD system. This is an open source project that has been in development since 2015 and c…</span>

I only needed to get it right once
Software development innovation is not like creating cars. If you create a car, and you fail a million times, you&#x27;re left with a mountain of scraps, and you&#x27;ve spent a bajillion on materials. Software development innovation is arguably much more similar to Edison&#x27;s work. When creating innovative software you can afford to fail a bajillion times, because you only need to get it right once. In a way it could be argued that it&#x27;s statistically impossible to not succeed as long as you don&#x27;t give up. I&#x27;ve got Winston Churchill on my wall …</span>

The road to getting a career in programming is a long one and some might give up midway because it requires investment as well as time but doesn&#x27;t pay immediately, but why not start one of the above you can find yourself and keep going until you get that dream job and no doubt doing one of the above or all will get you more recognized and increase your chances of getting a job.</span>

                              <span>In the following couple of articles, we&#x27;ll be building a medusa webshop.
This idea was sparked from looking for alternatives for an existing WooCommerce webshop I was looking at transferring.
My brother-in-law has a pretty large webshop with beers. For those interested, it&#x27;s debiersalon.nl.
The webshop is built on top of WooCommerce, which worked relatively ok for when he started, but it&#x27;s become relatively slow over time, takes a lot of work to keep up to date, and is quite a pain with designing custom things inside the theme.
However, it does come with many good things, at least for this specific webshop.

                              <span>We all know term called Recursion. That is same we are doing in below example to loop through multiple functions which should execute one after another.
This is one of the ways we can achive function serialization and can be usfull to your application.
const objFunctions &#x3D; [
  { func: function1, args: args1 },
  { func: function2, args: args2 }
];  //We defined functions that we want to call one by one.

function LoopFunctionOneByOneCallAfterOneAnother(objFunctions) {
  if (!objFunctions) process.exit(0); // finished
  ExecuteSingleFunctionCall(objFunctions, function (result) {
    // continue AFTER callback
    LoopFunctionOneByOneCallAfterOneAnother(objFunctions.shift());
  });
}  // notice we called same function under this function which has parameter to get next object from objFunctions.

function ExecuteSingleFunctionCall(objFunction, callback) {
  const { args, func } &#x3D; objFunction;
  func(args, callback);
} // Supportive function to execte single function. 


LoopFunctionOneByOneCallAfterOneAnother(objFunctions.shift()); // In the end we call our function.

So this whole block will execute in serialized manner.

Sometimes we have to provide the numerical values to the properties and wants a type of equations that can help us to create a constant way to apply that numerical value and you don&#x27;t have to set the values manually everytime if there is a change in the values.
Example - Suppose you created 3 elements and make them inline-block and wants them equal width and between them , a space of 30px and also wants that the entire width of the parent container to be used by those elements, Well you might think providing the elements equal width in pixels to those elements but whenever the container width changes , you have to change the width of those elements also to keep them in one row.There you will be in need of something that coul…</span>

For our first lab of the OSD 600 course, we were asked to find a partner and test and review each other’s code. This was the first time I filed issues on GitHub and learned a lot in the process. For this task, Batuhan and I teamed up to help review and test each other’s code. Batuhan is an excellent programmer and we have done many projects together in the past, including winning two hackathons together this year, presenting our research findings to the Seneca Business Week Conference, and working at Seneca Innovation to help out an industry partner of Seneca College. 
This was the first time I tested and reviewed someone else’s code so attentively. My partner did an excellent job building his Static Site Generator in C++ and used CMake to automate the compilation process and …</span>

This article was originally published at vtsen.hashnode.dev on Aug 27, 2022.
Nowadays, you have a lot of free online learning tools to learn Android development, which I highlighted few important resources here.
Free Android Development Learning Resources for Beginners
Of course, there are also the paid online learning tools. Those are very good resources too. The problem is, a lot of them still provide a similar content as the free resources. I did buy these paid online resources such as Udemy course below and e-book (not yet blog about it).

内核实时补丁允许内核在运行时安全地实施就地修补，而无需为了升级内核而进行冗长的开机自检（POST）和启动过程。Facebook 采用的是红帽的 Kpatch 方案，已经在其数百万台服务器上进行了部署。除了 Kpatch 方案之外，其它的内核实时补丁方案还有 SUSE 维护的 kGraft 和 Oracle 的 Ksplice 方案。Facebook 还分享了他们在应用过程中遇到的各种问题。

老王点评：这是我听到的内核实时补丁最大规模的部署了，看起来已经可以在大规模生产环境使用了。Facebook 的经验可以学习一下。




黑客使用木马版 PuTTY SSH 客户端植入后门

安全公司报告，黑客组织在一次针对媒体公司的钓鱼攻击中使用了木马版 PuTTY SSH 客户端。PuTTY 是流行的开源 SSH 客户端。攻击者首先向目标发送邮件提供亚马逊的工作机会，后续通信中发送了包含了 IP 地址和登陆凭证以及木马版的 PuTTY 的文件。攻击者诱骗受害者打开文件运行木马版本以进行技能评估。但该版本含有恶意载荷，会部署和安装后门程序。


消息来源：Mandiant



老王点评：PuTTY 是一个小巧而流行的 SSH 客户端，但是一定要使用一个干净的。很多人在临时使用 SSH 时，都会去网上随便搜索一个 PuTTY 下载使用，这种往往是有木马的。




LastPass 表示在驱逐前已被入侵内部系统 4 天

今年 8 月，LastPass 被入侵，入侵者使用多因素身份验证成功通过了身份验证，从而访问了内部开发环境。但 LastPass 表示，“系统设计和控制阻止了威胁行为者访问任何客户数据或加密密码库”。这很可能是因为只有构建发布团队才能将代码从开发环境推送到产品环境，而它们是“物理分离，没有直接连接”的。

老王点评：虽然入口被突破，但是内部损失有限，这说明良好的内部 IT 环境还是相当重要的。</span>

If you own and use a smartphone capable of connecting to arbitrary computers all over the world, then you are a user of Radio Access Networks (RAN). A RAN is provided by your cellular provider, and it handles wireless connections between your smartphone and your communication provider.
While your smartphone may be running an open source operating system (Android) and the server you try to access is probably running Linux, there&#x27;s a lot of proprietary technology in between to make the connection happen. While you may have a basic understanding of how networking works locally, this knowledge stops when you plug a SIM card into your smartphone in order to make a connection with a cell tower possible. In fact, the majorit…</span>

                              <span>Greetings Hunters!

We are proud to finally be able to share FlexPDF with you 🎉 🥳! We developed this tool to help publishers convert PDF files to responsive HTML with just a few clicks.

FlexPDF&#x27;s main target audience will be PDF publishers (magazines, catalogs, brochures, books, guides, etc.) that need a solution to move away from static PDF files to responsive HTML as more than 60% of readers today consume content from their mobile devices.

The Challenge:
Existing free tools will convert PDF to HTML, but the results are usually pretty bad for a couple of very important reasons:

1. the HTML code generated is cluttered and not optimized for search engines
2. there is typically no good ways to navigate content in chapters or articles
3. content is still absolute and not responsive, which means it breaks on mobile devices
4. it&#x27;s hard to edit or include interactive things like audio, video and animations
5. the results are typically littered with formatting errors, missing words and broken layouts

FlexPDF is Different!
Our focus is on generating responsive HTML results that look and read great on any device, size and orientation that delivers an excellent mobile experience.

1. the HTML code generated is clean and has the correct syntax 
2. content is separated into chapters/articles and navigation is built into the output including an automatically generated table of contents.
3. content is responsive which means it looks and reads great on any device, size and orientation
4. the output can currently be shared in three main ways. You can download the HTML, use an embed code or share a link. All 100% branded to clients.
5. results are almost 100% error-free 

FlexPDF is Version 1.0
We are launching here on ProductHunt in hopes of getting some feedback to improve the tool even more. We hope you will find a few minutes to try it out and let us know what you think in the comments.

Thanks for all your support. This is a fantastic community!

In my time using iOS 16 so far, I’ve generally been very pleased with the new features and improvements. The customizable lock screen is fun. Removing the background of images just by holding down on a picture’s subject still hasn’t gotten old. But only a few days after the new software rolled out, I’ve already found my biggest frustration: iOS now asks if it’s okay to paste an item from one app to another. Constantly. Over and over and over again. 
There’s got to be a better solution than this.

Lil Nas X has been the “president of League of Legends” for barely more than 24 hours, and he is already cutting up. No longer content as the Lord of Hell, Lil Nas X has relinquished his fiery crown, exchanging it for a desk in the CEO suite of Riot Games. His first executive order? Making a nude skin of Udyr. His second executive order, well... it’s going to make half the population of League players very unhappy.
as the new president of league of legends, bottoms are no longer allowed to play.

There’s also another LoL-flavored tweet from President X that I cannot link here because it will likely trip every not-safe-for-work filter built into this browser and laptop by my employers....

EVGA, a titan in the PC component space, is getting out of the graphics card game. The company posted in its community forum, saying that it won’t be making next-generation Nvidia graphics cards but will continue to sell and support “the existing current generation products.” According to Gamers Nexus, the company doesn’t currently have plans to make AMD or Intel graphics cards.
EVGA is reportedly making the decision to no longer work with Nvidia because it feels the company was a bad partner, according to both Gamers Nexus and JayzTwoCents. The company claims that Nvidia wouldn’t tell EVGA how much it would have to pay to obtain GPU cores before publicly announcing the price of cards like the RTX 3080, which made it difficult for EVGA...

Shopping for a laptop can be stressful — doubly stressful if you or your children will be learning online for the first time. Kids of different ages have a range of different laptop use cases and different needs. And as the choices for best laptop and best Chromebook evolve, so do students’ needs. So I spoke to some experts on the subject: students themselves. 
My recommendations here are meant to accommodate a variety of preferences and price ranges. But they’re a jumping-off point rather than an exhaustive list: every student is different. Before making a decision, you’ll want to make sure you read reviews and try out devices yourself if you can. I’ll do my best to keep this article up to date with items that are in stock.

We’ve all done it: sent a text message and then instantly regretted it. Whether it was a text to your parent with a spelling error that they’d never let you live down, a message with a wrong word in it (“I don’t want to come to the party!” instead of “I want to come to the party!”), or a sudden realization that you just sent your message to the wrong person — it can be embarrassing at the least and disastrous at the worst. 
While messaging apps like Signal, WhatsApp, and Viber all have some version of “delete for everyone,” until now, there was nothing you could do about it on iMessage except to follow it up with an “I didn’t mean that!” message.
In iOS 16, Apple has introduced a feature to its iMessage chat app that allows you to unsend...

Cybersecurity alarm bells have been ringing loudly in the healthcare industry this month. The FBI warned healthcare facilities that medical devices (like patient monitors or infusion pumps) often run on outdated software that could be vulnerable to hacks. OakBend Medical Center in Texas was hit with a major ransomware attack from a gang that says it stole 1 million patient records. A report showed that patients at hospitals dealing with cyberattacks are more likely to die. 
The series of warnings come with a growing awareness of just how dangerous cybersecurity holes in healthcare can be. Healthcare organizations are more and more dependent on internet-connected devices to do things like track patient records and deliver medications. And...

                              <span>在 LPC 2022 大会上，Torvalds 和我有机会坐下来，再次谈论生活、Linux 和潜水。




爱尔兰，都柏林：我认识 Linus Torvalds 已经几十年了，但是自从全球疫情爆发以来，我们已经多年没有机会进行面对面的访谈了。终于，在 2022 年的 Linux Plumbers 大会上，这个世界顶级 Linux 开发者的年度聚会上，我们有机会再次面对面进行了交谈。

在这次会议之前，Torvalds 在荷属西印度群岛的博内尔岛潜水了六天。如果有选择的话，他说他&quot;宁愿潜水也不愿去参加会议&quot;。我们不都是这样吗？

Torvalds 还说，尽管他在 Linux 内核上工作了很多，但他不是工作狂。


真的，我之所以还能年复一年地为之工作，是因为我可以离开它。但我不会离开很久，因为我会感到无聊。唯一让我觉得日子漫长，而且精疲力尽的时候是在一个合并周期开始的时候。即使如此，我还是尽量在我可以集中精力的合并的第一周做完所有主要的事情。


如果你想知道谁是 Linux 内核真正的工作狂，Torvalds 建议你看看 Greg Kroah-Hartmann（GKH），他是 Linux 稳定版内核 的维护者。“我不知道他是怎么做到的，”Torvalds 坦承，“我想他把很多事情都自动化了，但这是无休无止的，而且每周都要做。”

然而，全球疫情对 Linux 内核的开发几乎没有任何影响。当然，Torvalds 和许多顶级内核维护者一样，多年来一直在家里工作。一个大的变化是，“多年来，我们第一次召开了一场面对面的 Plumbers 和 Linux 内核维护者峰会”，这是一个由前 20 名内核维护者组成的圆桌会议。

Torvalds 说，另一个很大的不同是，那些以前没有在家工作的开发者发现，他们很大程度上喜欢在家工作。Torvalds 希望他们中的许多…</span>

在 LPC 2022 上，Linux 创始人 Linus Torvalds 谈到了工作。他说他不是工作狂，在参加这次会议前花了六天时间在玩潜水。他说，他可以一年又一年在内核上工作是因为他可以短时间离开放松下，最筋疲力尽的时候通常是合并开始时，而 Linux 内核社区真正的工作狂是稳定版内核维护者 GKH（格雷），每周都不停的工作。他也介绍了外出旅行时的装备，他使用一台 M2 MacBook Air 笔电，运行 Fedora Workstation 36。Fedora 还没有支持 ARM-64 M2 处理器的版本，他自己动手让 Fedora 36 能运行在 M2 上，这个版本不完美，不支持 3D 图形，Chrome 也不支持。

以太坊合并完成，为全球电力节省了 0.2%

2022 年 9 月 15 日，以太坊准备了 8 年之久的从 PoW 切换到 PoS 顺利完成。此次合并只是对以太坊进行一系列升级的第一步，而接下来还将实施另外四个开发阶段。最终目的是让以太坊的扩展性更好、速度更快、使用成本更低。据报告，此前以太坊网络每年消耗约 2300 万兆瓦时的能源，合并后，可将以太坊的二氧化碳排放总量减少 99.992%。Vitalik 称，这降低了全球电力消耗 0.2%。不过，显然相当多的以太坊矿工转移到了继续采用 PoW 的 ETC 网络上了。

Cloudflare 放弃 Nginx 代理服务器

长期以来，Cloudflare 都依赖于 Nginx 作为其 HTTP 代理堆栈的一部分。但现在，其已替换为由 Rust 编写的自研 Pingora 软件。该公司宣称，Pingora 每日可处理超过一万亿次请求。在提供更高性能的同时，CPU 和内存资源的开销还仅为旧方案的三分之一。不过，Pingora 尚未开源 —— 尽管 Cloudflare 表示其正在制定计划。

                              <span>一个名为 GNU LibreJS 的 Firefox 浏览器扩展程序旨在自动阻止非自由软件的大型 JavaScript 脚本。与 NoScript 相比，GNU LibreJS 的操作也类似。主要的区别特征之一是 NoScript 在默认情况下会阻止大多数 JavaScript 脚本，而 GNU LibreJS 针对的非自由软件的大型 JavaScript 脚本。

GNU LibreJS 源于 Richard Stallman 的一篇名为《JavaScript 陷阱》的文章。Stallman 认为，运行在浏览器上的非自由软件，主要是用 JavaScript 编写的，也有用其他语言编写的。这些应用程序有许多是专有软件或者不开源的，更有甚者其中不乏一些有害的或有问题的程序。Stallman 声称 Google 文档使用的 JavaScript 程序的大小为半兆字节。它是压缩过的，想要理解和分析这样的程序就很具有挑战性。Stallman 将监控用户的 JavaScript 代码称为恶意软件。

Stallman 建议不要运行那些复杂的或非常消耗处理能力的 JavaScript。从外部页面加载的脚本、修改 DOM 的脚本以及对 eval 的调用，都是符合上面描述的 JavaScript 代码的例子。GNU 网站发布了一个（符合上述描述的）列表。当 GNU LibreJS 安装在 Firefox 和其他兼容的浏览器中时，它会为用户做出这些区分。它会启用那些小型的 JavaScript，并阻止它认为非自由软件的大型 JavaScript 代码。

该扩展添加了一个工具栏图标，指示页面上存在多少被阻止的 JavaScript 引用。除了更改整个网站或特定脚本或代码段状态的控件外，单击会显示接受和阻止的 JavaScript。可以将整个网站以及特定脚本或代码片段列入白名单或黑名单。扩展程序会记住之前的设置。提供了显示 JavaScript 代码的选项，以及撤销所有自定义设置或单个自定义设置的选项。

                              <span>Lapce 是一个用 Rust 构建的开源代码编辑器。它正处于早期开发阶段，但看起来很有前途！




有很多开源的代码编辑器可用于 Linux。

你对换一种选择有什么看法：一个专注于性能的基于 Rust 的开源代码编辑器？

它应该是激动人心的，对吗？

Lapce 就是这样一个正在开发的项目，它的目标是开发出一个功能丰富、速度快的代码编辑器，作为微软的 Visual Studio Code 的替代品。

开发者还提到，它的灵感来自于 Xi-editor（它已不再处于活跃开发状态）。

Lapce 处于 pre-alpha 阶段



虽然 Lapce 还不是一个完整的产品，但它有很多东西可以提供。

因此，随着稳定版本的接近，我们得到的东西应该是有趣的。

值得强调的功能包括：


命令面板（快速操作）。

自定义用户界面字体、标题高度、字体阴影、滚动宽度等。

内置终端。

类似 Vim 的模态编辑。

连接到远程计算机。

代码语法高亮，代码不全，以及类似功能。

插件系统。

深色/浅色模式。


虽然它专注于性能，但在用户体验方面看起来不错（尽管它不完整）。



如果用户能够获得一个代码编辑器所期望的所有基本功能，以及一个性能更好的应用，Lapce 很快就会成为一个受欢迎的选择。

下载 Lapce

Lapce 在 Linux、macOS 和 Windows 中有 pre-alpha 版本。

对于 Linux，你只需要下载并解压 tar.gz 包，然后使用 GUI 或终端运行 Lapce 可执行文件。

目前，它正在积极开发中。你可以为你的平台下载软件包并进行测试，但你应该预期会出现 bug 和新的版本。探索它的 GitHub 页面 以获得更多信息。


Lapce


我在 Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 上试用了它，发现用户界面冻结了几次。然而，它所提供的功能似乎令人印象深刻。

                              <span>智能家居。我的理解是：智能的、易用的，能给生活提供极大便利的，才能称之为「智能家居」。
大家好，我是少数派新晋 Martix 作者，目前从事主要以政府项目为主的运营。作为我在少数派潜水多年后的第一篇内容，就是如何利用极低的成本打造属于你的智能家居。
内容背景

本文将以「Home Assistant」智能家居平台（简称 「Home Assistant」，下同），开展工作，并通过 iOS 的 HomeKit 及 Android 自身的设备管理器来控制智能家居配件。关于「Home Assistant」的详细介绍，如何部署及安装插件的教学，少数派已有前辈进行了详细说明，这里不再赘述。

需强调的是，笔者通过 Debian 10 进行部署，版本是 2022.3.8，预装插件与其他方法略有出入。
由于系统过于老旧，「Home Assistant」的 Home Assistant Supervisor 不再支持 Debian 10 ，但使用下来，似乎实际上没有影响。
重复造轮子？

既然前辈已经在少数派中发表了基于「Home Assistant」构建的「智能家居」内容，为何笔者仍然要以此作为在少数派的第一篇内容？不是前辈撰写的内容不好，只是内容方向不同，本文将基于 YAML 语言来定制属于自己的「智能家居」。
本文将尽可能使用通俗的语言，力求做到即使每一位读者未曾接触也不能理解 YAML 语言的情况下能码出自己想要的配置文件，但由于笔者对 YAML 语法也未能做到了然于胸，更多地是一边学习一边进行，涉及到变量的部分无可奉告。
自身情况及案例
自身情况

笔者家中由于入网设备较多，以及需要多网合并带宽等需求，传统路由器性能已无法达到笔者需求，因此家中有一台低功耗服务器作为软路由使用，部署在 VMware 虚拟机中。

所使用网络基于中国电信，配备有公网非固定 IP 和动态域名。

                              <span>近日（2022/9/15）设计圈有个大新闻，Adobe 公布了收购 Figma 的消息：

Adobe 的官方公告
Figma 的官方公告
Figma CEO 的推特

Adobe 决定用 200 亿美元（一半股票，一半现金）收购 Figma，交易还需要获得监管部⻔的批准，预计将在 2023 年完成。
这对于设计界来说是一个爆炸性的新闻，虽然在此前也有征兆，早在去年（2021）Figma 的最早的两个联合创始人之一，与现任 Figma CEO 在大学时期一起创建 Figma 的前 CTO Evan Wallace 从 Figma 离职了，可能在那时就已经决定了 Figma 的命运。
对于这次收购，很多设计师对 Figma 非常的悲观，相比 Figma 而言 Adobe 更像是一个无情的资本机器，收购来的产品鲜有好下场的，上一个 Adobe 收购的界面设计工具 Macromedia Fireworks 已经死在 2013 年了。
Macromedia Fireworks 1.0
而 Adobe 的旧有产品缓慢又迟钝的更新，在设计师群体中形成了 Adobe 就是一头笨拙的大象的印象。在过去，设计师们既不满意又无法逃过 Adobe 的魔掌，Figma 的出现让设计师至少在 UI 设计领域上挣脱了 Adobe 的束缚，可惜即使 Figma 在 UI 设计领域战胜了 Adobe，又拓宽了设计与协作的领域，最终还是被 Adobe 花钱摆平了。
很多设计师对 Adobe 收购最有印象的是 2005 年收购 Macromedia，曾经风靡一时的 Macromedia 产品 Dreamweaver、Fireworks、Flash、 Authorware 几乎都死在了 Adobe 手上，其实 Adobe 的买买买从更早就开始了，Adobe 的代表产品 Photoshop 就是 1995 年收购…</span>

This morning, after returning home from a mini vacation, I decided to run apt update and apt upgrade from the command line just to see whether there had been any updates while I was offline. After issuing the update command, something didn&#x27;t seem quite right; I was seeing messages along the lines of:
W: https://updates.example.com/desktop/apt/dists/xenial/InRelease: Key is stored in legacy trusted.gpg keyring (/etc/apt/trusted.gpg), see the DEPRECATION section in apt-key(8) for details.
True, it&#x27;s just a warning, but still there&#x27;s that scary word, deprecation, which usually means it&#x27;s going away soon. So I thought I should take a look. Based on what I found, I thought my experience would be wor…</span>

                              <span>“
              Hey Product Hunt! 👋

So I recently decided to join Twitter to build a product in public and during my profile creation, I couldn&#x27;t figure out what to use as my cover picture.

Upon further research, I saw a lot of those who were successfully building in public had informative Twitter banners rather than a random background picture of cats.

Their banners explained who they are, what they are building, their current MRR, and their target MRR. Finally, they had a strong Call To Action pointing to the follow button to attract new followers.

I quickly hopped into Canva to create this, but then decided to build a free tool that allows anyone who is building in public to generate these kinds of informative banners. 

I hope you guys enjoy it and feedback and suggestions are always welcome!   

Cheers!

It&#x27;s a bit of a hype term, but the underlying theory is still true: regular online courses aren&#x27;t great (when was the last time you finished one?), and CBC&#x27;s are the future of online learning, with the likes of Maven (founded by Gagan Biyani, formerly founder of Udemy) leading the way.

TL;DR If you want to learn new skills and meet interesting people, use Next Cohort to find a great new course for you!

                              <span>本指南旨在帮助你了解如何在流行的浏览器，如 Firefox、谷歌 Chrome、Chromium 和微软 Edge 中启用深色模式。




我们都喜欢深色模式。许多人喜欢它，而不是标准的浅色模式。虽然许多桌面应用提供了原生的深色模式，但一些应用通过桌面环境的基础模式适应深色模式。

你不能否认，我们都在浏览器上花了好多时间。我们很少使用桌面应用（除非你是在工作，如视频编辑等）。因此，当你在浏览器上花很多时间阅读和学习时，你应该也可以选择深色模式。但是，对于各个浏览器，稍微有点不同。

本指南为你提供简单的步骤，你可以按照这些步骤在 Mozilla Firefox、Chromium、Chrome 和 Edge 浏览器中启用深色模式。

在浏览器中启用深色模式

在 Firefox 中启用深色模式

打开 Firefox ，点击右上角的设置菜单。

点击 “设置Settings &gt; 扩展和主题Extension and Themes”。

选择“深色主题Dark Theme”并点击“启用enable”。然后你应该看到深色模式被应用到 Firefox。





要恢复它，按照同样的步骤，选择浅色主题。

Chromium 和 Chrome 的深色模式

Chromium 或 Chrome 默认不预装任何深色主题。因此，你需要去 Chrome 商店，下载任何你想要的深色主题。在本指南中，我将推荐 “Morpheon Dark” 主题，它有超过一百万用户在使用它。

从 Chromium 浏览器中打开 Morpheon Dark 主题页面（从以下链接）。


Chrome 网络商店中的 Morpheon Dark 主题


点击“添加到 ChromeAdd To Chrome” 按钮。它应该会在 Chrome 中启用。

你可能想探索 Chrome 网络商店中的其他黑白或深色主题。请访问此页面，查看所有的深色主题集合 。

然而，你应该记住一件事：这个主题不会改变设置或上下文菜单。这很明显。因为它只是改变了浏览器窗口，而那些菜单是操作系统本身的一部分（有时）。



对 Google Chrome 也要按照同样的步骤进行。

Edge 浏览器的深色模式

然而，微软 Edge 浏览器 默认带有更好的深色主题。它允许你从设置中使用 GTK+、浅色和深色模式。

打开 Edge 浏览器

点击右上角的三个小圆点。

进入“外观Appearance”，选择“深色Dark”。这就完成了。

这个 Edge 的深色主题实现得更好，因为它改变了上下文菜单和地址栏。



结束语

如果你是一个高级用户，你可能不需要这个指南。你可以搞清楚。

但我们为所有的读者涵盖了所有从基础到高级的教程。许多新的 Linux 用户可能也不知道如何在浏览器中启用深色模式。

因此，话虽如此，我希望这能帮助你和其他人。如果你遇到任何麻烦，请在下面的评论栏里告诉我。

                              <span>DeepMind 研究员论文称 AI 将消灭人类

来自谷歌 DeepMind 和牛津大学的研究人员发表的一篇新论文称，超级智能的 AI “很可能” 会给人类带来生存灾难。这篇论文设想地球上的生命将变成人类与超级先进的机器之间的零和游戏。他们认为，在一个资源有限的世界里，对这些资源的竞争是不可避免的。在未来的某个时刻，监督某些重要功能的高级 AI 可能被激励想出作弊策略，以损害人类的方式获得其奖励。

老王点评：虽然可以按照阿西莫夫机器人三定律的原则设计一些 AI 自限的规则，不过，说到底，还是要让 AI 认为人类的存在是必要的才行。




AI 机器人在论坛模仿发帖，导致用户互相指责对方是机器人

一位 YouTube 主播利用论坛的内容训练了一个 AI 语言模型，并将该 AI 模型用于 10 个机器人程序，然后在 24 小时内发了 1.5 万个论坛帖子。这些机器人虽然偶尔会犯错，但该论坛的用户花了两天时间才注意到问题，并识别出了其中一个机器人账号。机器人账号导致了用户之间的不信任，即使在关闭了这些机器人之后，用户彼此之间仍然会指责对方是机器人。

老王点评：过去是安能辨我是雌雄，现在是谁知道你是不是个机器人呢？




微软 Teams 以明文方式存储授权令牌

安全分析师在微软 Teams 的桌面应用程序中发现了一个严重的安全漏洞，它在 Windows、Linux 和 Mac 中以明文方式存储授权令牌，使威胁者能够访问认证令牌和开启了多因素认证（MFA）的账户。研究人员在 2022 年 8 月发现了这个问题，并向微软报告。然而，微软并不同意这个问题的严重性，并表示它不符合打补丁的标准。由于微软不准备提供补丁修复，专家建议用户改用浏览器版本的微软 Teams 客户端。


消息来源：BleepingComputer



老王点评：或许微软有自己的逻辑，不过微软这种否认后再提供补丁的事情也不少。

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://linux.cn/article-15033-1.html?utm_source&#x3D;rss&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;rss">

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>经过两年的发展，自由开源的照片编辑器 PhotoDemon 的作者已推出了 PhotoDemon 9.0。新版本增强了用户界面，内置了对 Adobe Photoshop 插件的支持，支持了新的图像格式，减少了资源使用等等。根据用户在 “工具Tools &gt; 选项Options &gt; 更新Updates” 下的设置，已经安装了 PhotoDemon 9.0 可以自动收到更新推送。你也可以选择通过 “帮助Help &gt; 检查更新Check for Updates” 手动更新。

PhotoDemon 这个便携程序提供压缩包下载。解压到系统，就能启动这个照片编辑器。可能最新版本会让Windows 可能会发出 SmartScreen 警告，VirusTotal 上的两个不太知名的杀毒软件也会报毒（以上都是误报）。新的 PhotoDemon 消耗的资源比以前的版本少，这是它的优点之一。例如，它在冷启动后使用的内存也比以前的版本少 12%。

用过老版本的用户切换到新版本可能会立即注意到新的界面。比如大多数选项现在都以弹出的方式显示，最常用的工具显示在工具栏上。根据作者的说法，新的用户界面使用了“旧版本不到一半的垂直空间”，而且不会牺牲功能。

用户界面仍然可以适配各种显示分辨率，包括 1024×768 这样的传统分辨率。且新版本中打开的照片会有更多空间。在早期的版本中，照片编辑器的选择工具表现出色。最新版本中包含对多选区的支持。添加选区、减去选区和相交选区可用于组合选择，即使在多个选区处于活动状态时，你仍然能编辑刚创建的选区。

内容填充工具，通常称为智能对象移除或涂抹，是另一个新功能。要使用它，用户可以选择 “编辑Edit &gt; 内容填充Content-aware fill” 或 “选择Select &gt; 修复选区Heal selected region”。虽然该工具是自主操作的，也能个性化一些设置和选项。该功能既不需要人工智能也不需要互联网连接。事实上，正因为如此，如果多次运行该工具可能会带来更好的图片。

PhotoDemon 9.0 支持新的图像格式。新版本提供 PSP 图片、AVIF 和动画 WebP 图像的导入和导出功能。尽管有 AVIF 支持，但由于其大小，并未内置必要的编码器和解码器应用程序。用户首次加载或保存 AVIF 文件时会下载必要的数据。现在可以导入 XCF（GIMP）、SVG 和 SVGZ 格式的图像。

最后但同样重要的是，PhotoDemon 9.0 支持无损 “quite OK”（QOI）照片、Symbian 图像（MBM 和 AIF）、漫画书档案（CBZ）和无损 JPEG（JPEG-LS）图像。作者称最新版本中的自动优化 GIF 的功能是同类产品中最佳的。新的神经网络颜色量化器也有助于依赖调色板的图像格式。

PhotoDemon 9.0 的新增增强功能包括：


图像调整器提供了 12 种复杂的重采样技术的实时交互式预览。

支持内置的 Adobe Photoshop 插件（8bf）。

完全支持 3D LUT（三维查找表）。

新效果包括渐变流、凹凸贴图、Droste 和 Truchet 贴图。

改进了结晶和染色玻璃的工具。

一种新的去雾工具，用于恢复“被雾霾或雾霾破坏”的照片。

新的用户界面和改进的工具性能曲线。

为了“更好地匹配 Photoshop 的实现”，照片滤镜工具已经过重新设计。

                              <span>树莓派操作系统更新，增加了对 NetworkManager 支持以及新的操作快捷方式。




如果你是小型迷你计算机的狂热粉丝的话，你可能知道树莓派可以用作成熟的桌面计算机使用。此外，它也是支持各种电子/物联网项目的核心组件。

虽然许多 Linux 发行版为树莓派提供了镜像文件，但树莓派基金会仍然提供了其官方操作系统，即 树莓派操作系统Raspberry Pi OS。

顺便说一句，树莓派操作系统是基于 Debian 的。具体来说，当前版本是基于 Debian 11 Bullseye 的，它是采用 LXDE 作为桌面应用环境的轻量级操作系统。

树莓派操作系统：带来了什么最新内容？

尽管这个最新的更新并不是一个重大更新，但它仍然带来了一些有用的补充。如果你把树莓派用作桌面计算机来使用，你一定会欢迎它的。

让我们来看看新版本提供了什么。

主菜单的快速搜索功能

虽然 Windows 系统和许多 Linux 发行版已经包含了这个基本功能，但树莓派操作系统之前一直没有这个功能。

用户可以点击“树莓派”图标或键盘上的默认主机键，打开主菜单，键入要启动的应用程序的名称，就会自动出现一个新的搜索框。

可用向上和向下箭头键来浏览菜单，用回车键选择应用。



如果用户不键入任何内容，则主菜单的功能与点击“树莓派”图标以显示应用程序时的功能完全相同。

再也不需要用鼠标光标来打开应用程序了。

全新的键盘操作快捷方式

就像主菜单一样，你还可以通过键盘打开 Wi-Fi 和切换蓝牙功能。

按下 Ctrl+Alt+W 将打开 Wi-Fi 菜单，而 Ctrl+Alt+B 是用于蓝牙的。

增强型音频输入控制

任务栏现在将为输入和输出设备显示两个单独的图标，而不是单个默认音量图标。



每当连接音频输入设备时，扬声器图标旁边也会弹出一个麦克风图标。此外，如果连接了多个音频输入设备，用户可以右键单击该图标从列表中选择设备，而左键单击将显示音量控制滑块。

支持 NetworkManager

NetworkManager 是许多 Linux 发行版用来处理网络功能的流行的守护程序。它包括许多功能，可帮助用户相应地调整和配置网络设置。

如果你想进一步了解，请在此处了解有关 Linux 中守护程序的更多信息：


什么是 Linux 中的守护进程？为什么使用它们？


就其功能而言，引入了对 NetworkManager 的初步支持，以作为 dhcpcd 的替代选项。这意味着用户可以轻松管理 VPN 连接，而不会有太多麻烦，甚至可以将树莓派配置为一个 Wi-Fi 接入点。




请注意，NetworkManager 的支持应该还在测试中。为了获得稳定的网络体验，建议用户继续使用 dhcpcd。

如果你仍然想尝试 NetworkManager，则需要遵循一些高级步骤。但可以放心，如果在使用 NetworkManager 时遇到任何问题，可以选择切换回 dhcpcd。


如果你想了解有关该版本的更多信息，官方发行说明 包括了更多详细信息。

获取树莓派操作系统

前往下面链接的官方下载页面下载新的镜像文件。


获取树莓派操作系统


你可以在任何系统上使用树莓派 Imager 来制作要在树莓派上使用的 microSD 卡。不管如何，你都可以单独下载树莓派操作系统文件进行设置。

                              <span>如果你到了一个陌生的地方旅游，你会选择哪种方式？

方式一：去名胜古迹，或被证明过很好玩的地方打卡；
方式二：随机开车，走到哪儿就在哪儿玩。

我是属于比较保守的那类人，我会选择第一种，这样感觉更保险。但是我住在加拿大的姨娘选择的是第二种。下面这个是她的朋友圈：

随机点地图的出行方式让我心生艳羡，于是评论道「特别好」。
但我想很多人，包括我在内，都会觉得这种靠随机点地图就走的方式比较冒险，就像去到一家陌生的商场里，会先通过大众点评的评级进行一轮筛选，然后再去看对应店家下的评论，最后确定在了一家网红餐厅上。
这种由别人构建出的无形的价值系统，会让我们不自觉地去遵从，我把这种价值系统称作「体裁」。
拧巴、纠结、焦虑，都可能是因为你身处的体裁与你的内在目标产生了矛盾。我想通过这篇文章，疏通一下你的「自我拧巴」情绪。
一、体裁与规则
体裁原本指的是「一切艺术作品的种类和样式」。一个表现形式，只有在特定的场景中，才会发挥应该有的意义。
赵衡毅在《趣味符号学》里说1：

所有的符号文本，都从属于一定的体裁，体裁是一种符号发出者与接收者都接受的一个文化契约，在契约中，符号的发送者与接收者互相限制对方的自由，但是增加了效率。

比如，小说和说明书就是不同的体裁，两者都有对应的呈现形式。而对于读者而言，看小说可以不用当真，但是看说明书需要一板一眼地照着指示来改变现实。
在看一本书之前，先知道它属于什么体裁，就能提高你和作者的沟通效率。再比如谍战人员之间秘密传输的暗号，就需要严格按照对应的体裁规范，去生成信息和解析信息。
体裁如果延伸到我们的生活方式里，它就是某一个群体约定俗成的潜规则。这些规则会束缚着我们的思想和行为。群体有大有小，小到某一个兴趣社群，大到社会性别的约束。

                              <span>Part 0 引入
众所周知，Watch 有两种视图。第一个是「列表视图」，第二个则是「蜂窝视图」。我第一次用蜂窝视图的时候觉得这种交互模式非常炫酷，但是用了一段时间后的感受是 —— 「就像把杂货箱的东西全部倾倒出来，然后直到找着这一次需要的东西」。这无疑是一个非常糟糕的体验，因为每一次找 App 都要反复体验一下找杂物的难受感。所以这里触发了一个痛点是：「买完 Apple Watch 之后，我们应该如何快速找到并打开目标 app 呢？」
回忆一下小时候混乱的工具箱
本篇文章的前提 —— 在抛除了「Siri」、「程序坞」、「表盘上的快捷入口」三种检索方式的基础之上，再来探索有没有办法可以进一步提高效率，让我们的「应用菜单」也可以具备更强的检索性，做到井井有条。
Grid View（网格视图，我也喜欢称为蜂窝视图）
Part 1 思路总括
一开始我是换回了习惯的「列表视图」，依靠皇冠的转动来找到 App。但是列表视图有个问题是 —— 你无法调整 App 的显示顺序。就算你可以调整并分类 App，你也有可能需要在「单向」上线性地浏览众多的 App 之后才能找到目标，
List View（列表视图）
所以思路开始清晰起来 —— 如果我们把应用进行分类，并从中心延伸到几个不同的方向，就可以减少查找的时间和查找的路径长度。基于此，我们利用蜂窝的特性，从中心恰好可以切割出 6 条大方向，代表 6 个大类，然后把最主要的 App 直接放到 6 条线上。相当于至少提高检索速度 6 倍。

Part 2 和我一起来分类
现在，请大家停下 1 分钟，和我一起思考：我的 Apple Watch 上大致都有哪些 app 呢？对于我而言，我会分为以下 6 大类（逆时针），然后把最常用的放到线上：

健康
运动
音乐·声音
办公·社交·信息
支付
其他工具

近期，微信因推出输入法再次冲上热搜，由于越使用占用空间越大，又一次激起了人们对微信「小而美」的调侃。
为什么微信越来越臃肿了？在过去十一年来，微信是如何一步一步成为一个超级 APP 的？为了了解背后的发展故事，我作了此文加以梳理。研究中国最大的社交软件的发展史，其实也是研究过去十几年来简中移动互联网的变迁过程。也是试图解答一个徘徊许久的疑问：这些在摇滚精神和改革开放理念下成长的一代人，简中世界互联网的掌门人，作为新中国历史以来最成功的阶级上升案例，又是如何一步一步，从勇者变成恶龙的。

老大哥在看着你
在 1984 的开篇有这么一句话：无论你走往哪个方向，总有一双眼睛跟着你。Big Brother is watching you.

如今，无论身处何时何地，只要打开手机，也有一双眼睛在看着你。
船票：新大陆与旧秩序
今年是世界末日后的第十年。在今天，很多人可能并不了解或已经遗忘了 2012 的含义。但在十年前，桌面互联网发展的高峰之时，新兴媒体里关于世界末日的讨论贯穿了 2012 年始末。2012 贴吧也是那一年里最热门的百度贴吧之一。有人发帖说自己变卖了全部家产，准备在末日到来前玩个痛快。
风靡一时的 2012 贴吧
待到末日论调随新年钟响而息鼓偃旗，人们发现生活还要继续；曾以为世界将有很大的变化，然而现实来临时却总是似是而非，但未来的确将有所不同。
2011 年，采用三明治架构的、被视作时代经典的 iPhone 4 进入中国市场；同年，iPhone 4S 在乔布斯逝世前一天发布，被喻为乔布斯的遗作，引起了热烈的抢购和黄牛加价。「割肾换爱疯」的梗也从那时流传开来。十月份，《乔布斯传》中文版上市，成为当年排行第一的畅销书，销量甚至力压了当时常年霸占销冠、各有新书的韩寒和郭敬明。在一篇《萌芽》杂志对韩寒的…</span>

One day in March of 2020, a few of my Opensource.com teammates and I grabbed lunch to talk about how we would work from home for the next couple of weeks until this pandemic got nipped in the bud. At the end of the work day, I packed up my laptop and walked out the door of our office building. Several months later, we were all still working from home. None of us had returned to our office-based workstations. In July 2020, using safety precautions, we were granted access to our workstation solely to retrieve personal items. My desk was left exactly as I left it that afternoon in March. Expiring snacks stashed in my secret drawer. Picture frames collecting dust. Comic strips pinned up.

DDEV is an open source tool that makes it simple to get local PHP development environments up and running within minutes. It’s powerful and flexible as a result of its per-project environment configurations, which can be extended, version controlled, and shared. In short, DDEV aims to allow development teams to use containers in their workflow without the complexities of bespoke configuration.
DDEV replaces more traditional AMP stack solutions (WAMP, MAMP, XAMPP, and so on) with a flexible, modern, container-based solution. Because it uses containers, DDEV allows each project to use any set of applications, versions of web servers, database servers, search index servers, and other types of sof…</span>

The typical setup for Internet connectivity today is for your home to have a router, usually a little physical box located somewhere in your house, that acts as a gateway to the rest of the world. The router creates a local network, and you connect your devices to it, including your computer, mobile, TV, game console, and anything else that needs to connect to the Internet or to each other. It&#x27;s deceptively easy to think of this setup as there being two &quot;sides&quot; of your router: On one side there&#x27;s the Internet, and on the other, your devices. That&#x27;s an awful colloquial, though, because in reality there&#x27;s an entire worldwide network of computers on one side of your router, and your digital life on the othe…</span>

Bobby Gryzynger

When using a complex Kubernetes operator, you often have to orchestrate Jobs to perform workload tasks. Examples of Job implementations typically provide trivial scripts written directly in the manifest. In any reasonably-complex application, however, determining how to handle more-than-trivial scripts can be challenging.
In the past, I&#x27;ve tackled this problem by including my scripts in an application image. This approach works well enough, but it does have a drawback. Anytime changes are required, I&#x27;m forced to rebuild the application image to include the revisions. This is a lot of time wasted, especially when my application image takes a significant amount of time to build. This also mean…</span>

                              <span>5 月 25 日，少数派受邀参与「2022 年春季飞书未来无限大会」。 在「人与事相互成就」这个话题上，飞书这次又为我们带来了一整套从人事、招聘、绩效到项目管理、应用开发完整覆盖的先进工具，也分享了更多值得我们借鉴和消化的用法。
在这些工具当中，我们对上手简单、功能强大且完全免费的飞书多维表格，其实也有自己的「一套说法」。
虽然不能像大会上提到的那些团队「一张表管公司」，多维表格的确也在过去这段时间里帮我们解决了很多问题：曾经有过这么一段时间，我们的团队沟通工具是 Slack、选题看板放在 Trello、协作文档服务是 Quip、跨组项目进度同步依赖 Teambition、作者运营工作放在微信群……每一处都需要有人花时间和精力去维护，工作群里时不时也会蹦出几条消息提醒老麦，XX 团队服务又该续费了。
飞书多维表格的上线，则让「不花一分钱解决业务需求」成为了可能。如果你没能第一时间观看「2022 年春季飞书未来无限大会」的线上直播，不妨跟随本文一起认识多维表格，看看这套工具在我们的团队中是如何发挥作用的。
首先，它是一张（更好用的）表
接触过 Excel，上手多维表格就已经成功了一半。如果你已经有了原始数据，甚至可以在飞书文档右上角的「新建」菜单里，直接将 Excel/CSV 格式文件导入为多维表格。

能否用好多维表格，另一半因素在于你是否清楚自己的需求，或者说后续如何对表格数据进行加工、处理。和所有优秀的互联网工具类似，飞书也在多维表格的创建流程中提供了海量的模板，既能搜索、也能通过左侧导航分门别类进行筛选，成员分工、项目管理、分销记录、防疫报备、周报月报……下次同事按耐不住剁手的冲动想要续费什么团队服务之前，先打开多维表格的模板用他念叨的那些关键字搜搜看？

当然，我们将多维表格和 Excel 类比，最主要的原因在于，和恨不得把所有选项都堆在工具栏的 Excel 不同，…</span>

在我们的会员介绍页面，有三个简单的图形，这背后是产品负责人的设计思考，它代表着一个三角形切割打磨成圆形的过程，其实也完美的诠释了少数派业务与会员服务的关系，以及我们未来的愿景。这套图形也正是会员周边的核心元素，我想把背后的故事讲给大家听听。
超值的六边会员服务
代表着我给会员定制的六个方面的服务，它们分别是专属内容、专属产品、高质社群、定制周边、商品福利、共创增值，逐个给大家讲讲。

专属内容
最近几年，短视频爆发，娱乐内容泛滥，大量的攫取着我们的时间。但我们始终认为，如果想让工作和生活变得更好，单靠娱乐远远是不够的，我们需要持续的学习和成长，持续的创新和创造，而深度图文+语音对谈，依然是承载这类内容的最佳方式。而这些经验和思考类内容，稀缺性强，生产成本也高，且很难获得广告支持，会员服务将支撑我们长期深耕这些内容，不断扩展领域，让会员用户跟我们共同成长。

比如一份针对用户消费领域的深度报告内容，制作周期可能长达数月，目前已经针对机械键盘、显示器、咖啡、录音设备等领域推出了这类消费报告。帮助大家全面完整的了解这些产品和用法。
专属产品
我们几乎开发了一套完整的会员产品模块，从页面设计、产品功能、用户体系，都在围绕会员进行规划和重构，我们不像以往的互联网公司那样，为了流量去做大而全，而是希望不断提供独特的创新的产品使用体验。

会员用户可以给我们最直接和有效的反馈，更有很多产品从业者，甚至能跟我们一起共创有趣的新模块。除了内容、商品，我们甚至希望联动线下服务。
高质社群
家家都可以做社群，做好社群却很难，少数派本身就是…</span>

得到这台文石 Tab8 实属偶然，起因是一位朋友给我传送了文石可用旧 Kindle 换新设备的 「ok 计划」。俗话说得好，甘当分母总会成为分子，于是我喜提 Tab8，也就有了这篇测评。
注：尽管 Tab8 是用一台旧 Kindle 以及测评本身换得，但是本文内容和观点不经文石干涉。

我和第四台文石
虽然我在去年才亲自掏钱购入一台文石，但由于我对大尺寸电子墨水屏设备的贪恋，和文石的缘分在更早之前其实就开始了。
20 年入职少数派时，派内闲置的一台 Boox Note Pro 让我眼前一亮——这不就是我想要但买不起的那个东西吗！于是立刻占为己有使用了好几个月。彼时文石还未将骁龙芯片纳入使用，采用的是自研芯片，所以——墨水屏设备有的毛病它都有。除了使用自带阅读器 Neo Reader 读 PDF 等本地文件，使用应用市场下载 App 的使用体验都非常糟糕，卡得飞起。但即便如此我还是用它看完了几部《铳梦》，卡顿和闪屏并不妨碍大尺寸的电子墨水屏给我留下了非常良好的阅读体验，只是那时的文石确实让我觉得，这离一台我会自己花三千大洋购入的墨水屏设备着实还有一段距离。
2020 年底，文石将新设备的芯片统一更换为骁龙 6 系。对于手机来说早已过时的芯片在电纸书上来说却非常堪用，于是没过多久我就购入了一台 Boox Note3，至今服役一年有余。在这台设备上，阅读本地文档和手写批注的体验已经非常丝滑，微信读书 E-ink 版本这类优化过的 App 体验感也上佳。但对于更进一步的网页阅读、未针对墨水屏优化的 App，仍只停留在「能用」的程度。

                              <span>白描是一款简单好用的 OCR 文字识别与扫描工具，主要功能有提取图片中的文字，图片表格转 Excel，公式识别，文件扫描，身份证扫描，合成PDF等。现在，白描除了可以在手机上和网页上用，Windows 版本正式发布，支持 Windows 7/8/10/11，目前白描已经包含 iOS、Android、Windows、Mac、网页、小程序多种版本，想在哪用就在哪用。除小程序外，所有平台的会员通用，也就是说，在手机端买个会员，就可以一个账号全平台使用了。

截屏 OCR 识别
首先，白描 Windows 版本最方便的就是截屏识别，App 运行后，会在右下角托盘有个小图标，右键小图标可以有更多操作，比如：截屏识别。

除了通过托盘图标菜单识别，可以在白描设置界面设置截屏的快捷键，识别更高效。

截图后会弹出识别结果页面，左侧是截图后的原图，右侧是文本结果，在识别结果页面可以复制结果，导出 Word 或 TXT 文本。
截图不只是文字识别，还可以公式识别、表格识别

如果是表格识别，在识别结果的部分可以直接导出 Excel，公式识别可以直接复制为 LaTeX 格式。

如果你平常截图识别的种类非常多，又识别文字，又识别表格，又识别公式，又识别二维码，可以在设置里打开自动检测图片类型，软件会根据检测到的类型自动进行相应的识别。
文字识别
除了截屏快捷识别，也可以在主界面中进行操作，在左侧选中图片文字提取，便可以进行普通的 OCR 文字识别，支持单张识别，批量识别，长图也同样支持直接识别。

主界面的文字识别，除了图片格式，也支持直接将 PDF 文件拖入识别，首先软件会将 PDF 的所有页面解析为图片，然后进行识别。

表格识别
主界面左侧切换为表格识别，可以直接将图片中的表格转换为 Excel 格式，无论带线还是不带线的表格都支持。

如果有多个表格，也支持把表格识别为多个工作表（Sheet）。
公式识别
主界面左侧切换为公式识别，可以将图片中的公式转换为文本，复制为 LaTeX 格式。

关于会员
白描手机 App 中购买的会员可以直接在 Windows 版本中使用，在设置页面登录账号就可以了。

点击这里去 白描官网 下载。
关于另一个 Mac 版
白描之前已经在 Mac 的 App Store 中发布了 Mac 版本，此次又发布了一个新的 Mac 版，是一个可以独立下载安装的版本，基本功能和上面介绍的 Windows 版本一样，同样支持截屏识别、文字识别、表格识别、公式识别、PDF 识别，不过他还有另一个功能：让你的 Mac 变成一个 OCR 识别服务器：

如果你会一些编程，又拥有一台 Mac 电脑，想自己实现一个 OCR 的工具，那可以使用白描提供的服务器服务，发挥你的想象力，做出任何自己喜欢的 OCR 识别工具。
这部分如果感兴趣的人多，会考虑单独写一篇文章来介绍服务器模式。

                              <span>中年的汪二眼里已经没有了光，头顶却越来越光，脱贫没脱掉，却脱了发，还和颈椎病斗争了多年，最终还是和颈椎病共存了。
汪二有个儿子，每当小儿写作业的时候，就在后面，天天唠叨抬头。汪二摸了摸硬直的颈椎想：此生因为颈椎没能成为乔布斯，下一代不能在此再折一次啊。

汪二在某宝上买了一些防止小朋友写作业低头的产品，有物理挡着的，有智能硬件提醒的，都不甚理想，小儿要不是完美避开了物理障碍，就是把电拨了。
为了呵护下一代的乔布斯，也为了当代打工人还能为祖国健康工作三十年，幸福生活一辈子！
汪二挥洒着中年程序猿的余晖，花了数月写了一个新的App，它叫顶瓜瓜！
如何使用
打开App，放在桌前手机支架，角度随意，只要能拍到头即可，然后脑袋上会顶个西瓜，姿势不正确的时候，西瓜会掉下来。
 
 
当你低头了，离桌子太近了，歪头了，它会用有多种方式提醒你，屏幕闪烁和语音提醒（可选择鸭子叫，或真人发声），如果你有Apple Watch，手表会振动。

灵敏度松严可调，建议在写作业时调松，用电脑时调严一点。

在公司里，为了打工人在使用时避免被老板当成在玩自拍，App 设计了10几个花式 Animoji 拟我表情头套可选（也可能更像在玩自拍），随着使用时长增加还可逐步解锁更多表情。

除了可以顶西瓜，当然你也可以顶个榴莲、书、花瓶、鸟窝、皇冠等。不要低头！低头皇冠会掉！打碎了贵重的花瓶也不好啊。
除此之外，它也是一个蕃茄钟应用，你可以选择不同时长来使用，完了有完善的统计功能可供日后分析。在App 上可查看当日/月/年/近7日/近30日专注时间，以及不良坐姿统计，数据存储采用 iCloud Private Database ，它仅由你自己可以查看自己的数据，最大化保护你的隐私，并支持多设备数据同步。
小组件
支持 iOS 16 锁屏小组件和 iOS 14 桌面小组件

作为一个AR应用，顶瓜瓜上线的第二天就获得了 App Store 推荐啦！🎉

关于用户隐私
App 使用 iOS 系统的机器学习，完全本地运算，无需联网，你也不用担心衣装不整时使用会被汪二偷看，另外和汪二的其他作品一样，无广告，无事绝不推送，绝不推送，送。。。
支持设备
App 利用了设备的搭载的前置原深感（TrueDepth）相机，需要 iPhone X 或 iPad Pro 11-inch及后续机型才能使用(即支持FaceID)。更多参考：https://support.apple.com/HT209183

                              <span>继 7 月的《PasteNow 2.3 发布：支持 Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴》后，PasteNow 2.4 又带来了一个非常实用的功能，即「将最近一个项目粘贴为纯文本 」。
新特性：将最近一个项目粘贴为纯文本
在 PasteNow 的使用场景当中，复制粘贴文本是其中最常见的一个场景，而其中又有一部分的需求是将富文本以纯文本的形式粘贴出来，或者换句话说就是：去除文本的格式。
PasteNow 一直都有按需去除格式的功能，它可以按纯文本粘贴或原始格式（富文本）进行粘贴。不过这个过程会需要将 PasteNow 的界面唤起，并按下内置的快捷键来达到这个目标。如果需要多次处理较多的文本，处理起来就会相对比较慢了。
于是在 2.4 版本中，针对这一场景，PasteNow 引入了一个新的快捷键，即「将最近一个项目粘贴为纯文本 」。通过设置成自己习惯的快捷键，然后就可以非常迅速地以统一的形式在任何 App 里完成文本的去格式粘贴，这个过程甚至不需要将 PasteNow 的界面呼出来！
举个例子，比如要将一个网页富文本以纯文本形式粘贴至 Word，首先将「Option+Command+V」设置为快捷键后，接下去只需要这样操作：

在 Safari 里按下 Command + C 复制一段网页文本；
来到 Word，直接按下 Option+Command+V，那么这段网页文本就会以纯文本的形式粘贴至 Word 里面。

请看视频演示：
 
 
相信通过新增这个快捷键，PasteNow 可以又快又好地完成纯文本粘贴这一场景的需求。
macOS 版本及 iOS 版本的其他更新
和以往版本一样，每个版本也会带来旧有功能的完善和修复，其他更新有：

调整音效的音量大小，使与系统当前音量匹配；
修复无法复制正在编辑的标题的问题；
修复无法显示其他应用保存的 JPEG 格式图像的问题；
修复 macOS 端修改列表名称后，没有同步至 iOS 端的问题；
修复暗色模式下，在一些白色背景的剪贴板文本下无法显示标题和快捷键标识的问题。

其中 iOS 版本最主要的变化是完善了对 iOS 16 的适配：

修复了在 iOS 16 Beta 版本中，底部工具栏会布局错乱的问题；
修复无法通过搜索标题找到对应项目的问题。

小结
目前 PasteNow 还有很多需求和功能有待去实现，我会继续保持节奏，将其不断完善下去。

I recently experienced another interesting problem in the Linux startup sequence that has a circumvention–not a solution. It started quite unexpectedly.
I was writing a couple of articles while making some updates to my personal copy of my series of books, &quot;Using and Administering Linux: Zero to SysAdmin.&quot; I had four instances of LibreOffice Write open to doing all that. I had three VMs running with VirtualBox to test some of the things I was writing about. I also had LibreOffice Impress open to work on an unrelated presentation. I like to listen to music, so I had one of several tabs in Firefox open to Pandora, my music streaming service of choice. I had multiple Bash shells open using…</span>

It takes more than a blockchain node to build enterprise-grade applications at scale. As a result, developers often find themselves building plumbing from scratch to make their business logic work. The release of Hyperledger FireFly changed blockchain development, offering developers a full stack of tools to build and scale secure web applications using familiar APIs. FireFly’s next-gen platform simplifies development, making it easy to connect across multiple public and private chains while running many use cases simultaneously. Whether you want to build on permissioned chains like Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, or Enterprise Ethereum, or public chains like Ethereum, Poly…</span>

When I was around 5 years old, my father brought home our first computer. From that moment on, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in computers. I haven&#x27;t stopped hanging around them since. During high school, when considering which specific area I wanted to focus on, I started experimenting with hacking, and that was the moment I decided to pursue a career as a security engineer.
I&#x27;m now a software engineer on the security compliance team. I&#x27;ve been at Red Hat for over two years, and I work remotely in the Czech Republic. I&#x27;ve used Linux for about 12 years, mainly Arch Linux and Fedora, but I&#x27;ve also administered Debian, Gentoo, and Ubuntu in the past.

从我们最熟悉的九年义务教育开始，学习就意味着老师发下来新的课本，孩子们对课本的朗读、背诵和课后习题的思考。「课本」是我们最习惯的接触知识的渠道。来到大学，当学习不再来自学校和家长的压力，对专业知识的获取更大程度取决于个人的管理，「课本」就成为了在学术道路上前进最自然的敲门砖。
自大一使用数字化笔记伊始，我就开始钻研如何更好地阅读「课本」。每一门课程推荐阅读的参考书目，最后都通过我的知识处理流程成为我知识仓库的一部分。相应的，作为知识处理载体的 MarginNote 是以书目为主要处理对象进行加工的。我对任一知识的理解，都以文本为土地生长于文本，也正因为如此，它们始终无法脱离文本。当我在想到某一点时，我总会进而联想到这是在书中的第几章、第几节甚至于第几页。
「课本」的章节条分缕析
这恰是因为我所阅读的参考书目，本身为了阐述这一理论时，已经形成一套体系，通过作者对理论的理解串而联之，由目录一览无遗，因此我的学习不过是我对于作者自建知识系统的读取（以及批注）。这使得我对知识的理解方便快捷许多，因为每一知识之间的联系已经植根于文本之中，而我的学习过程更接近于摘下树木结出的果子。
当开始进行理论课题研究后，我就不再能直接参考一套现有的体系，而必须要创造一套「知识系统」，使其能完整地说明这一课题对象的方方面面。只有具有了足够扎实的土壤，也就是与课题相关的足够知识，才能够创造出一棵身形完整的树木。这时候我需要从知识仓库的储备中选择合适的对象，说明其中的联系，哪颗葡萄长在哪根藤上，才能够写出一篇…</span>

Stable Diffusion 的人工智能绘画能力，我在之前已经不止一次给你展示过了。
 
 
目前， Stable Diffusion 的代码和模型都已开源。按理说，每一个感兴趣的用户，都应该正在开心地尝试作画。但是，这种模型执行起来，需要足够的算力支持。前些日子，你还得需要一块专业级 GPU 来运行它。我买不起专业 GPU 怎么办呢？就从 Google Colab 租了云 GPU 来用。为此，还交了钱订阅 Colab Pro 。

而随着最近 PyTorch 对苹果 ARM 芯片支持的完善，你现在完全可以在自己的 M1/M2 Mac 上面运行 Stable Diffusion ，来获得绘图结果了。
想想看，不花一分钱去租或者买 GPU ，就能在本地出图。那岂不是相当于把一个插画师随身携带了？想想都兴奋。
但问题是，在上周，为了实现这个功能，你还需要按照别人提供的详细教程，在本地安装一系列的软件包。但凡在设置上稍微出点儿问题，往往就会让小白用户手足无措。

嘿，我明明只是打算输入文本生成图像，为什么需要达到计算机二级终端命令行操作水平才行？
这个痛点，不只是想尝鲜的新手会有，就连专业人士也会觉得很麻烦。这么多年被图形界面宠坏了，大伙儿早就更习惯了窗口交互。连换个描述语，都要在一行行代码里面做文本替换，不愉快。
今天我偶然看到了一个新的 Github 项目，叫做 Diffusion Bee ，可以有效解决咱们这个痛点 —— 终于，在 M1/M2 Mac 上面，图形界面开箱即用。不需要手动安装依赖、命令行输入参数，更不用对报错…</span>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

在最初打造 work-life balance 的居家空间时，物件的采购上确实更接近科技爱好者的「实用主义」，比如 BenQ 和 Wit 的灯具，极米的投影，甚至是全屋各个插座配置的多口氮化镓充电头等等，从实际体验到购买参考上的价值角度，每一件都很适合作为社区里「新玩意」栏目中的内容进行分享。

但「器材」带来的兴奋很快就会过去，分享欲被时间消解，最近的购买也渐渐转向了那些「谈不上多有用，但就是喜欢」的东西，索性就用一个合集，整理一下最近带回家的「朋友们」。
「红磨坊的舞会」油画&amp;Pantasy 拼奇积木神奈川冲浪里
前段时间的高温天气着实难熬，因为旅行家里空了几天，返沪时才发现在客厅的长杆蜡烛都被融弯，于是下定决心要换上一些「蓝色系」的点缀，试图在视觉上让自己有清凉的感觉。

抱着这样的想法最近频繁逛了市集、旧货仓库和线下家居店，终于找到一副以深蓝色为基色的油画 ——「红磨坊的舞会」（Auguste Renoir Bal du moulin de la Galette）。原作来自法国印象派画家雷诺阿，这一副卡通版本的画家卖家自己也不太清楚，似乎是在某次展览中撤下的作品，尺寸为 150cm x 90cm。第一眼见到就无比喜欢，清爽浪漫的童话感觉很适合用来调和目前客厅的沉闷，秒付款带回家后立刻替换了原先的主装饰画，现在从房间出来一眼就能看到这一簇蓝色，令人身心愉悦。

照片里的另一抹蓝色是之前一同西北旅行的队友寄来的礼物，我们曾相约在未来走遍国内还未涉足的地方，但不久后他就入职了 Pantasy 拼奇积木，这两年屡次邀约都因为工作忙…</span>

我们总是看到这样的例子——当一家软件公司开始做大做强，用户量飞速上涨之后，他们的产品往往就走向一条不可挽回的庞杂之路。开发团队试图用更多的新功能和更大的饼圈住更多用户，越来越臃肿的界面和逐渐扩充的体积也让用着老设备的用户更加痛苦。
不过大厂也并非所有产品都如此不堪，总有一些优质应用，因为顶着「大厂」的帽子让用户望而却步。这篇文章就简单介绍几个由头部开发商开发的小应用，希望这些好产品能得到它们应有的认识。
微软数学：你手机里的数学老师
平台：iOS / Android / 网页

微软数学是一款用来求解数学方程式的 App——但它不止于此。通过拍照、手写或者是键盘输入待求解的方程式，它不仅可以帮你求出结果，还可以查看详细求解过程，必要时还会附加图片，再也不怕答案里的「略」。
书签、历史记录功能都很完善，App 还提供了测验功能，可以根据运算过的方程式生成类似的题目，帮助你巩固知识点。详细的功能我们在之前的 App+1 文章中有过介绍，如果你常常被数学困扰，微软数学可以让你的学习之路更加轻松。此外，Edge 浏览器已经内置了微软数学，你可以在打开含有数学公式的页面时尝试这一功能。
Layout：快捷图像拼贴工具
平台：iOS / Android

Layout 是一款用来拼接图片的 App，开发者是当时推出了多款独立图像编辑应用的 Instagram。Layout 功能简单，操作也很直观，选择图片与给定的拼接模板即可。不过在 Facebook（Meta）再次改变策略后，这些独立应用又都纷纷整合回了 Instagram。2020 年 Instagram 上推出的 Layout 功能就是这款 App 的延伸。
Layout 上次更新停留在 2018 年末，但其体积小巧，功能粗暴，成图迅…</span>

引子
2016年秋季发布会
开头的这段演讲来自于 2019 年的苹果秋季发布会，Tim 在台上说，在苹果创办的这 40 年里，教育深深的植入进了苹果的 DNA。其实回想一下历年来苹果对外的发言，对 DNA 的表述一直是非常谨慎和克制的，尽管苹果做了许多成功的产品，但你很少会听到什么东西构成了苹果的 DNA，在我的印象中只有两个，乔布斯当年说苹果要始终走在科技和人文的交叉口，这算是一个，而 Tim 口中的教育，则是另一个。而今天这期苹果护城河的视频，我们就来聊聊教育。
坦率来说这个话题其实很早就进入了我们的选题库当中，甚至早于创建这个频道，很早之前我跟零号喝酒的时候就聊起过，你作为一个从业者，是没有办法去忽视苹果在这方面的成就的，但同时我们也知道，这注定不是一个迎合流量的选题，客观上来说，教育这个产品的目标用户不是我，可能也不是看视频的你，做这个选题是很有风险的一件事，有可能费了很大的劲，最后数据非常差。但我后来想清楚了，既然说教育是苹果的 DNA，那我们不妨就看看苹果在教育领域都做了什么，从这些动作和体验的细节上，我们也许就能知道，苹果为何而苹果，他到底哪里不一样。这期视频没有竞品分析，可能在一些细分领域苹果还有一些对手，但把苹果所有的投入放在一起时，尤其在国内的大环境下，苹果其实是没有竞品的，这是苹果真正的护城河。那让我们正式开始。
人人能创造

我们从苹果官网开始，把官网拉到最下面看索引的部分，可以很清晰的看到五列，代表苹果在国内的所有业务，其中第四列全部都是 to B 的商业业务，这里你就能看到 Apple 与教育的入口。打开之后你就能看到教育业务线有三个分支——基础教育、高等教育和高校学生。

我先来给大家简单说几句后面两个，这两个大家应该是非常熟悉的。高校学生这个，就是大家最熟悉的教育优惠，页面当中会比较详细的介绍利用苹果产品和配套的 app 都可…</span>

自我介绍和学习内容
第一次在少数派发文，简单介绍下自己。我从事轨道客车研发工作，就职于吉林长春国企大厂。懂得同学应该知道坐标了，不懂但感兴趣的同学欢迎私聊骚扰^_^。虽已毕业多年，因为从事研发工作的原因，还是要学习输入许多新技能和知识。借着少数派“我的数字文具盒”征文活动，作为非“学术”仅“研究”人员的我，也来蹭蹭热度。
本文要和大家分享我在备考剑桥商务英语（下文用“BEC”缩写代替）高级学习备考过程中使用到的几个数字文具。考BEC高级的初衷简单到有些俗气：通过考试，公司每月发1000软妹币的外语补助，每两年需要重考一次。（让大家见笑了）
出于一切为了钱财的本我思想，我开启了BEC的备考通关之路。本文仅和大家分享备考过程中使用的工具（硬件和软件），不涉及到备考应试的相关技巧。我也会整理关于BEC学习及应试方法的文章发在少数派上，感兴趣的同学可以关注一波。

帮我通关BEC的数字文具们
10.5寸ipad pro配合一代apple pencil是我数字文具的基础载体。2018年入手的这一套组合，现在用起来体验依然良好。
数字文具一：GoodNotes
我使用Goodnotes做BEC网课的课堂笔记。电子笔记对于字迹不好且排版混乱人士（是我自己没错了）极其友善。
作为一个写字丑星人，我无论怎么注意排版和字迹，笔记的可读性都差到不行。上学时的课堂笔记混乱到没有人性，每次拿自己笔记复习时，我的内心都无比emo。“记的这些破玩意，鬼才愿意看。哪里来的自信用这么好看的本子呢？还不如随便用张纸，写完就扔来得痛快！”这样的想法从小到大，有过不止一次。
时代在发展，社会在进步！使用电子笔记可以随时调整笔记排版，虽然依然无法拯救我丑恶的字迹，但笔记整体的可读性大大提高。对于解释性的图片、题目、清单等内容，直接截图到笔记中再调整好大小。笔记质量“真的比之前有了一…</span>

本文写于 iPhone 14 Pro 发布当日，会在后续考虑对一些过时的内容进行更新，如有谬误欢迎指正。
在 2022 年，智能手机显然不再是一个噱头十足的产品类别了。但在 Apple 的下一个重大产品类别「Reality」AR 眼镜出现前（或者说成熟前），iPhone 仍然是 Apple 需要全力以赴迭代以吸引消费者更新的产品。而 iPhone 14 Pro 的有趣之处在于：纵然它的硬件特性和我在发布会前预知的几乎完全吻合，我却从发布会前的「不太考虑购入」变成了「计划购入」。

iPhone 14 Pro 之所以能制造这样的反差，说明其主要吸引力不止硬件特性，而是在各种无法被硬件特性所囊括的设计与解决方案里。
事实上，硬件特性和其吸引力的相关程度低，是大部分高端产品的共性。而落实到 iPhone 14 Pro 这个产品上，影响其吸引力最重要的便是交互设计与软硬件协同、为专业用户设计解决方案的能力，以及能让它在部分方面「不思进取」的资本。
通过今天这篇文章，我想分享一下在 iPhone 14 Pro 发布之后的一些杂思，围绕「iPhone 14 Pro 对我们设计『高端产品』的启示」展开。
注：这些杂思中可能有一部分我在曾经讲过类似的观点。然而，想到互联网的随机性让我们每次的表达能触及和启发不同的人，便觉得适当重提一些观点也无大碍（甚至不介意日后继续这样做），看过我此前作品的读者还请多多包涵。
交互设计与软硬件协同
iPhone 14 Pro 上最吸引眼球的便是 Dynamic Island（灵动岛）这个设计。Apple 的这一巧…</span>

                              <span>前言
日本作为工业强国之一，其文具产业量成熟而发达，诸多文具品牌都有百年以上的品牌历史，从早期的仿制和借鉴，到如今堪称原创程度极高、做工精巧细致、设计富有灵感和生活趣味，外观符合现代审美，因而被大家所深深喜欢。
本篇将从品牌+代表现产产品介绍两方面，来和大家详细讲讲日系文具的趣味与实用属性。
国誉

国誉是一家综合的办公类设备供应商，创立于1905年，有极其丰富的文具产品生产线和办公家具产品供应。创始人黑田善太郎先生以封面纸起家，逐步发展成大型纸质品品牌，进而扩展到其它类别文具和家具行业。近年来也收购了多家国内企业，在我国建厂生产文具产品。
购买国誉，还是要以他们的纸品、本册最为代表！
国誉活页本

国誉的活页本堪称是头号招牌，也是率先把活页本灵活收纳+书写的概念引入国内的学生群体，活页结构耐用，多种封面可选，后期还有不硌手的活页结构推出，非常成熟的代表作。

除了结构上的优势，国誉Campus的内页纸质也是非常优秀的存在，设计有不同划线、结构的内页，并且日本进口原纸可能完美双面书写hold住钢笔。
国誉Campus笔记本

不习惯使用活页本的话，可以选择Campus系列下的笔记本，同样使用进口原纸，书写感受和活页本等同，完全hold住各种墨水~
需要注意不要买成国誉子品牌Gambol系列，那个完全国产，虽然价格低，但不如Campus。
国誉自我手账

除了日用向的本子，国誉的自我手账是简易入手账坑的不错产品，有简约耐看的外皮和丰富的内页，可以很好得记录生活~
每年一本，价格不贵~
国誉对开笔袋

极简设计的国誉笔袋也是品牌的热门款，拉链质感非常出色，设计简约耐看，适合中学生和办公一族！除了基础款，国誉还有些立式变形笔袋，基本都可以做到好用且耐用，值得推荐！
国誉空气弹力剪刀

国誉的这款剪刀也是站内神器之一，刃口锋利而耐用，所谓空气弹力是在握持位置增加了两个内握柄，使用感…</span>

七月中旬，我坐在拥挤的旅游大巴上，驶出深圳湾口岸前往隔离酒店。不知道是不是因为空调开得不够大以至于空气有点闷热，我的心情也有些沉闷，全然没有回家的兴奋。其实真要想，原因也很明了，因为自己在香港找工作的尝试失败了。
这篇文章可能会和其他的经验总结有些不一样，因为我是站在一个失败者的角度来回顾和思考这一路上得到的经验教训。为了让自己的尝试有所价值，思考再三，我决定写下这篇文章，希望能帮助有留港工作意愿的朋友。
本文的感受和经验根据我自己和身边朋友同学的亲身经历总结而成。因为经历和社交圈子有限，本文呈现的内容难免不能覆盖现实生活中的全部情况，请各位姑且听之，多有担待。如果有愿意分享自己经历或者想法的朋友，也欢迎留下自己的声音，共同探讨。

专业选择
我认为找工作是否成功包括两个衡量标准：

能不能找到自己想要的工作；
找到的工作在待遇、行业前景、个人发展空间等方面符不符合预期。

我相信主观能动性的力量，但是一个人的成功，除了个人的奋斗，还需要考虑其他的客观因素。我认为找工作并不是从投递简历时才开始，甚至不是准备简历的时候开始的。很大程度上，一个人从事的职业在选择所学专业以及选择学习内容的时候就开始逐渐被决定了，甚至无论最后从事的工作和学习的内容有没有直接的联系。
如果所学专业能更好地匹配当地市场环境和当时大背景的需求，那么找工作确实会显得事半功倍。香港作为一个外向型经济为主导的转口贸易港，如果想要留港工作，那么那些和「钱」字沾边的专业：金融、…</span>
