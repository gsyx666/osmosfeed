Well, we didn’t know this one was coming: they’re making a film about former-mobile-titan BlackBerry, and it’s going to star Glenn Howerton of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia as the company’s co-CEO, Jim Balsillie. According to The Globe and Mail, production wrapped this week, though when exactly the film will hit cinemas is unknown. 
The film, simply titled BlackBerry, is based on the 2015 book Losing the Signal: The Spectacular Rise and Fall of BlackBerry, by journalists Sean Silcoff and Jacquie McNish. According to its blurb, the book focuses on “an unlikely partnership between a visionary engineer, Mike Lazaridis, and an abrasive Harvard Business school grad, Jim Balsillie” — the two founders of Research in Motion (RIM), which...

Samsung is introducing four new gaming monitors at Gamescom today, and they’re the first Odyssey models to have Samsung’s Gaming Hub built in. This gaming hub provides quick and easy access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, and Nvidia GeForce Now game streaming services.
The Samsung Odyssey G70B and G65B are both designed primarily for PC gaming, with the G70B available in both 27- and 32-inch flat IPS options with 4K support at 144Hz and 1ms gray-to-gray (GtG) response times. The G65B is a curved monitor (1000R) with the same 1ms GtG response times, and it’s available in 27- and 32-inch sizes with 1440p support at 240Hz. Samsung doesn’t mention whether the G65B is IPS, VA, or TN, but given its history with curved panels...

Streaming media platform Plex sent out an email to its customers earlier today notifying them of a security breach that may have compromised account information, including usernames, email addresses and passwords. Although there is no sign that the encrypted passwords were exposed, Plex nevertheless is advising all users to change their passwords immediately.
Plex is one of the largest media server apps available, used by around 20 million people to stream video, audio and photos they upload themselves, in addition to an increasing variety of content the service provides to paid subscribers.
“A third-party was able to access a limited subset of data that includes emails, usernames, and encrypted passwords”
The email states, “Yesterday,...

Facebook experienced a bizarre bug on Wednesday morning that filled user feeds with endless posts from celebrity accounts. Multiple Verge staffers who attempted to use the social media network experienced the same issue, where their main News Feed was flooded with minor posts sent to pages for artists like Lady Gaga, Nirvana, and The Beatles. As of 5:15AM ET the issue appears to have been resolved after creating three hours of chaos. 
Users were quick to take advantage of the bug and to send memes to celebrities that they knew would be shared far and wide. One widely shared image I saw on my own feed features a picture of a turkey sandwich with the caption, “If you see this share it to another celebrities Facebook page keep the turkey...

Acer is adding a Chromebook to its Vero lineup, which it says is meant to offer laptop buyers an “eco-conscious” option. Like the (rather disappointing) Windows laptop that came before it, the Chromebook Vero 514 is made using recycled plastics, has a chassis that’s 99 percent recyclable, and comes in packaging that’s 90 percent recycled paper, according to the company. Acer’s press release even suggests that part of the Chromebook’s packaging can be “transformed into a multi-purpose triangular laptop stand,” if you’re loathe to throw anything away.
Before we go over the recyclability, though, let’s quickly go through the specs — it weighs in at just a hair over 3 pounds, which is reasonable for a laptop with a 14-inch screen, and is...

                              <span>Hey there, How are you? In this article, you’ll see the 10 best Google Chrome extensions for developers these extensions will help a lot in coding and will raise your productivity.
We’re going to focus on Google Chrome, as it’s the most popular browser and the one that I use. However, a lot of these extensions are also on other browsers.

The daily.dev is one of my favorite extensions. Every time you open a new tab, this extension will show you the most popular articles about programming and new technologies.

The BlockSite extension will block the websites that distract you.
In my opinion, Notion is the best productivity tool so if you are using it you should use this extension Notion Web Clipper with it you can save any page on the web to your Notion workspace.

Gdy rozpoczynałam swoją karierę w IT, spytałam jednego ze swoich mentorów dlaczego poświęca swój czas na prowadzenie warsztatów i wykładów oraz dzielenie się wiedzą z innymi. Odpowiedź, którą usłyszałam inspiruje mnie do dziś:
“Dobrych programistów od tych wybitnych dzieli to, że pierwsi doskonale orientują się w kwestiach technicznych, potrafią rozwiązywać problemy i dbają o swój rozwój. Drudzy oprócz tego dzielą się wiedzą i pomagają rozwijać się innym”.
Bardzo mocno wierzę w to, że swobodny przepływ wiedzy, pomaganie sobie nawzajem i wymiana doświadczeń to rzeczy, dzięki którym IT jest tak wspaniałą i wyjątkową branżą. Sama też wiele nauczyłam się dzięki różnym prezentacj…</span>

I am using the Next.js repository so you need to install that, if you are new to it, here is the link to get started.
https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/you-really-need-to-migrate-to-next-js-ee646a9982ab
Once the repository is installed, we will deal with serverless functions(If new), followed by adding the following code to the serverless function.
import fs from &quot;fs&quot;;
const filename &#x3D; &quot;/portfolio/index.html&quot;;
module.exports &#x3D; async(req, res) &#x3D;&gt; {
 res.setHeader(&quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;text/html, charset&#x3D;utf-9&quot;);
 res.write(await fs.readFileSync(filename, &quot;utf-8&quot;));
 res.end();
};

Adding an HTML file is the third step.

    
Example
    
This is an example of a simple HTML page with one  paragraph.
 {
 rewrites: async () &#x3D;&gt; [{
  source: &quot;/public/portfolio/index.html&quot;,
  destination: &quot;/pages/api/portfolio.js&quot;,
 },],
}

Now our profile.html route will simply render an HTML file.
That&#x27;s it for today, until next time, have a good, day.

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy to tell you that the Cherrybomb version 0.7 open source tool for validating application programming interface (API) specifications is now available.
The tool for validating APIs can now be part of your CI pipeline, Your life will become much simpler as a result.
Cherrybomb is a comprehensive, open-source API definition that simplifies the design, construction, and consumption of application programming interfaces (APIs) for software developers. Everything from data formats and request methods to error handling and authentication is covered within the standard.
We wanted Cherrybomb to be simple, both to understand and to use, so we created it that way. Since the specification is mostly based on already-established standards like the JSON API and HTTP, it should be easy for developers to adapt to the new environment.
I believe that Cherrybomb will make it simpler for developers to construct application programming interfaces (APIs) that are standardized, well-documented, and straightforward to implement. We have high hopes that Cherrybomb will emerge as the industry standard for application programming interface (API) development.
Check out the specifications for Cherrybomb on GitHub if you want to get started with it.</span>

                              <span>I am very excited to be your host and at the same time your tour guide. You are welcome to the VPC hotel here at AWS. In view is a map to visually aid our imagination and guide us during the course of this trip.

Let me start by showing you how to find your way around in case of any unforeseen incidence. First and foremost, we have two sections here at this VPC and we refer to them as AZ. On your way here you passed the very secure gate, Aws staffs calls it IGW, but I prefer the full name internet Gateway. The strength of the IGW is what we bank on and it&#x27;s the only way in or out of this VPC. Only authorized users can access it and you can see it&#x27;s location on the map.
Moving on, is the receptionist office, there will see a nice lady who&#x27;s an expert in multitasking and she also makes sure …</span>

                              <span>@angelika_bitsens, decided to launch our first mobile app.  We’ve made a product that will help you to always remember about important events in their lives, that Facebook doesn’t know about 🤙. 

Now you will always remember to send flowers to your Granny’s birthday, or to congratulate your love on the 100 day since your first kiss, or to track your 10th non-smoking day. You may also set a reminder to vaccinate your pet or to water your plants.

Days Counter is a simple yet valuable tool that will help you maintain stronger relationships keeping you reminded of important dates❤️. 

Would be happy to hear your feedback and thoughts.
Cheers!

                              <span>Linux cheat 命令是一个实用程序，可以用来搜索和显示你想要使用的命令的使用示例。




互联网上有很多关于 Linux 和开源的信息，但是当你想要深入工作，通常需要一份便捷的文档。早在 Linux 出现之前的 Unix 系统中，就有 man（“manual” 的缩写）和 info 命令了，二者都会显示命令、配置文件、系统调用等的官方项目文档。

关于 man 和 info 页面是对知晓如何使用工具的用户的有用提醒，还是为初次使用的用户提供介绍存在争议。不管怎样，man 和 info 页面介绍了工具以及如何使用该工具，很少涉及特定任务以及如何完成它们。正是出于这个原因，开发了 cheat 命令。

例如，设想你想不起来如何 解压 tar 压缩包文件 。man 页面会给你展示所有的选项，但需要你将这些信息转换为命令：

tar -A [OPTIONS] ARCHIVE ARCHIVE
tar -c [-f ARCHIVE] [OPTIONS] [FILE...]
tar -d [-f ARCHIVE] [OPTIONS] [FILE...]
tar -t [-f ARCHIVE] [OPTIONS] [MEMBER...]
tar -r [-f ARCHIVE] [OPTIONS] [FILE...]
tar -u [-f ARCHIVE] [OPTIONS] [FILE...]
tar -x [-f ARCHIVE] [OPTIONS] [MEMBER...]


这确实是一些用户需要的，但是也使一些用户感到困惑。相比之下，cheat 命令会罗列常用命令：

$ cheat tar

# To extract an uncompressed archive:
tar -xvf /path/to/foo.tar

# To e…</span>

因此，默认情况下，GNOME 会为你提供几组预配置的浅色和深色壁纸。

但是，如果你想要在主题更改时可以自动更改的别的壁纸怎么办？

以下是在 GNOME 中为浅色和深色主题配置和创建自定义壁纸的方法。

如何为 GNOME 创建自定义浅色和深色壁纸

首先，确保有两个版本的壁纸。通常，它们应该是标准的 PNG 或 JPG 图像。例如，我们在演示中使用了以下两个壁纸。



但是，如果你没有合适的浅色和深色壁纸，或正在寻找更多壁纸，在本指南的末尾，我会告诉你如何获取它们或准备你自己的。

跟着我来。

其次，我们需要为自己创建一个模式文件。壁纸的自动更换由名为 adwaita.xml 的 XML 文件处理，该文件定义了特定的浅色和深色背景标签。因此，我们将为壁纸创建 XML 文件。

为此，从 GitLab 复制 adwaita.xml 的内容并创建一个新的 XML 文件（链接在下面）。你应该在这个文件中看到两个标签：filename 和 filename-dark。这两个 XML 标记包含两个壁纸的完全限定路径。在这两个标签下添加图片的路径，如下所示。


从这里下载 XML 文件 (adwaita.xml.in)




第三步，使用你想要的任何名称将此文件保存到 /home/YOUR_NAME/.local/share/gnome-background-properties（请将 YOUR_NAME 替换为你的用户名）。如果 gnome-background-properties 不存在，请创建它们。对此示例，我使用了 my_cool_backgrounds.xml。



都准备好了。最后，打开设置并转到外观选项卡，你应该会看到选项中出现新的壁纸。

选择你的自定义浅色和深色壁纸并享受。



如何下载或制作你的动态壁纸

你一定会想，“谁有时间去寻找和创建深浅版本的壁纸”？一些网站为你提供现成的动态壁纸，你可以轻松下载和安装。

我推荐的一个网站是 dynamicwallpaper.club，它为 macOS 提供了一些高达 6K 的优秀高质量壁纸。你可以轻松下载它们。

此外，如果你打算从上述网站下载，请记住该网站的图像是 heic 格式，因为该网站适用于 macOS。高效视频编码（HEIC）是 Apple 的 HEIF（高效图像文件格式）的专有版本。

你需要一个驱动来查看和转换 Ubuntu 或 Fedora Linux 中的动态 heic 图像。那么，如何将它们转换为适用于 Linux 系统呢？打开终端并运行以下命令来安装驱动。

Ubuntu 用户：

sudo apt install heif-gdk-pixbuf


Fedora 用户：

sudo dnf install libheif


仅适用于带有 KDE Plasma 的 Fedora/Ubuntu（没有此插件，Plasma 应用无法打开 heic 图像）：

sudo apt install qt-heif-image-plugin
sudo dnf install qt-heif-image-plugin


最后，使用你喜欢的图像查看器打开 heic 图像并将其保存为 JPG/PNG。



最后，别忘了在下面的评论部分告诉我你是否可以为 GNOME 创建自定义深色和浅色壁纸。

干杯。

Whether attending conferences or reading blogs, I often hear several misconceptions about sudo. Most of these misconceptions focus on security, flexibility, and central management. In this article, I will debunk some of these myths.
Many misconceptions likely arise because users know only the basic functionality of sudo. The sudoers file, by default, has only two rules: The root user, and members of the administrative wheel group, can do practically anything using sudo. There are barely any limits, and optional features are not enabled at all. Even this setup is better than sharing the root password, as you can usually follow who did what on your systems using the logs. Howe…</span>

Apache ShardingSphere 5.0.0-Beta version with DistSQL made the project even more beloved by developers and ops teams for its advantages, such as dynamic effects, no restart, and elegant syntax close to standard SQL. With upgrades to 5.0.0 and 5.1.0, the ShardingSphere community has once again added abundant syntax to DistSQL, bringing more practical features.
In this article, the community co-authors will share the latest functions of DistSQL from the perspective of cluster governance.
ShardingSphere clusters
In a typical cluster composed of ShardingSphere-Proxy, there are multiple compute nodes and storage nodes, as shown in the figure below.

Notion、Obsidian、Logseq、Roam Research、Evernote、flomo、为知、飞书、语雀……知识管理/笔记软件越来越多，我总在不同应用间徘徊。直到有次忽然醒悟，知识管理软件不是管理知识，而是管理笔记。笔记里的知识并不属于你，只有经过消化、应用，才会成为自己的知识。
这么简单的事，我之前却一直没看透，总是把笔记与知识理解划上了等号。当要用到曾摘录的笔记时，就在各类知识管理软件里翻找，折腾一番才找到需要的笔记，有时甚至出现「自己不清楚放在哪里，也不清楚是否有」的情况。记笔记花了一个小时，下次寻找与重新消化又花了一个小时，原本为效率而生的知识管理软件变成了浪费时间的杀手。
另一方面，我们在用知识管理软件的美观界面和强大功能的同时，也被这些软件所限制，无法完全按自己的想法输出笔记。比如，你长了一双翅膀，Markdown 文本是自由的天地，而进入 Notion 则被隔成一个个小房间，你在房间里待着很舒服，可一旦想去其他房间，就必须脱离 block，不比 Markdown 可以自由飞翔。

突破迷思后，我基于 VuePress 和 vuepress-theme-hope 建立了 LearnData 项目，把知识笔记、生活记录、博客和任何觉得有价值的记录转成 Markdown 文本，然后推送到 GitHub 生成 Pages 静态页面，同步到国内云服务器形成 LearnData - 开源学习笔记。

LearnData 的笔记/文章编辑均使用 Markdown，输出不再受到应用的局限。同时，LearnData …</span>

2022年是新能源车国补的收尾年，随着销量提升，纯电新能源车品牌不断增多，可选性逐渐增大，价格也不断攀升。 

新能源车最完美的使用环境就是有家用充电桩的日常通勤，享受每公里0.05元以下的电费成本，每天到家就能补足电量，即不产生里程焦虑，也极大程度降低出行成本。
早年新能源车标配充电桩，如今随着价格的提高，充电桩成为了重点阉割项目，不说早早就卖8000的特斯拉，今年的小鹏、问界、沃尔沃都不再赠送充电桩，未来越来越多的厂商会加入这一行列。
7KW充电桩或成为未来主流
虽然我个人认为家用申请380V电表，安装21KW充电桩是拓展性最好的极优解，但目前随着环境的改变，未来大部分国人的家充桩都会是220V 7KW的家用桩。 

首先是电网的审批层面，上海地区的国家电网已经于今年停止了380V充电桩电表的新装报批，目前国网只为新能源车主开放220V电表，最大功率7KW的申请渠道。
这是因新能源车增多而出现的必然趋势，国内未来势必会逐渐取消380V电表用于充电。 

第二是对于交流充电而言，家用充电桩是带有保护装置的连接件，充电过程发生于车载充电机，最快交流充电速度由充电机决定，目前国内在售交流充电速率最高的是16KW，搭载在Model S与Model X两台百万级豪车上，一般大众款新能源车，没有这样的高功率电机。 

理想、威马、蔚来、比亚迪、埃安、荣威等主流的新能源车品牌的核心车型，基本都是内置7KW充电机，不支持11KW三相电来交流充电，所以对于很多车主，7KW充电桩已经是顶配了。
最后是7KW交流充电的表现，以谷时点8小时计算，可以为车辆补充56度电，目前市面大部分家用中小型纯电新能源车的能耗在每度电6~7公里，折算一夜谷时可以补电300~350公里，完全可以狠狠开上一整天。

Avatar: The Way of Water is set to release this December, but it has a pretty major problem: it’s a sequel to a film that came out 13 years ago. Meanwhile, most of us can barely remember what happened on last week’s episode of She-Hulk — when Avatar 2 hits theaters, there could be a lot of confusion if characters start talking about unobtanium, Toruks, RDA, or the Noble Clyde Boudreaux. (One of those things isn’t actually in the movie — see if you can guess which one.)
James Cameron and crew, however, have come up with a solution: rerelease the first Avatar in theaters. According to a trailer released on Tuesday, the 2009 movie is coming back to theaters for two weeks starting September 23rd and will be shown in “all formats,” including...

To kick off Gamescom this week, Geoff Keighley hosted his Opening Night Live event, a two hour-long gauntlet featuring announcements and trailers of video games, including many that aren’t made in the US. Here’s a not-at-all-exhaustive list of some of the most interesting games — if you want that, check out the full video here. We also covered some of the biggest news from the show in other articles, including Hideo Kojima’s new Spotify podcast, the release date of Return to Monkey Island, Sony’s new Edge controller, and even a Pokémon concept car.

The lawsuits are piling up for Pandora, which has been accused by comedians, including Lewis Black and Andrew Dice Clay, of streaming their works without the proper license. Now, George Lopez is joining the fray, seeking $5.5 million from the streamer.
Lopez filed suit on Tuesday, claiming that Pandora streamed two of his comedy albums, Right Now Right Now and Team Leader, without paying him royalties or obtaining the proper licenses from him. “[Pandora] decided it would infringe now to ensure it had this very valuable intellectual property on its platform to remain competitive, and deal with the consequences later,” the filing said. “Later is now.” A representative for Pandora’s parent company, SiriusXM, did not immediately respond to...

                              <span>@dalton_pierce and I began working on Tether while we were running our software development agency in NYC. As we scaled, we started to run into issues around our process for bug reporting and feedback across our team, clients, and users. Feedback was unclear, lacked the proper technical context, and was spread across multiple apps. 

This negatively affected our users, gave our clients a sub-par experience, and made our team less efficient. 

Up until now, we&#x27;ve been focused mostly on the internal use case. Teams doing QA, bug reporting, design QA etc. 

But today we are launching our free end-user widget! 🚀

With the widget you can:

-Enable end-users to report bugs &amp; feedback directly from your product
-Adjust the branding to make it feel like an extension of your product
-Control how and when the widget appears
-Sync your tools via our integrations (Jira, Slack, Zapier etc)
-Tether grabs technical details for you automatically

The widget is completely free to install and get started with. No time limit. 

We&#x27;re so excited to help you build better products, and make your users happier by making feedback easy.

                              <span>you-tldr, PicHance, scrilys, and launched all of them here on PH!

The idea of GitTrends came from the open-source work that we do in our daily jobs. We noticed how difficult it was to see when our repositories or developers were trending. For an event that can cause such an impact on open-source work, we thought there should be a dedicated solution. So we built it!

GitTrends allows you to search a database of GitHub Trending data that we collect every 5th minute. With a small fee, you can also subscribe for email alerts for a specific repository or Github username that you are interested in observing. Knowing that your watched repository or username is trending can significantly give you a burst of popularity on your repository or developer profile, which you can then take advantage of. For an open-source developer looking for work, or a small project that needs more eyes, getting on trending can be a game-changer.

As a note, we started collecting data in August 2022. We are looking for volunteers who would help us load historical data (i.e. from the BigQuery GitHub Dataset) to our database. Contact us for more details!

For the PH community only, we are launching with a 20% discount with Promo Code &quot;PH20&quot;. Get it now!

                              <span>What is WatchData?
It is a platform for blockchain developers and researchers that makes it easier to build and run blockchain applications and process blockchain data.

How does it help?
✅ WatchData eliminates a need to run your own node, allowing to call most of the JSON-RPC methods via our API the same way as it was your own node.
✅ Saves costs on development and associated expenses by scaling your infrastructure.
✅ Supports innovative blockchains (and we constantly add more!)
✅ Offers live blockchain data 24/7.

WatchData products include:

🚩 Problem: Teams and communities don&#x27;t interact enough on Twitter, leading to suboptimal reach &amp; growth for both orgs and their members.

🐪 Solution: Caravan makes it super easy for org members to engage with tweets from all other members, boosting everyone in the process.

How it works:
✅ Org members receive an engagement to-do list of recent tweets from other members.
🏅 This engagement is tracked on a leaderboard.
🤝 Follow everyone in your org with a single button click.

🐦 With our new browser extension, you can access your engagement to-do list in a sidebar while browsing the Twitter website!

Thanks so much to the Launch House community 🏠 , my advisors &amp; mentors, and everyone else who supported us along the way- we could not have done this without your amazing support.

Please feel free to reach out to me at any time with questions or comments!

Happy hunting :)

一位开发者发帖称，他想要修改汽车上的车载信息娱乐系统，他的汽车是现代公司 2021 款的“全新未来移动生活概念的电动汽车 IONIQ”。在试图找出如何为汽车更新定制固件时发现，其中用来为某些部分签名的 RSA 公钥可以在网上搜索找到。更离谱的是，正如这位开发者说的，“如果运气好的话，他们不仅留下了公钥，还留下了私钥”，它是一个常见的密钥对，出现在“使用 OpenSSL 进行 RSA 加密和解密的 C 语言示例”之类的在线教程中，在这些教程中列出了使用的示例公钥和私钥。现代公司对此没有置评。

老王点评：这可真是按照教程来的，连示例的密钥对都一起学习了。




AI 被用于通过监控视频中的行人步态识别和分类行人

据报道，马里兰大学的一个明星教授研究团队在资金的支持下，开发了一种城市监控软件，可以根据行人的独特步态特征来识别他们。然后，该算法将使用这些步态特征将行人分为“好斗”、“害羞”、“冲动”和其他性格。“这些能力将被用来预测每个行人的行为，对监视很有用”。他们在赞助方提供的视频上进行了测试，并提供了该软件的 C++ 代码库和原始数据集作为交付品。该团队还进行了“模拟大规模异质人群的有效计算模型”等类似研究。这一研究引发了对“关于机器学习研究中的严重道德问题”的关注。

老王点评：AI 究竟该用于什么地方，该如何用，这里面不仅仅是道德问题，还应该是法律问题。我只能说这么多了。




苹果公司的服务成为其收入的重要来源

迄今为止，苹果公司已将 18 亿台设备装入世界上一些最富裕的消费者的口袋和办公桌上。现在，它正在向其他公司出售这些客户的使用权，并说服那些拥有其设备的人注册自己的订阅服务。去年，苹果的服务带来了 680 亿美元的收入，占苹果总收入的 19%。在最近一个季度，服务收入的份额甚至高达 24%。据估计，最大的一块是来自其应用商店的费用，去年的费用可能达到 250 亿美元。其次是谷歌为 iOS 中的默认搜索引擎付出的费用，2020 年付出了 100 亿美元，据估计现在接近 200 亿美元。而其广告服务今年估计是 70 亿美元。剩下的是一系列订阅服务：iCloud 存储、苹果音乐和苹果护理保险等等。

                              <span>红帽在宣布将工作重心从 CentOS 切换到 CentOS Stream 后，CentOS 的定位发生了变化。按照 CentOS 官方的说法，它从原来的 RHEL 下游项目变成了一个 Linux 开发平台，社区开发者可以与红帽的开发人员一起为 RHEL 做贡献。如果单纯的从字面上的意思来看，很容易让人理解为 CentOS Stream 就是红帽的开发测试版本，既然是开发和测试的版本，所以不稳定就是必然的。

那么实际情况是什么？

把一个大家可以免费使用的发行版变成了不稳定的开发版本，红帽真的这么不厚道么？我一直想写点东西来以正视听，直到我看到了 Stef Walter（他是红帽雇员，高级总监，软件工程（全球）。负责 RHEL 和 Satellite 的大部分工作：服务、应用堆栈、安装、升级、镜像构建等等）的博文《CentOS Stream 是持续交付的》，我知道我不需要写任何东西了，只需将它翻译成中文就已足够。为了方便大家理解，在原文译文的基础上，我加了很多注释。

通过这篇译文，我们可以找到下面问题的答案：


红帽为什么要做这个转变？

红帽的开发模式发生了哪些变化？

Stream和RHEL的异同在哪里？

Stream稳定么？


持续交付 101：持续做苦难的事情，它们就会变得容易！

从外界看来，我们构建 RHEL（包括 CentOS Linux）的方式十多年来似乎没有什么变化。但在幕后，我们正在进行一场巨大的改革，即如何在不影响客户的情况下开发 RHEL。

我在很多的会议上讲述过这个故事，但有关 CentOS Linux 8 和 CentOS Stream 的公告推动了我在这里讲述这个故事。

三年前（原文发布于 2020 年，因此这里是 2017 年），我们几个在 RHEL 工程部工作的人有了一个想法：如果我们将现代化的开发实践…</span>

LaTeX 文件准备系统有一段有趣的历史。在 1968 年，程序员 Don Knuth 用一种老式印刷排版方式，撰写了他的第一本书《计算机程序设计艺术The Art of Computer Programming》。当他在 1976 年出版第二版时，出版商已经转向现代照相排版技术。

Knuth 对新版本的外观不满意。他从程序员的角度解决问题，决定创建他自己的文字处理系统，这样以后他出版的书就可以以相同格式排版，拥有相同的外观。因此，Don Knuth 在 1978 年编写了第一版 TeX 。

几年后，Leslie Lamport 创建了一组宏定义，以便作者更容易编写复杂文档。Lamport 的宏定义扩展，即 LaTeX，有效地扩展了 TeX 能够轻松创建各种文档。例如，许多学术组织使用 LaTeX 出版期刊和论文集。

NetworkManager was introduced in 2004 to make network configuration more flexible and dynamic. The old SystemV startup shell scripts, of which the interface configuration files were a part, were incapable of handling WiFi, wired, VPNs, broadband modems, and more—or at least incapable of doing it quickly or efficiently.
In a series of articles, I&#x27;ve written about why I&#x27;m a fan of NetworkManager and how I&#x27;ve used it. In part 1, I looked at what NetworkManager does and some of the tools it provides for viewing network connections and devices. In that article, I mentioned that NetworkManager does not need interface configuration files for most hosts. Howe…</span>

前言
最近有一个小需求：图表支持局部显示，如下底部的区域选择器支持
左右拖动调节中间区域
拖拽中间区域，可以进行移动
图表数据根据中间区域的占比进行显示部分数据

这样当图表的数据量过大，不宜全部展示时，可选择的局部展示就是个不错的解决方案。由于一般的图表库没有提供该功能，这里自己通过绘制来实现以下，操作效果如下所示：

1. 使用 chart_range_selector
目前这个范围选择器已经发布到 pub 上了，名字是 chart_range_selector。大家可以通过依赖进行添加
dependencies:
  chart_range_selector: ^1.0.0

这个库本身是作为独立 UI 组件存在的，在拖拽过程中改变区域范围时，会触发回调。使用者可以通过监听来获取当前区域的范围。这里的区域起止是以分率的形式给出的，也就是最左侧是 0 最右侧是 1 。如下的区域范围是 0.26 ~ 0.72 。

ChartRangeSelector(
  height: 30,
  initStart: 0.4,
  initEnd: 0.6,
  onChartRangeChange: _onChartRangeChange,
),

void _onChartRangeChange(double start, double end) {
  print(&quot;start:$start, end:$end&quot;);
}

封装的组件名为： ChartRangeSelector ，提供了如下的一些配置参数：

initStart
double
范围启始值 0~1


initEnd
double
范围终止值 0~1

前言
测算函数/方法执行耗时，对于每一位开发同学来说，似乎都是一道绕不过的坎，几乎都曾经历过。也许你会使用下面这种方式：

这种方法高效、成本低。但如果发散到测算成千上百个函数/方法执行耗时的时候，显然这并不是一个好办法。那么在iOS开发中有什么好方案吗？经过一番研究探索，我们实现了一套基于汇编hook objc_msgSend进行方法耗时计算的方案，开源地址见 -&gt;https://github.com/HuolalaTech/hll-wp-guldan-ios&lt;-。 接下来，带大家走进本文。
在开始之前，我们做以下约定：
本文中的 OC 指代 Objective C，ARM 指代 ARM 64。
背景
货拉拉移动端各条业务线产品，在每一次版本发布前，都会经过严格的各项性能测试，其中有一项启动性能测试，背后使用的是淘宝开源的tidevice工具（本质与libimobiledevice类似）。但这种性能测试处于流水线中末端，也有一定的分析成本。我们总结痛点如下：
定位难，责任划分不清；
方法耗时问题比较难以定位，不能定位到业务所在的位置，也就容易出现归属和责任不清的尴尬境遇；
动作滞后，影响发布；
启动性能测试处于流水线中末端，比较滞后，如果发现修复影响面比较大的问题，可能会影响版本发布；
工时长，不可持续；
Xcode Instruments虽然可以在开发时使用，但使用时间比较长，分析结果难以持续，近似属于消费完便丢掉的状态。
我们的目标是：
低成本：接入方低成本接入；
无侵入：不侵入业务；
高性能：性能足够高；
可视化：分析结果可视化；
探索
站在巨人的肩膀上
在梳理完需求之后，值得做的第一件事便是翻阅前人在该领域的探索和实践过程中所积累下来的资料。站在巨人…</span>

作为一个法学生，我的日常生活主要围绕在上课、论文、实习以及我杂七杂八的爱好上。今天在这里跟大家聊一聊我是如果进行任务管理的。
我的任务管理系统
软件的选择
从2017年接触滴答清单以来，滴答清单变得功能越来越丰富。熟悉这款软件的人都知道，如今的滴答清单已经不单单是一款Todo  List软件了，而是一款融合日历、笔记、清单、习惯打卡、番茄钟的“综合性”软件。
我相信大多数的“少数派”们都是“Less is more”的坚实簇拥者，看到现在的滴答清单一定也会和我一样不自觉的想起国产的印象笔记，觉得这是一款什么都做却又什么都做不好的软件。因此从2017年接触这款软件后，我很快又转向了Things、Omnifocus、Todoist、Anydo、2Do、微软Todo、Reminder……
不夸张的说，从2016年接触GTD概念后的我，基本用过市面上各式各样的GTD软件，但是时隔多年，2016年的我刚刚进入大学，如今的我研究生也已经快要毕业了，在经历过不同环境下各种工作流的转换，兜兜转转我还是回到了滴答清单，原因无他，唯性价比高、满足我的需求、稳定矣。
化繁为简
虽然现在的滴答清单功能复杂，但好在这款软件还是给我们“Less is more”的选择，即仅选择我们用得到的功能，隐藏那些我们用不到的功能

就我个人而言，我把滴答清单仅作为我的Todo List和日历，因此也就只选择了这两个功能模块。除了能够隐藏部分“功能”，在滴答清单里，还能够做到隐藏“视图”、“标签”等，将“Less is more”的观点贯彻到底，对于显示什么，不显示什么给了我们非常大的自主权。

下面我就来讲讲我具体是怎样使用滴答清单来处理我的日常生活的。

                              <span>越来越受欢迎的白板工具
最近几年市面上出现了很多白板工具应用，白板顾名思义就是在手机、平板、或者电脑上模拟现实生活中白板的应用。
白板应用从产品设计的角度来讲及其简单，因为白板应用的的概念模型足够简单——就是一张白纸、或者办公室放着的一块白板。
如果仅从概念模型上来看，白板应用似乎没啥可做的，你只需要写一个白板，然后做一个手写功能就可以了。
那么为什么市面上还是有那么多的白板应用呢？以及决定一款白板应用好不好用，我们是不是有什么样的评价标准呢？
对于这个问题，我想说的是，在保证使用体验的前提下，工具产品本身是没有好坏之分的，评判一款工具产品好不好其实没有意义，工具产品只能基于你的使用场景，评判适不适合。所以基于这个逻辑，我使用一个框架对市面上的白板应用进行了一个简单的分类。

 
在纵向，我根据使用场景来进行划分，就是你使用白板更多的时候是个人使用，还是需要和别人协作？
在横坐标上，我使用白板本身的功能性来进行划分，目前市面上的白板应用在功能性层面主要分为两类，第一类主打真实书写体验，无限书写区域，完全书写自由度，第二类则主打提供模块化的组件，弱化书写体验，强化沟通模版的白板应用。
从这种分类方式可以发现，其实个人的更偏向于自由度高的，而协作的更偏向于模块化的，为什么呢？
因为这和实际的工作场景是匹配的，个人使用白板，无论怎么发散书写，书写的信息的上下文都在个人脑中。但如果是协作场景的话，沟通的效率就变得至关重要，所以一些通用的，模块化的，标准化的沟通方法可以让所有对一个事情的认知都对齐，这种方法本质上是弱化了个人化的表达方式，用更标准的沟通方式来提升沟通效率。
也许以上分类方法并不是一定合理，但就目前我自己用起来是OK的。
在聊具体的白板应用之前我想，先聊一个问题。
为什么白板这么好用？

                              <span>上周三微信派发布了《2012.8.17，微信公众平台上线了》，引发了一群公号自媒体人的集体怀旧。是啊，已经十年了。
你或多或少还能想起一些公号大V，还有以前在朋友圈刷屏的文章，那些高光时刻像浮雕一样刻在脑海，好像见证着这个平台的兴衰浮沉。
今天不考古，也不讲宏大叙事，想从个人的视角，跟你分享下我与公众号的一些故事。

我第一次知道公众号是2013年，那是大一下学期，我也刚注册微信。
彼时微博正兴，因在校园杂志上看到「糗事大百科」博主赵诚玩微博年入千万，颠覆认知，第一次看到上学-工作之外的道路。
我能不能呢？不知道，但想试试。
寒假买了第一台笔记本电脑，从此没日没夜沉浸在微博里，研究怎么涨粉、互推、发段子。
做搞笑内容半年时间，小有成就，到了5万多粉丝（没买粉），偶有广告投放赚点零花钱，我对微博的发展充满信心。
注册微信后了解到公众号，那会儿我对它是不屑一顾的，长内容、排版难看、一天就发一条、没互动，怎么看都没出路。而微博不一样，信息流、用户停留时间长、话题多、互动丰富、140字段子&amp;新闻、搞笑动图，人们更喜欢，这才是媒介发展的下一个方向。
公众号就像上个时代的博客，现在无非迁移到移动端，换汤不换药。
谁愿意拿着手机看长文呢？
2014年，我给学校一家饰品玩具店出营销主意，老板问我要不要做公众号，我坚决说不要做，耽误精力、不能实时传达，还得引导关注，太麻烦，不如加微信好友送小礼品，然后朋友圈发优惠活动。人们不看公众号，但肯定刷朋友圈，触达率更高（没想到那会儿就有私域流量的理念了）。
转变是在大二下学期，微博起色不大，发送频率高又耽误学习，而且一直发搞笑段子觉得没意义，就把号卖了。
于此同时，公众号很多优质内容开始出现，好多大V也倾向长文、深度观点输出，即便是搞笑段子，质量也比微博高一个层次。自己开始沉迷每日阅读公号，朋友圈也经常有刷屏文章，同学讨论的也是XX文章的观点，仿佛突…</span>

                              <span>「第二份简历」
首先解释一下这个「第二份」是什么意思。我通常喜欢把在大四校招时使用的简历称作「第一份简历」，因为那是你踏入社会的第一步，是你第一次将自己的经历通过简历来展示。往后跳槽、换工作使用的简历都可以称作「第二份」，它代表着你已经是一个成熟的社会人，有足够的社会、工作经验。
那么就让我们先回看一下「第一份简历」我们都会写一些什么。我们在写校招简历的时候，通常会涉及到的内容为以下几点。

专业课分数 / 绩点
奖惩情况
兼职情况
在校期间参与的项目（可以是学校的实验，也可以是兼职参与的项目）
在校期间所任职务

这五点足够展现你在大学四年的能力，让校招企业充分了解你。因为能够参与校招的企业，都知道你不会有正式的工作经历，自然也没参与过社会上的工作项目。企业人事对参与校招的学生大多抱着「该生是否有培养空间」的态度来面对。因此在写校招简历的时候上面五点只需要充分体现你的潜力就足以吸引到大部分校招企业。
来到「第二份简历」，这个时候你面对的 HR ，不再会把你当作初出茅庐的应届毕业生，而是一个有着社会工作经验的求职者。HR 对求职者的要求也非常简单明了，即「你是否能为公司创造价值」。这个「价值」可以是短期内的，也可以是长远角度的，具体看 HR 怎么定位你的职位。但是有一点是不变的，那就是上面提到的，你不再是学生，你只是「求职者」。
如何写「第二份简历」
「第二份简历」相比「第一份简历」，会有不少内容上的变化。首先是不再着重于在校情况的描写，而是着墨于当前或者上段工作经历的一个梳理与细致归纳。不要简单概括，而是要将内容详细写出来。同时，在现公司或者前公司所做的项目，也要有个清晰的描写。
工作经历

                              <span>最近我们发布了一款全新的笔记产品——Neatfiy。（https://neatifyapp.com/）
正如其名，Neat（整洁）ify（化），Neatify 的初衷是编辑整洁清晰的结构化笔记，比起很快速的随手记备忘录，它适用于知识的管理、周期性的写作总结...之类的场景。
如左图
在大约去年年底的时候，我们立下了一个 Flag——我们要将专注笔记进行一次重构。 Neatify 就是我们拿出来的结果。下面不简单地聊一下，我们在这个路上的一些思考，以及集中回答一些朋友提出的疑问：

很多人对于 Neatify 的第一个疑问，就是为什么我们团队要出两款很相似的两款产品？

专注笔记，是我们第一款推出的笔记软件。也是我们团队首次接触「笔记」软件的开始，虽然我们自己也很喜欢专注笔记，它有很多很有用的功能及体验，比如结构化的目录、清晰的标注阅读体验。
但确实我们是第一次做笔记软件，前期很多没想清楚的地方，因此做了很多没什么用、甚至很负面的一些设计。这些是一些很沉重的历史包袱。如果我们还背着沉重的历史包袱，我们在优化的过程中就显得被束缚住了。
很显然的是，我们在这三年多的积累里，最重要的不是我们写过了什么代码，而是积累了很多很多的经验。所以我们这次，希望是抛开一切已有的东西，去构思一款自己心目中最理想的笔记产品应该是怎样的。这就是 Neatify。
在 Neatfiy 上面，我们并没有很刻意地去增加很多的功能，来让它看上去有很明显被“改版升级”的感觉，甚至做了很多的减法，比如：
1、把笔记本、子页面等层级都砍了，只保留文件夹 → 页面这样的结构，因为在使用专注笔记的时候，我们总在纠结，这样的层级关系，我们应该使用笔记本呢？还是子页面呢？还是文件夹呢？它们之间的作用太相似了，在每次使用的时候都要思考很久，这是意见很“反效率”的事情。
2、把很多花里胡哨的功能去了，比如各种各样的视图啊之类…</span>

在上篇文章 深入浅出 Retrofit 中，就是通过 动态代理 来实现具体的网络请求逻辑。本着刨根究底的原则，这篇文章来探究一下动态代理的技术原理。
静态代理
在这之前，先来看一下基础的 静态代理 。
接口类 ICount 和实现类 Counter ：
public interface ICount {
    void test1();
    void test2();
}
​
public class Counter implements ICount {
​
    @Override
    public void test1() {
        System.out.println(&quot;test1&quot;);
    }
​
    @Override
    public void test2() {
        System.out.println(&quot;test2&quot;);
    }
}

现在要加一个需求，统计 Counter 类中每个方法的耗时。本着开闭原则，对扩展开放，对修改关闭，最好不要去动 Counter 原本的逻辑，可以提供一个同样实现 ICount 的代理类 CounterProxy ：
public class CounterProxy implements ICount {
​
    private Counter counter;
​
    public CounterProxy(Counter counter) {
        this.counter &#x3D; counter;
    }
​
    @Override
    public void test1() {
        long start &#x3D; System.currentTime…</span>

本文一个定制样式的SwitchButton，使用Compose来写是非常容易的，下面先来看看我们对外提供如下方法：
@Composeable
fun IosSwitchButton(
    modifier: Modifier,
    checked: Boolean,
    width: Dp &#x3D; 50.dp,
    height: Dp &#x3D; 30.dp,
    // Thumb和Track的边缘间距
    gapBetweenThumbAndTrackEdge: Dp &#x3D; 2.dp,
    checkedTrackColor: Color &#x3D; Color(0xFF4D7DEE),
    uncheckedTrackColor: Color &#x3D; Color(0xFFC7C7C7),
    onCheckedChange: ((Boolean) -&gt; Unit)
)

我们先来实现点击切换，后面再来实现滑动切换，checked状态是需要外面(ViewModel)传过来，同样onCheckedChange回调的状态，需要同步更新到ViewModel中。
我们来简单的看看，只实现，点击切换按钮状态的效果代码：
// 定义按钮点击的状态记录
val switchONState &#x3D; remember { mutableStateOf(checked) }
// Thumb的半径大小
val thumbRadius &#x3D; height / 2 - gapBetweenThumbAndTrackEdge
// Thumb水平的位移
val thumbOffsetAnimX by animateFloatAsState(

通过本文可快速了解：
1.为何使用 MVI
2.为何最终考虑 SharedFlow 实现
3.repeatOnLifecycle + SharedFlow 实现 MVI 思路
为何使用 MVI
MVI 是一响应式模型，通过唯一入口入参，并从唯一出口接收结果和完成响应。
换言之，通过将 States 聚合于 MVI-Model，页面根据回传结果统一完成 UI 渲染，可确保
所获 States 总是最新且来源可靠唯一
可消除 mutable 样板代码
“消除样板代码” 相信开发者深有体会。“所获 States 总是最新且来源可靠唯一”，对此存疑，故我们继续一探究竟。
MVI 原始理论模型
根据网传 MVI 理论模型，经典 MVI 模型伪代码示例如下：
data class ViewStates(
  val progress: Int,
  val btnChecked: Boolean,
  val title: String,
  val list: List,
)
​
class Model : Jetpack-ViewModel() {
  private val _states &#x3D; MutableLiveData()
  val states &#x3D; _states.asLiveData()
  fun request(intent: Intent){
    when(intent){
      is Intent.XXX -&gt; {
        DataRepository.xxx.onCallback{
          val s &#x3D; _states.getValue()
          s.progress &#x3D; it.progress

登录拦截-Intent的实现
登录拦截-动态代理Hook的实现
登录拦截-拦截器模式的实现
前言
前面的一篇文章我们讲到了Intent原始的方法，虽然使用起来很麻烦但是还是能实现效果的，那有没有简便一点的封装？
有的，其实就和本篇的标题一样，早前网上还有这样的一种方案，使用动态代理+Hook的方式，替换启动Activity的对象，把全部的startActivity都拦截掉，替换掉我们自定义的Activiy。
如果都写死了所有的Activity跳转都写到一个拦截中，我们又如何实现拦截登录的功能呢？
我们整理一下思路：
我们需要先使用动态代理+Hook的方式替换全部的Activity启动。
我们在动态代理的回调中我们需要拿到原始的Intent，内部判断是否已经登录
如果已经登录，我们需要放行，直接执行原始的Intent方法。
如果没有登录，我们需要拦截，替换掉原始的Intentn，跳转到我们指定的Intent - LoginActivity的跳转。
那如何实现登录完成继续意图呢？还是和前面的文章一样，还是把之前的inent当参数传递给LoginActivity，然后让LoginActivity帮我们执行之前的Intent。
接下来我们一步一步来实现这个方案。
一、动态代理 + Hook 的实现
在之前的文章我们讲过插件化的实现有点类似，插件化一般是替换系统的 mInstrumentation 为自己的 Instrumentation 。
而我们这里没有这么麻烦，我们这里需要Hook的是ASM ，是A…</span>

                              <span>研究发现所有的网络拥塞控制算法都可能是非常不公平的

尽管在过去大约 40 年中提出了数百种控制计算机网络“拥堵”延迟的关键算法，但没有明显的赢家。一项新的研究发现，每种拥塞控制算法都无法解决“饿死”的问题，即让一些用户占据了所有的带宽，而至少有一个人基本上得不到带宽。拥塞控制算法依靠数据包的丢失和延迟作为细节来推断拥塞，并决定发送数据的速度。然而，数据包可能因为网络拥堵以外的原因而丢失和延迟 —— 这被称之为网络“抖动”。而拥塞控制算法无法区分由拥塞和抖动造成的延迟的区别，由抖动引起的延迟是不可预测的，最终会导致出现饥饿的情况。

老王点评：这就是算法的不公平，或许，限定在算法的层面上，并无一个完美的解决方案。




TikTok 否认内置浏览器记录用户输入

研究发现，流行 iOS 应用如 TikTok、Instagram、FB Messenger 和 Facebook 都支持用户在应用内打开浏览器访问第三方网站，期间会植入跟踪代码。以 TikTok 为例，它会记录用户的所有键盘输入，包括密码信用卡信息等敏感数据，以及屏幕上的每一次点击。从技术上说这相当于安装了一个键盘记录器。在这一报道发表之后，TikTok 发表声明，证实该功能存在，但 TikTok 并没有利用这些代码。TikTok 表示应用内浏览器旨在提供更好的用户体验，它植入第三方网站的 JS 代码是为了调试、排错和性能监视。

老王点评：植入这种第三方 SDK，即便是没启用，但是谁知道你什么时候会启用呢？




美国绝大部分雇主正在跟踪员工的生产力

根据《纽约时报》的调查，美国 10 个最大的私人雇主中，有 8 个正在为他们的雇员追踪生产力指标。其中一些软件测量活动时间，观察键盘停顿，甚至默默地计算击键次数。他们看到了从写电子邮件的时间到键盘活动的一切。如果员工没有达到预期的目标，就会产生影响：一个催促的通知，一个跳过的奖金，或者一个在家工作的日子被剥夺。对于在返回办公室的斗争中投降的雇主来说，这种监控是保持控制感的一种方式。

老王点评：这可真是“工具人”，我觉得这和用代码行数来统计程序员的绩效具有“异曲同工之妙”。</span>

                              <span>根据 Aiven 的一份新报告，谷歌已经提高了其对开源软件的投入，并在活跃贡献者方面超过了微软。


根据 Aiven 的报告（LCTT 译注：我没有找到这份报告），谷歌目前的活跃贡献者多于微软，这要归功于对开源代码库 GitHub 的每月提交量同比增长 20%。根据开源贡献者指数（OCSI）的数据，谷歌 7 月份有 5421 名活跃贡献者，而微软的活跃贡献者为 5268 名。

Aiven 联合创始人兼首席技术官 Heikki Nousiainen 说，谷歌超过微软“特别令人惊讶”。

“这其中的一个因素是微软对开源项目的提交逐年下降，”Nousiainen 说，“然而，微软对开发者自由和创新的投入是一致的，该公司是开源的主要参与者，甚至在 2018 年收购了 GitHub。”

Aiven 指出，亚马逊已经开始更加重视开源计划，其对 OpenSearch（ElasticSearch 的复刻）的支持以及 GitHub 上项目数量的增加就是证明。Nousiainen 认为，亚马逊对 OpenSearch 和 ElasticSearch 的支持代表了“该公司方向的重大改变”，以及对重大开源项目掌舵的愿望。据 Aiven 介绍，这些科技巨头正在迅速扩大对开源软件的使用。根据数据，现在来自亚马逊、微软和谷歌的活跃 GitHub 贡献者比六年前多了 300%。

“这项研究的总体信息是积极的，”Nousiainen 说，“在开源社区有大量的创新在继续发生，其结果使我们所有人受益。数不清的人正在为其他人树立一个榜样。”

                              <span>每年，我们都会讨论 Linux 桌面年。当我们看到操作系统在消费者领域的市场份额有所增加时，却知道是无望的。




当然，Linux 主导着整个云行业（Web 托管、云计算、数据仓库等）。在这里，我们只关注桌面 Linux 的市场份额。

如果你是 Linux 世界的新手，可能不知道，Linux 不是一个操作系统，它是一个内核。但是，为了简单起见，我们倾向于将 “Linux” 称为操作系统。你可以在我们的解释文章中了解 Linux 是什么。

有朝一日，我们希望 Linux 发行版在未来的桌面操作市场份额中占据主导地位。但是，当前的趋势说明了什么？现在是 Linux 桌面年了吗？

趋势每个月都在变化。去年，与今年相比，Linux 可能市场份额更多一些。因此，跟踪最新报告至关重要。

在这里，我们试图以来自不同来源的每月更新报告的形式跟踪最新趋势。

操作系统市场份额：2022 年 7 月


我们每个月都会更新可用信息。请注意，上个月的信息将在下个月发布。因此，例如，当我们在 8 月份更新报告时，它将包括 7 月份的统计数据。


在可用的桌面操作系统（Windows、macOS 和 Chrome OS）中，Linux 通常倾向于占据第三位。

The GNOME Console isn&#x27;t as feature-rich as a lot of other terminals, including the previous GNOME terminal, but I like it and have been using it regularly for the past few months. I enjoy the simplicity of it. I waste time in other terminal emulators configuring fonts, colors, and profiles.
Console does have some options and nice integration with the GNOME desktop. I&#x27;ll start with t…</span>

                              <span>前言
NestedScrolling是Android推出的一套嵌套滑动机制，能够让父View和子View在滑动时相互协调配合可以实现连贯的嵌套滑动，它基于原有的事件分发机制上为ViewGroup和View增加处理滑动的方法调用。本文从基本NestedScrolling机制的基本原理出发，详细介绍了如何利用NestScrolling机制实现LOFTER新版个人主页嵌套滑动效果。
1.效果预览
LOFTER 7.1.0版本需求，个人主页要实现以下嵌套滑动效果：

2.技术方案选型
需求上需要实现父布局优先滑动、滑动到某个时机子布局开始滑动，然后子布局滑动到一定距离能够吸顶，而且子布局需要支持完全滑出页面等交互效果，这种效果通常使用coordinatorlayout + appbarlayout + viewpager实现， 初步尝试发现不能完全满足视觉的效果需求，比如下拉滑走、下拉回弹这种效果不能简单实现，若要实现需要很多hook的配置方式，不好扩展及维护，最终选择利用嵌套滑动的基本原理实现了一套适合我们自己业务场景的嵌套滑动控件，能够适配更多的个性化滑动的场景需求。
3.嵌套滑动的基本原理
传统的嵌套滑动处理从事件分发的角度出发，有以下两种处理方法：
3.1 外部拦截法
外部通过调用onInterceptTouchEvent方法决定自己是否消费该事件
3.2  内部拦截法
内部通过父类的requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent告诉外部是否要拦截事件
在传统的触摸事件分发中，如果不手动调用分发事件或者去发出事件，外部View最先拿到触摸事件，一旦它被外部View拦截消费了，内部View无法接收到触摸事件，同理，内部View消费了触摸事件，外部View也没有机会响应触摸事件。
而接下介绍的NestedScrolling机制，在一次滑动事件中外部View…</span>

写作小白需要避免的五个写作误区和灵魂五问
一、前言
Hello，我是小木箱，今天主要分享的内容是: 5种搭建⽂章架构的⽅法!
大家普遍有一个共同的疑惑——如何写作? 其实是一个很难回答的问题。因为问题比较空泛，好比别人问你怎样赚钱一样难回答。
如果问我如何写好一篇文章?需要具备的核心的技能是什么？我可能会说: 搭建框架，框架是文章的根基，能不能搭好文章的框架决定了文章的质量。
想要写好一篇文章，最先要做的便是搭建文章框架。为什么这么说呢？因为如果写文章不搭建框架，那么写作会出现以下三种情况。
二、三种情况
2.1 第⼀种情况:写着写着思路断了
第一种情况: 写着写着思路断了 ，断了也不要紧，接不回来了才尴尬。刚刚明明想得很清楚，上了个厕所，就忘了接下来应该怎么写了。
2.2 第⼆种情况:写着写着就跑题了
第二种情况: 写着写着就跑题了，写得很嗨，写得很快。一顿操作猛如虎，行云流水 30000 字，写完一看，完了，跑题了，BBQ了。
2.3 第三种情况:逻辑处理不够严谨
第三种情况: 思路也没断，也没跑题，逻辑处理的不太严谨，大大影响了内容的质量。
三、搭建文章框架
这三种情况是因为没有搭建文章框架导致的。框架是写文章时的指路灯。这条指路灯是你的逻辑。它确保你的内容不会冲出跑道，第一读者读起来没有压力，第二写的时候会更容易，所以说搭建文章框架是写作最关键的一步，那怎么搭建文章框架呢？我总结了五种搭建文章框架的方法。
3.1 时间的顺序
第一种，按照时间的顺序布局，在自媒体写作中，第一种常见的逻辑顺序是: 按照时间的顺序来写时间自带的逻辑，从昨天到今天，从今天到明天，这是时间逻辑；年终总结，从年初到年中，从年中到年终，这是时…</span>

前言
关于App实现登录的拦截再执行逻辑，我已经出了几篇方案了，有些同学可能会问，你整的一些花里胡哨的有啥用，原生的Intent就能实现这些功能,我都是这么用的。
其实也没错，其实我之前也是这么使用Intent用的，应该算是比较基本的用法。下面一起看看基于Intent怎么实现登录拦截，又有哪些实现的方式？好不好用呢？
一、ResultApi
最基本的用法就是 startActivityForResult onActivityResult ，当然这一种方案已经Out了，谷歌也推荐我们使用Result Api，关于这一点后期会单独讲，这里还是以 onActivityResult 为例子。
     //Intent的方式
        mBtnProfile2.click {

            if (!LoginManager.isLogin()) {
                gotoLoginPage()
            } else {
                gotoNextPage()
            }

        }

USB “橡皮鸭子”看起来就像一个普通的 U 盘。但把它插入电脑，机器就会把它看作是一个 USB 键盘。最初的 USB “橡皮鸭子”在 10 多年前发布，成为黑客们的最爱，如创建一个假的 Windows 弹出框来获取用户的登录凭证，或使 Chrome 浏览器将所有保存的密码发送到攻击者的服务器。这些年来它也在不断更新。新的 DuckyScript 3.0 允许用户编写函数、存储变量和使用逻辑流控制，成为了一种功能丰富的语言。它还可以将数据编码为二进制格式，并通过键盘的大写锁定或数字锁定灯的闪烁作为信号，来窃取目标机器的数据。用这种方法，攻击者可以把它插上几秒钟，告诉别人：&quot;对不起，我想那个 U 盘坏了&quot;，然后把它拿回来，并保存他们所有的密码。

Copilot 将使计算机教育的编程练习变得毫无意义

有计算机教授担心 Copilot 将使传统的计算机教育的编程练习变得毫无意义，因为 Copilot 知道所有的答案。“据我所知，Copilot 在所有的入门编程作业上都接受过专门培训，Copilot 该死的喜欢编程入门作业。”虽然很多计算机编程练习可以在网上找到代码的例子，但老师也可以在谷歌上找到它们，然后用抄袭检测器将这些代码与提交的代码进行比较。而 Copilot 是不同的，它实际上产生了新颖的解决方案，在表面上有足够的不同，以至于它们看起来可能来自学生们自己写的。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：确实，这就如同使用计算器来学习初等数学，并不能真的让人学会数学。所以，计算机教育需要为 Copilot 这类 AI 工具的到来做一些准备。除了限制对 Copilot 的访问，是否还可以做更多的事情？




新的后量子密码学算法将于 2024 成为标准

上个月，由恩智浦、IBM 和 Arm 的安全专家共同编写的专门安全算法被美国 NIST 选中，成为旨在应对量子威胁的行业全球标准的一部分。NIST 宣布了这些后量子密码学算法将在 2024 年成为标准。而目前通行的 RSA 和 ECC 等密码学算法用了十多年才确定了最佳标准。

老王点评：先不说两年时间能不能准备好，我认为现在的抗量子加密学算法还未经受过考验，仓促之下怕是用处有限。</span>

                              <span>上一讲“猛药”过去，功效性的讲解就要小小告一段落了。在护肤金字塔的第二层，只剩下了“修护”这个话题，而在金字塔的顶端，“再生”我们还有没有提到。修护与再生，代表了皮肤自身的规律，修护受损的细胞，代谢老去的废物，同时刺激新的牺牲生成。修护和再生在一门交叉学科，很难把他们分开。那么就从这里开始，让我们看看修护和再生的秘诀。
什么是修护与再生
我们的皮肤，每天都冲在第一线，帮助我们抵御外界的侵袭，所以皮肤每天都在“受伤”，修护，就是要让我们的皮肤屏障更坚挺，保证皮肤能够处于正常的工作状态。
但修护并不等同于“包扎伤口”，不是只有当皮肤已经明显受损以后才需要修护，而更像是增强免疫力，需要从日常下手，维护皮肤的健康状态。所以，修护既是我们大妈们锻炼身体的广场舞，也是医生关键时刻可以救命的手术刀。
而再生，依赖于修护，又高于修护。修护的目的就是让皮肤获得健康稳定的状态，从而促使其再生，再生依赖于修护提供好的基础，同时又在修护的基础上提供和创造新生。
修护与再生的场景
不同的情况下，我们所选择的修护方法、成分、产品也不尽相同。
日常修护
大多数时候，我们需要的都只是日常的修护，目的是让白天工作了一天的皮肤得到舒缓和放松，类似于我们每晚的睡眠，是为了让皮肤可以继续保持一个健康稳定的状态。这种情况下，并不需要使用什么猛药，只需要选择皮肤容易吸收的，温和的产品，就可以达到我们的要求。这时修护的关键词是：温和。
晒后紧急修护
紫外线对皮肤的伤害，在防晒的一讲中已经充分解读（忘记了，可以回看这里），但有时候我们难免遇到极端天气，或者一时犯懒，防晒做的不好，导致皮肤被晒伤。这时皮肤往往处于一个非常脆弱的状态，继续急速有效的镇定，来帮助皮肤迅速回到相对稳定的状态。这时修护的关键词是：极速。
过敏修护
对于敏感肌同学，经常需要面对的就是解决自己的过敏问题，当皮肤受到一些并不耐受的刺激，就会激发皮肤的自我…</span>

进度条是个好东西，在日常的工作生活中，总会有一些场景是它能大展身手的。
做项目管理时，我们能通过一个里程碑的进度条，了解其下多个任务的整体进度；做预算管理时，设置好每个类别的预算上限，进度条就能告诉我们各个类别下的预算使用情况；测评打分时，进度条也能直观展示各评分项之下，打分对象的得分情况（比如餐厅的口味、环境、服务），方便我们对比绝对值、相对值。
如果你是一名 Notion 的资深用户，可能已经早早的在 Notion 数据库中用上了进度条，但你可能不知道，Notion 最近的一项更新，让进度条对 Notion 新手变得更低门槛、触手可及了。
在这篇 Notion 进度条教程中，我将围绕此次更新的进度条功能，介绍这 4 点内容：

Notion 新推出的进度条功能
相比原有方案，新的进度条好在哪
哪些地方可以使用新进度条
如何设置进度条

希望通过这篇文章，能帮助你更好的使用 Notion、释放自己的生产力。
原生支持的新进度条
大约 4 天前，Notion 官方发布了一条推文，宣布为进度条增加了原生支持。

从原推文的动图中可见，在 Notion 的数据库中，可以根据给定的属性值生成进度条图形，并紧邻数字显示，目前有条形（Bar）、环形（Ring）这两种可选样式：
Notion 官推里，用动图演示了进度条的设置操作
我也在自己的数据库中尝试了这两种样式，数字阅读起来确实会更直观一些。
条形进度条环形进度条
如果看到这里，你已经迫不及待想用起来了，可以通过目录直接跳至最后一章了解如何设置，如果你还想了解新进度条的便捷性、适用范围…</span>

理性聊车，高尔夫也很好，特斯拉也很棒，奔驰宝马大家都喜欢，在此分享一下购车的一些想法和感受，祝大家都拥有自己的爱车。
我自认从工作以来和车的缘分还是非常深的，从 4S 销售到广告策划，又因为接触大众、斯柯达更多，再到家里换了奥迪后，与其说是喜欢，不如说是对这种德系品牌的习惯。结合到家里本身有车，我的车就不需要承担「家庭重任」，可以随我喜欢。但提车后的这一个多月，这台小车让我开始强烈的感受到「家的责任」。
提车日
购车在上海上半年疫情解封之后，去到奥迪4S店，看到店里积压了较多库存，当时我自己也没有特别倾向的颜色，A3的颜色除了红色我都挺喜欢，就在库存的冰川白、探戈红、环焦蓝、纳瓦拉蓝中，选择了较深的纳瓦拉蓝，张扬的造型配一个低调内敛的颜色。中配（时尚运动）的车型上，库存车上额外增加了四门无钥匙进入（+¥2000），加上购置税减半政策，实际落地20万不到。

奢侈与吝啬的交织
20万买 A0 小车，奢侈
最开始的选车首先当然是预算，20万以内，另外优先紧凑级，SUV 或 Sedan 我并不是特别在意，但两厢车型是我比较青睐的。第八代高尔夫和 A3 Sportsback 是最后的二选一，同样的预算高尔夫可以买到顶配 R-Line 版本，拥有更多的科技配置。而 A3 在20万内，只能说配置相对实用一些，没有氛围灯、副驾驶电动座椅等等这些。
网上说的最多的，就是 A3 不过是换壳高尔夫，还要加钱。说对也对，但在做工和实际的细微体验上，还是会有所差异。其实最后更促成下单的，是展厅销售的态度，毕业那年我自己也做过汽车销售，了解一些展厅里的道道。你如果问我，是不是有虚荣心的成本，那我的答案是肯定的。

不加2万上顶配，吝啬
从升级配置来看，时尚运动与豪华运动之间，相差近2万，增加了：

30色内饰氛围灯
电动折叠后视镜，带副驾驶侧下翻
副驾驶电动座椅与多向调节
三温区空调
主驾驶1…</span>

背景
自高中起，就有将自己的错题整理到云端的想法，可以随时随地通过手机查看，便于复习。但是限制于当时的环境，不能方便使用数字工具，此想法便不了了之。不过「笔记数字化」的念头自此萌芽。
上了大学以后，接触到了 OneNote。将有价值的「文章」、上课的笔记、PPT「搬运」到OneNote 上，像一只勤劳的小仓鼠，不断囤积「知识」。看着软件日渐增长的「占用大小」，充满了成就感。但是工作之后，慢慢发现积累的这些「知识」无法应用到生产实践当中，很多笔记可能自「搬运」进 OneNote 之后便再也没有打开过。
偶然的一次机会，听到了 flomo 创始人少楠老师关于「知识管理」的讲座 ，其中提到我再熟悉不过的一句话：

搬运是一种浪费。

作为一位工业工程专业的毕业生，「搬运浪费」作为「八大浪费」之一是学习的重点，也是工作的切入点。但是我之前只将其应用于工作的生产过程，却忽略了自己的「知识加工」过程。我突然意识到，在我原本的知识管理流程中，「搬运」占据了很大一部分，而忽略了这是极大的浪费。这种搬运不产生任何附加值，也不会加深知识在自己大脑中的印象，也就不可能在以后需要的时候轻易调用。除了浪费时间和精力，顺便满足了自己内心小小的成就感和虚荣心之外，几乎没有益处。因为从生产的角度讲，「搬运」的知识只是从工厂门口搬运到了加工车间，堆放在角落里，几乎不可能搬上生产设备，更不可能成为有价值的「产品」。
在少楠老师的推荐下，我开始接触 《卡片笔记写作法》 一书，尝试使用双链笔记工具重新打造我的「知识加工厂」。

九月将至，大一新生踏入校园的同时，大四「老油条」们也开始准备自己的毕业论文与实习工作。学年论文与毕业论文时本科生绕不过的一座大山，以下是我在大四撰写论文时积累的一些个人经验与见解，希望对学弟、学妹们的论文写作有所帮助。
电子资源
文科专业的大部分学生在本科阶段，了解学界研究会借助知网、万方数据等文献数据库。国内高校图书馆也会购买文献数据库的使用权限，方便校内教职工与学生使用。在校园网中打开图书馆的网站，找到电子资源栏目，便可以看到学校已购买的电子数据库。除了学校提供的电子资源，不少地方图书馆对当地公众与读者提供电子资源，如国家图书馆、浙江图书馆在注册后便可免费使用。

扩展阅读：《免费看论文？除了学校的图书馆，还有 ……》

当我们搜索某个领域的文献，数据库会返回不少的文章，文章的质量良莠不齐，参考文献的作用时帮助你了解研究话题的学术现状、存在问题、解决方法等，导师进行论文指导也会强调尽量挑选时间较新的「核心期刊」与「原始文献」，注重文献的权威性、专业性与时效性。在数据库搜索时，我们可以通过筛选功能，选择来自「核心期刊」的文献，如北大核心、南大核心、SCI、EI、SSCI 等期刊目录。
期刊筛选
大部分阅读与参考的文献我是从万方数据下载的，PDF 文档方便在不同的软件中阅读与文献管理，二是万方提供的 PDF 文档默认自带目录与文字图层，知网（大陆版）默认只提供 CAJ 格式的文档，缺德到家。
Word 主题样式
不少大学生在「制造学术垃圾」使用的主流写作工具是 Microsoft Word，最头疼的除了正文写作，还有学术论文的格式规范。一篇学术论文的结构大致可分为以下四大部分：封面、目录、正文以及引用。
论文结构
以我大学的《毕业论文档案打印和格式要求》为例，除去页面设置、撰写规范、字词符号用法等要求，大部分内容的格式涉及到 Word 中的字…</span>

前言
对于Flutter开发者来说，build_runner 可以说并不是一个陌生的东西，很多package中就要求调用build_runner 来自动生成处理代码，比如说json_serializable;
但正如其描述中所述的那样，其是通过 Dart Build System来实现的，build_runner 和其又是一个什么关系，接下来就来学习一下dart的build系统
dart 的 build 系统
组成
dart 的 build系统，由 build_config、 build_modules、build_resolvers、 build_runner、 build_test、 build_web_compilers 共同组合、完成了dart 的 build 系统；
build_config 就是解析那个build.yaml文件，用来配置build_runner，没什么好说的，具体的功能后面再细说；
build_modules 好像是解析module级别信息的一个库
build_resolvers 从自述文件中分析，好像是一个给build_runner 每步提供所需信息的解析器？
build_runner 整个build系统的核心部分，其他部分都是为了拓展和实现此功能而存在的；
build_test 字面意思，一个测试库；
build_web_compilers 用于web端的build系统；
作用
Flutter的build系统其实就是生成代码，对标的应该是JAVA的APT这块的东西；
另外，对于 dart 的 build 系统，官方是有这么一段介绍：

Recently, I published my first book, The Kubernetes Operator Framework Book from Packt Publishing. Writing a book has always been a personal goal of mine, and so it seems fitting that I was able to check that off by writing about one of my favorite topics: Kubernetes.
My journey with Kubernetes began in 2016, as a software engineer for Red Hat OpenShift. There, I had the opportunity to work with (and learn from) some of the smartest folks in the open source community. I learned first-hand some of the best practices for Kubernetes development as they were applied to broad enterprise use cases. And as I watched the development of OpenShift 4 take shape, I got to witness the functionalit…</span>

Notes are part of any writer&#x27;s life. Most of my articles begin in a note-taking application and that’s usually Joplin for me. There are a large number of note-taking apps for Linux and you may use something other than my favorite. A recent blog article reminded me of a half dozen of them, so I assembled a list of my favorites.
Joplin

Joplin is available on Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. I like Joplin because it automatically saves whatever you add to it.

审核和内容收集
(虽然是具体情况具体分析，但是对于部分节目可以固定下来)
 
1、资料完善度
主持人需要详细的提纲，这对后面流程完善起到重要作用
主持人需要提交的是:嘉宾资料(姓名正确书写、头衔、照片、希望给到的社交媒体账号)+**建议标题**+采访内容&amp;提纲+音频收集+建议删除内容
 
2、素材给到时间(1.5 小时，2 人对话)
负责人:主播+监制
素材一般提前7天，至少不晚于3/4日给到
 
3 播客完成版提交审核的时间
负责人:后期
后期的制作的重点永远是:时间节点，如果只给到2天时间制作，请用好这两天时间，没必要永远优化细化无止境的美化下去。
理想的完成版审核日期，是上线前1日以上，如果无法在1日之前提交，请提前在群中说明原因
 
此外:剪辑之前请提前和节目负责人(主播/监制)确认:是否需要给嘉宾审核，考虑到嘉宾时差(如北美时间)、工作繁忙(大公司CEO)，可能需要跨自然日审核，所以最好上线前至少两天给到嘉宾粗剪版用来审核.
 
比如周二上线商业Y酱，周一需要提交音频审核，如果周一无法提交审核，需要周五说明情况

                              <span>由于上学和工作的关系，最近十多年我一直住在机场附近。机场内会有比其他地方更加专业的气象观测设备，而且能做到实时更新。借助这个优势我养成了看气象报文、雷达拼图和Prog Charts来判断天气的习惯。当然了，我做着一份靠天吃饭的工作，肯定是比别人更关心天气。那今天跟大家聊一聊我在平时是怎么看天气的~
一般情况
系统自带的天气app永远是最方便易用的，开机即用功能简单。在把天气信息截图分享，一目了然。我就偶尔问Siri或者Google Assistant明天天气怎么样，享受一下有助手的高级感。
看本场天气
我一般住在机场附近，所以看机场的气象报文基本等于在看自己家的天气。METAR1报看实时天气，TAF2报看未来24小时。可以看到刮什么样的风，下什么样的雨，能见度适不适合出门拍照，几点到几点不能上天台晒被子，有+TSRA了去远程哄一哄被打雷吓到的妹子，等等这些。

在 Android 平台上使用的是 Avia Weather ，简洁而且免费，只看天气很够用。付费之后可以解锁Groups功能，可以把一些机场分类。
 
在iOS上用的是AeroWeather Pro，最主要的是它有好用的Widget，还可以添加到Shortcuts。订阅后可以解锁所有飞行中能见到的气象图表。
 
报文里乱七八糟的字母和数字看不懂没关系，有兴趣的童鞋推荐给你们两份指南，一份是FAA的，一份是USAF的 。
看未来天气
    
MyRadar和Windy的功能类似，可以选择查看的信息极其丰富，好多航校甚至是航空公司也会用他们的数据。想要看懂这些图？不如来这里学习一下：aviationweather.gov/help 。下面是看图经验：

被高气压控制，通常都是好天气，反之亦然
有黄色或者西红柿炒鸡蛋颜色的地方一定有雷雨
预判雷雨的移动方向和速度
准静止锋类似暖锋，有持续不断的阴雨连绵
孤立的雷暴单体，下雨也就是一阵儿
冬天爬山，可以在零度等温线附近打卡留念
等压线密集的地方，有大风！
预测你的航班会不会因为天气原因延误
朋友坐飞机，告诉ta在起飞后的多久会遇到明显颠簸
看到哪里有火山喷发，搜一下那里附近的人上传的视频

除此之外，还能在Flightradar24上查看到气象信息，搭配飞机的飞行轨迹，看雷雨绕飞更加直观。不过实时的飞行轨迹和滞后的气象雷达图之间会有错位，有时候感觉莫名其妙。雷雨天气去机场接朋友，可以精准地选择出发时间，能在家多待会儿就多待会儿。
  
 
如果订阅了ForeFlight，再去坐飞机，会让飞行体验有质的飞跃~
 
我想大多数人都不会为了简单看个天气去搞这么复杂，不仅要记住奇奇怪怪的符号还要在app之间换来换去。只是因为我的工作离不开这些，顺便就带到了生活中，用起来还很顺手，就一直这样了。
我印象中分钟级降水预报是前几年彩云天气最早做出来的，我也有一个同样分钟级预报的故事：有一天我恰好在AOC大厅的气象雷达屏幕前，我想能不能人肉播报一次天气预报啊，于是就给我远在老家的老妈打了电话。问她家里是不是阴天啦，有没有下雨啊，她说阴天了没下雨。我说过一会儿就下啦。电话里聊了大概十分钟之后，诶，雨就来了。
哦对了，如果你女朋友说，晚上吃完饭我们去海边散散步吹吹海风吧。你一定要纠正她，晚上在海边儿吹的是陆风，不是海风，要不然叫海陆风也行。总之，天气这件事儿一定要弄清楚。</span>

 作为一个抖音受害者，我时常反思，有没有办法像刷抖音一样地学习？
 于是我拿出了 RSS 这个远古信息管理神器。 
上一篇文章，我们解决了「RSS 订阅源」的问题，本期内容我们就来解决 RSS 的第二大难题：RSS 阅读器。
一、RSS 阅读器
RSS 阅读器的选择，可以说五花八门。 
但总体上可以分为两种：一种是本地阅读器，一种是在线阅读器。
1、本地 RSS 阅读器
浏览器早期自带就有 RSS 阅读功能。 
但自从 2018 年 Firefox 也宣布取消 RSS 功能后，RSS 就彻底与浏览器分家。 
如今想要用 RSS，那么就要用浏览器扩展，又或者是客户端软件，现在常用的本地 RSS 阅读器有： 

本地 RSS 阅读器的特点，是操作感强，自定义功能多。 
但同时，本地 RSS 阅读器需要用自身网络来抓取更新，所以如果你不开启的话，那么就不会有新内容。
2、在线 RSS 阅读器
而在线 RSS 阅读器的特点，则是支持自动更新，还有跨平台同步。 
而且，一般还会有全文搜索、内容过滤、第三方服务集成等高级功能，现在常用的在线 RSS 阅读器有： 

但在线 RSS 阅读器的缺点也很明显。
 首先，免费帐户往往都会有订阅源数量、刷新时间的限制，并且还会有广告。 
所以综合而言，RSS 阅读器更好的选择是：使用本地 RSS 客户端来浏览在线 RSS 帐户。
3、Windows / 安卓方案
在 Windows 平台，我的选择是 Fluent Reader + Inoreader 内地版。 
Fluent Reader 是一款开源免费的 RSS 阅读器，界面简洁好看，而且是目前唯一全平台支持的 RSS 阅读器。 

Inoreader 的内地版（地址里比原来多一个 n），
是目前大陆地区，为数不多还能用的在线 RSS 阅读器。 …</span>

                              <span>写在前面
2020 年 7 月 29 日，我来到了北京，开始了自己的北漂生活。工作之后发现时间过得很快，转眼已经北漂两年了。在北京短短的两年里，留下了很多珍贵的回忆。北漂一年整的时候就有写篇回忆录的想法，但迟迟没有动笔，如今已经开启了北漂的第三年，感觉是时候开始提笔写这篇回忆录了。
前段时间在中国好邻居家里吃了顿饭，听阮哥说起「到底什么是北漂」。我觉得每个人对「北漂」的定义都是不一样的。我理解的「北漂」，暂时先卖个关子。
在北京
当初自己本科毕业的时候首选的是在北京、上海、深圳三座城市找工作。大学因为没在一线城市读，时常懊悔和一线城市比，资源还是匮乏，所以工作说什么也要去一线城市感受一下。后来因为上海离家太近首先就排除了上海，加上一直没去过北方，就直接考虑了去北京工作。
当初考虑北京的因素其实有两个，一是北京的互联网氛围我了解到的是比上海、深圳要好的，比如很多互联网公司当时都是在北京成立的，二是我很喜欢音乐，作为全国摇滚的发源地，氛围这方面北京是当之无愧的全国第一。
其实在北京最大的一个感受就是舒服。曾经听网上有人用一个字来形容北京，那就是「土」。在北京生活了两年，倒也确实慢慢理解了北京的「土」。比如胡同的起名，比如北京人的打扮没有那么精致，比如 CBD 旁边可能就是普通居民楼。
胡同
很喜欢北京的一点就是有逛不完的胡同。虽然随着城市规划，胡同已经少了很多，但我两年里仍然没有把每一条胡同都走一遍。而且北京的胡同绕到完全能让人迷路，从这条胡同穿到那条胡同的感觉太奇妙了。
前段时间参加了朋友拍的《胡同日记·春》纪录片线下放映活动，衔接去年冬天拍的《胡同日记·冬》。在她的镜头下，我感受到了北京胡同里发生的美好。如果有机会，还是挺想搬去胡同住一段时间的。
最喜欢的就是鼓楼那一片的胡同，咖啡店和小清吧很多。不管是白天在胡同里找家咖啡店坐下来喝一杯，还是晚上和朋友吃完饭，穿梭在胡同里，…</span>

众所周知，Square 出品的内存泄漏检测工具 LeakCanary 可以很方便的检测出 App 中存在的内存泄漏问题。当我们决定要不要在项目中引入 LeakCanary 的时候，经常也会听到声音：
“LeakCanary 接入简单，无需手动初始化。”
“LeakCanary 虽好，但就是太卡。”
“LeakCanary 虽好，但无法线上使用。”
一度我也是这么认为的，直到我认真研究了下才发现，事实可能并没有那么简单。本文就是尝试从 LeakCanary 的一些高级用法，来重新论证上述的观点。 文末会附上完整代码，可直接使用。
想要使用 LeakCanary 的一些高级用法，首先就是需要我们主动掌握 LeakCanary 的初始化时机，添加一些自定义的配置，下面就看一下如何手动初始化 LeakCanary ？
如何手动初始化 LeakCanary ？
正常情况下，我们只要添加下面一行代码，就可以在 App 中使用 LeakCanary 了。
dependencies {
  // debugImplementation because LeakCanary should only run in debug builds.
  debugImplementation &#x27;com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:2.9.1&#x27;
}

自动初始化
这是怎么做到的？是采用了 ContentProvider 的加载机制来做的。简单讲大致流程如下：

先执行 Application中的attachBaseContext 函数；
然后会执行 ContentProvider 中的 onCreate 函数；
最后才会走到 Application 中的 onCreate 函数中；

                              <span>一、背景
现在的移动应用，视频是一个非常重要的组成部分，好像里面不搞一点视频就不是一个正常的移动App。在视频开发方面，可以分为视频录制和视频播放，视频录制的场景可能还比较少，这方面可以使用Google开源的 grafika。相比于视频录制，视频播放可以选择的方案就要多许多，比如Google的 ExoPlayer，B站的 ijkplayer，以及官方的MediaPlayer。
不过，我们今天要讲的是视频的缓存。最近，由于我们在开发视频方面没有考虑视频的缓存问题，造成了流量的浪费，然后遭到用户的投诉。在视频播放中，一般有两种两种策略：先下载再播放和边播放边缓存。
通常，为了提高用户的体验，我们会选择边播放边缓存的策略，不过市面上大多数的播放器都是只支持视频播放，在视频缓存这块基本上没啥好的方案，比如我们的App使用的是一个自己封装的库，类似于PlayerBase。PlayerBase是一种将解码器和播放视图组件化处理的解决方案框架，也即是一个对ExoPlayer、ijkplayer的包装库。
二、PlayerBase
PlayerBase是一种将解码器和播放视图组件化处理的解决方案框架。您需要什么解码器实现框架定义的抽象引入即可，对于视图，无论是播放器内的控制视图还是业务视图，均可以做到组件化处理。并且，它支持视频跨页面无缝衔接的效果，也是我们选择它的一个原因。
PlayerBase的使用也比较简单，使用的时候需要单独的添加解码器，具体使用哪种解码器，可以根据项目的需要自由的进行配置。
只使用MediaPlayer：
dependencies {
  //该依赖仅包含MediaPlayer解码
  implementation &#x27;com.kk.taurus.playerbase:playerbase:3.4.2&#x27;
}

使用ExoPlayer + MediaPlayer

0x1、引言
解完BUG，又有时间摸鱼学点东西了，最近在复习Kotlin，跟着朱涛的 《Kotlin 编程第一课》查缺补漏。

看到泛型这一章时，想起之前面一家小公司时的面试题：
说下你对泛型协变和逆变的理解？
读者可以试试在不查资料的情况下能否答得上来？
反正我当时是没想起来，尽管写过一篇《Kotlin刨根问底(三)：你真的懂泛型，会用吗？》，我以为自己对泛型了然于胸。
究其根源，对概念名词的理解浮于表面，模棱两可，知道有这个东西，但本质是什么？为啥要用？怎么用？并没有二次加工形成自己的思考和理解，所以印象不深刻。加之 泛型平时开发用的不多，记和忆 两个要素都没做到，久了自然会忘。

而网上关于泛型讲解的文章大都千篇一律：集合 存取元素类型异常引出泛型，不变、协变、逆变、型变一把梭，什么能读不能写，能写不能读，读者看完好像懂了，又好像没懂，这很正常，毕竟作者自己都可能弄不明白，2333。就问你一句：泛型只能用在集合上吗？

综上原因，有了这篇文章，本节换个角度，从根上理解泛型，少说废话掐要点，这次一定拿下Java/Kotlin泛型。
0x2、泛型到底是什么？
直接说结论：
泛型的本质 → 类型参数化 → 要操作的数据类型 可以通过 参数的形式来指定。
说人话：把数据类型变成参数。
难理解？类比 函数/方法，定义时指定 参数类型(形参)，调用时传入 具体参数实例(实参)：

泛型 也是如此，定义时指定 数据类型(形参)，调用时传入 具体数据类型(实参)：

非常相似，只是 数据类型 的定义和传递都是通过 ，而不是()，那 泛型的作用是什么呢？直接说结论：
语法糖 → Java制定了一套规则 (书…</span>

前言
上一篇提到：Android—以面试角度剖析HashMap源码，分析了HashMap源码。为了加深印象，因此这篇将会实现手写HashMap！
话不多说，直接开始！（结合上一篇一起看效果更佳哟）
1、初始化
从上一篇我们知道：HashMap初始化分为：无参构造器；有两个参数的构造器。因此我们照虎画猫也来搞两个构造器！
1.1 无参初始化
从上一篇我们得知：
初始化无参构造器，对应map长度默认为：1 implements Map {
    //     扩冲
    float loadFactor &#x3D; 0.75f;
    //16  1 implements Map {
    //     扩冲
    float…</span>

前沿
关于对角棋相信大家都不陌生，其凭借着规则简单又灵活多变成为我们童年不可缺少的益智游戏。
今天我将用Flutter来实现一个对角棋游戏，即巩固自己Flutter的绘制和手势知识，也希望这篇文章对大家有所帮助。
演示效果
老规矩，我们先演示下实现的最终效果：

对角棋规则
首先我们还是回顾下对角棋游戏的规则，这里借用 百度百科 的规则说明：
棋盘：象棋棋盘中，将士所在的带对角线的田字框。
棋子：双方各持三子，颜色不同。
初始：如图1所示，各自对立。
胜利条件：其中一方三子，占据一条对角线，或者对方没有棋子可以移动。
玩法：沿着棋盘划线，双方交互移动棋子，一次一只能移动一步，不包括交叉。


实现思路
棋盘。绘制棋盘
棋子。绘制棋子
手势。处理点击棋子及移动位置手势
规则。规则分为棋子移动规则、游戏胜利规则两部分

具体实现
1. 绘制棋盘
说到绘制，我们需要先创建 CustomPaint 通过自定义 CustomPainter 来实现。
CustomPaint(
    size: Size(width, height),
    painter: DiagonalChessPainter(),
)

考虑到我们要适配不同的手机尺寸，因此我们先通过 LayoutBuilder 测量整个 Widget 的尺寸，并计算棋盘在屏幕上位置。
LayoutBuilder(
        builder: (BuildContext context, BoxConstraints constraints) {
          initPosition(constraints);
          return GestureDetector(…</span>

At this year&#x27;s DrupalCon North America, EPAM Solution Architect John Picozzi presented a talk about the importance of non-code contribution. He talked about how everyone can get involved and why he believes this is an important topic. This article is a text adaptation of John&#x27;s talk; find a link below to a video recording of the complete presentation at DrupalCon.
What is non-code contribution? I asked Google this question and got the following answer: &quot;Any contribution that helps an open source project that does not involve writing code.&quot; Thanks, Google, but I already figured that out. If you asked me to dig deeper, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about providing your time, skills…</span>

写在前面
现在的我已经不再是一个学生，甚至也不再做研究。不过，写毕业论文的时候采用的工具和方法，确实一直沿用至今，已经为工作而进行了些许改良。在读硕士研究生的三年生活中（其实第三年已经在工作岗位上度过），我曾经尝试过不少与研究或者论文写作相关的数字工具；这些工具中有些帮助我在阅读文献的过程中准确把握文章意思，从而确定了个人选题；有些则在实验进展过程中帮助我看清数据之间的关系；还有些则是论文写作的时候帮了我大忙… 不过，这三年的研究生历程也让我越来越意识到，工具与效率之间并非强烈相关：或许有的时候工具的使用反而让人南辕北辙，采用更加精简的工具，以及加入更多个人的思考，才是完成研究工作的重点。
这篇文章仅仅是想要介绍自己在论文写作的过程中用到的一些工具与方法。我研究的科目是汉语作为第二语言习得。研究生期间除了研究本身，还需要承担一些教学工作，以及一些学生管理的工作，这篇文章也会有所涉猎。
Notion：是知识库，也是数据库，还是静态网页
Notion 的多面性与灵活性，我想少数派上的众多文章已经解释得清楚明白。但至于具体如何使用，这就看个人的情况了。在我个人的例子中，主要使用了 Notion 以下几个方面的特性：

数据库功能 - 用于学生信息管理、进度追踪、组会笔记
反向链接功能 - 用于阅读文献和笔记重点内容
静态网页分享功能 - 用于呈现课程大纲、更新课程材料

Notion 的数据库功能，由于数据库中每一条都可以单独作为一个页面，每一个页面上又可以创建新的数据库…… 如此嵌套之后，形成了十分灵活的数据库体系。无论是用于学生信息的管理、进度追踪还是系列笔记，都可以在短时间内搭建起较为整洁美观的数据表格。
Notion X 学生管理
研究生期间一大工作是助教工作，需要管理一个二三十人的留学生班级。在学期初，我从教务老师那里拿到学生名单之…</span>

                              <span>痛点
之前我跟你聊过很多次用卡片笔记法写文章的事儿。今天咱们换个话题，聊聊用卡片法做视频。
现在是移动互联网时代，学习和工作中需要用到视频制作的地方，还真不少。尤其是像我这样当老师的。

我这几年做了许多视频。但是实话实说，凡是复杂一些的视频，特别是技术类讲解展示，我在制作的时候总会感觉很焦虑。
焦虑的原因，是表达欲和成熟度不匹配。
我最想表达的时刻，往往是刚让电脑跑出来一个结果。这时候，我特别想把自己的成果和喜悦心情分享出去。
但是，一般这时候内容成熟度是不够的。例如前面的铺垫内容，还都没有准备好。讲解的思路，也都没有理顺。
怎么办呢？
常见做法，自然就是去查找和准备这些资料，直到胸有成竹。这样自己讲解内容时，才不会露怯。
可等到内容成熟度足够了，时间往往已经过去许久，我也没有那么想展示自己做出来的结果了，因为兴奋感衰退了。
很多有趣的内容，因此淹没在了我的笔记里。更可惜的，是那些没有记录下来的内容，就丢弃在风中了。可惜。
最近，我开始尝试用 Stable Diffusion 来人工智能绘图。这款工具真是非常强大。绘制出来的内容，比起 Disco Diffusion ，要精细得多。说明一下，我不是画家，上面描述的，是本人尝试对比后的主观感受。请不要跟我讨论某些风格上「Disco Diffusion 甩开 Stable Diffusion 几条街」之类的。不听不听。
举个例子，我最近开始读《九宫格写作法》这本书。里面有一段描述顾客尝试过一碗汤后的评论：

汤底是炖了 3 天的猪骨浓汤，配菜是汆烫得恰到好处的豆芽菜，吃起来脆嫩爽口。桌子上放有店家推荐的柚子胡椒，只需撒上一点点，柚子那清新的酸味便会让你眼前一亮。

我于是好奇心大起，就想尝试一下，这碗汤画出来是什么样子。于是我决定用 Stable Diffusion 来画。
首先还得把上面那段话翻译成英文，因为 Stable …</span>

这个APP是弄毕业设计的时候写的，也是一个比较成规模的个人项目，断断续续花了几个月的时间，将会分为多篇文章记录一下。刚开始写这个APP的时候也仅仅看完郭霖老师的一本《第一行代码》。由于在学习的过程中用到了很多别人的成果，纠结了很久发不发出来，现在发出来用来记录我的Android学习路程。后续将会用多篇文章爬坑。。。
先上项目链接
https://github.com/MReP1/LittleGooseOffice
项目中的代码有部分来源于开源代码，由于写的时间离现在有点远，有些记不清，如有冒犯到，请联系本人。
日历模块来自于：https://github.com/huanghaibin-dev/CalendarView 3.7.1开源版本，由于用的时候JCenter跑路了，因此就拷了一份放本地。
时间选择模块来自于呆呆维尼大佬的：https://juejin.cn/post/6844903685441454087 很好用，推荐！
富文本模块忘了。
APP封面也忘了，如有抄袭到原作者的设计，请联系我。
设计

在进行APP UI设计的时候参考了Material Design的设计和使用了Error配色。[设计稿链接]
(https://www.figma.com/file/V7rofx7MnlAsZUVcmmOZ1i/Account?node-id&#x3D;712%3A1773)

由于当代Android手机太大了，因此我主要将操作区域放在了屏幕的中下方，将展示区域放在屏幕的上方，方便使用。
APP中的主要功能为笔记、记账、记录事务、纪念日的功能，有很多市面上应用的影子，也比较缝合。
MVVM
本APP架构使用了MVVM架构。
Model 层
在数据持久上使用了Room数据库，使用DataStore存放一些不是很重要的数据，没有架设服务器。在使用Room的时候遇到了比较多的坑，并且网上常见的教程都是关于简单使用，场景一旦复杂就没什么教程了，之后有时间会写一期说说。

ViewModel 层
ViewModel使用了Jetpack同名框架ViewModel，这里就没什么好说的，主要承接View和Model层之间的中间人。

View 层
View层主要应用到了观察者模式，也是第一次接触这个模式。

部分界面展示
主页

账单分析界面
设计比较多的数据处理，使用MPAndroidChart开源库生成图表。

纪念日界面
主要功能仿造Day Matter倒数日

多选删除
说实话这个功能看着简单，做起来不简单。。。在实现的时候用了很多笨方法，性能其实不是很好，胜在测试数量不大（几千条）的时候也不会造成不流畅的现象，在以后掌握了新知识的时候会对这一块进行重构。

总结
暂时先到这啦，先占个坑。以后慢慢对项目中的比较重要的地方爬坑。</span>

对于应用开发工程师来说，虽然我们不需要写操作系统代码，但是了解View最终是如何显示到屏幕上还是非常有必要的
本篇是Android图形系列的第三篇文章，在之前的两篇文章中分别介绍了屏幕的“显示原理”和屏幕的“刷新原理”，今天我们来一起学习Android系统的图形架构设计，聊一聊输送到屏幕的画面数据是如何产生的
本文的目标是希望读者朋友建立一个Android图形子系统的框架，因此，文中不会包含太多的方法调用链以及代码逻辑，非Android开发工程师也可以放心食用
前排提醒：全文近2万字，建议阅读时长30分钟

一、开篇
“当我们点开‘微信’这个应用后，它是怎么在屏幕上显示出来的？”
这是一个非常复杂的问题，它的背后包含了由厂商驱动、Linux操作系统、HAL硬件抽象层和Android Framework框架层共同组建的一套非常庞大的Android图形子系统
想要给出这个问题的答案，就必须对Android图形子系统背后的运行流程有所了解
今天，我们从认识Android设备中的硬件开始，自下而上
一起来看看庞大的Android图形子系统是如何组建起来的
1、硬件驱动
雷总曾经说过，再复杂的系统设计，也离不开硬件的支持
在文章的开头，我们就先来了解一下：支撑应用程序绘图的硬件有哪些？

随后，谷歌承诺包括三星、小米、iQOO、摩托、一加、OPPO、Realme、vivo、传音、华硕、夏普、诺基亚、索尼等在内的第三方厂商，也会在今年晚些时候带来升级更新。对Android比较关注的同学可能知道，Android 13带来了安全改进、UI/主题完善、生产力提升、OpenJDK 11 LTS更新、ART优化、垃圾收集改进以及其他各种进化和变化。

需要注意的是，Google Pixel 6/Pixel6 Pro和Pixel 6a由于其搭载自研Tensor处理器，正式版Android 13会连同Bootloader一块更新，带来的结果就是，后续不能降级回Android 12。不过，正参与Android Beta项目也就是使用Android 13测试版的Pixel 6不影响，主要退出Beta，就能回归Android 12。

根据之前官方的介绍，最新的的Android 13主要升级点包括隐私安全和大幅优化大屏、折叠屏、小内存手机的流畅度。

When it comes to time synchronization for embedded systems in a distributed architecture, there are &quot;soft&quot; use cases (typical, everyday devices) and complex, or &quot;hard,&quot; use cases (car brake systems, aerospace). It&#x27;s easy to see that a hard use case has unique requirements and a low tolerance for latency. To put it another way, hard use cases have hard, real-time constraints.
Latency is the bitter enemy of real-time computation. Latency, in the context of a critical real-time application, is the time between data generation and data reception. The reality is that when there is an interconnected network of several systems, there&#x27;s latency.

早在今年 2 月，CalDigit 就正式在全球发布了新一代雷电 4 的扩展坞 TS4。作为 TS3 Plus 的升级版本，更多的接口和更高的规格，着实让我有了不少期待。和 CalDigit 的朋友联系之后，我也在 3 月中旬收到了这款真正让我「梦寐以求」的雷电 4 扩展坞。
但关于它和它背后的故事，还要从 2019 年说起。
缘起于 2019 年的一个期待
在 2019 年的年度征文中，我曾经描述过一个符合我需求的理想型扩展坞是怎样的。然而，由于 macOS 系统和雷电 3 的一些限制，我始终没有找到这样一款设备。在前前后后摸索的过程中，总计花掉了近一台 iPhone 11 的钱。
首先，由于 macOS 并不支持通过 DisplayPort 来实现 Display Chain，想要以扩展形式连接显示器就必须占用掉下行的雷电接口，否则就只能镜像显示。其次，雷电 3 在带宽的分配中，硬性规定了必须保留 18Gbps 的带宽用于显示信号（DisplayPort）的传输，实际留给数据传输的空间只有 22Gbps。而且，显示带宽在不足时，还可以占用这为数不多的 22Gbps 数据带宽，反之，就算没有外接显示器，数据带宽也不能使用为显示预留的 18Gpbs。
当时妥协但最好的选择：CalDigit TS3 Plus
直到雷电 4 的到来，这个情况才得以获得改变。
首先，Intel 在雷电 4 协议上取消了为 DisplayPort 预留 18 Gpbs 带宽，提供了满速的 32Gbps 数据传输（相当于 PCIe 3.0×4），尽管还…</span>

软件的选择与流程的建立
在漫长的学习之路上，我遇到了学习软件，它们和我磨合、指导我的学习、被我不断的筛选。在这个过程中我逐渐有了一些想法来选择软件，并最终建立流程。
软件的主要特性-一切的基础
我也许从来都是一个缺少方法的人，直到软件进入我的生活，与其说它们是工具，不如说它们是我的一部分关于学习的性格。 我从不对软件硬性要求，要求它符合我的工作流程或是符合我的方法论，我对它们抱有了更大的期望，我对那些能做我以前做不到的事的软件抱有期望，因为它们的价值是难以衡量的。 于是我要求它有某种特性，可以与我使用的软件区别出来，完成我曾经难以完成的工作。
方法论-以实际的场景体现
软件的诞生一开始就会被打上开发者的烙印，就像是同样的教科书，不同的主编会有不同的侧重一样。如果一个软件有着鲜明的主要功能特色那它几乎一定体现着某种思想，但是方法论存在着问题，就是难以证伪，越是想用思想捏合成一座大厦最后会发现地基可能都是不牢的。那么如何使用方法论呢？
1. 与科学接轨，学习有关知识；对信息源可信度进行筛选
2. 在使用中验证方法论，最好有一定程度的量化
3. 简化抽象方法论，细化具体方法论不至于在臃肿中走向模糊
4. 重视全面和逻辑性 
扯远了，在软件的方法论验证中，重要的无疑是第二条。 如何验证呢，就是在它主张的场景使用它（或仅仅是想象使用），注意它的价值，这是我认为最好的方式，一个好的软件应该是向你描绘了一个出色高效的使用过程。 另一种方法是看受人欢迎的软件，某种意义上来说它的有效经过了人的验证，注意它的独特性即可。
软件的使用与功能的解构
当我们使用一款软件，很多情况下并不是按照作者给出的使用场景进行使用，但这不意味着这种使用是错误的，因为开发者不可能列出所有的使用场景，也与你的面对的场景不尽相同。了解软件的边界重点在于对其功能的理解。
1、具体的使用场景下蕴…</span>

We started working on Colonist in 2018 because we wanted to play Catan with our family. None of the online versions were really playable, so, like any programmer would have done, we built our own! Since then, we have worked tirelessly to create the best gameplay experience possible. Over time, we have grown and improved our player experience, and at this point, it is clear that Colonist is ready to become a staple in online strategy gaming.

This is why we are proud to officially announce Ranked Mode and a Leaderboard system for Colonist! Competing in Ranked is easy:

1. Navigate to https://colonist.io/ and select either “Ranked 4P” or “Ranked 1v1” 
2. Play in 10 placement games to establish your Matchmaking Ranking (MMR)
3. After your placement games, you will be placed in matches against players with similar MMR. Fight to move your way up the leaderboard!

In the future, we plan to have prizes for top finishers and create a ladder-like league with divisions. In the meantime, we crave feedback and would love to hear about all of your experiences playing on our site. Please let us know what you think in the comments.

May your roads be long and your armies large,
Goktug Yilmaz
