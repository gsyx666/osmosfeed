                              <span>Twitch has caused confusion among its users by restricting browser support to just Chrome, Edge and Firefox. | Nick Barclay / The Verge
    

  
Poor communications from Twitch have led to confusion following the service announcing that Chrome, Edge, and Firefox are currently the only web browsers officially supported by the popular streaming platform. No context was provided within the announcement, though it appears the restrictions are temporary and have been placed on alternative browsers so that Twitch can locate and shut down access points being used to create masses of bot accounts.
The issues started when users started experiencing errors when logging into the service. Twitch Support then addressed the situation by asking users to login from an up-to-date version of the three supported web browsers, and announced that a help article to address troubleshooting the issues...

Microsoft is making its new version of Outlook for Windows available to all Office testers this week. The new Outlook for Windows app will make the desktop email client a lot more like the web version. Microsoft has been working on this redesign for months, and originally released a semi-public beta earlier this year. 
“Since then, we’ve received valuable feedback from Office Insiders on Beta Channel about how to create a more consistent, feature-rich experience,” explains Margie Clinton, group product manager on the Outlook team. “We’ve been listening to feedback since May and our team has been working diligently to improve the new Outlook for Windows.”

4K and 120fps support is listed, alongside support for ultrawide 21:9 aspect ratio monitors, Nvidia’s DLSS, and Variable Refresh Rate (VRR). These are the best improvements to Sackboy: A Big Adventure yet, following a resolution and visuals boost on the PS5 version.

Starting September 2022, all new cars sold in the US are required to come standard with AEB, which uses forward-facing cameras and other sensors to automatically apply the brakes when a crash is imminent. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimates that AEB may help prevent 28,000 crashes and 12,000 injuries by 2025.
Using four common vehicles, AAA wanted to put AEB to the test to see how it’s progressed since first rolling out to production vehicles nearly 20 years ago. What they found was not that...

This Friday’s Yankees game against the Orioles will no longer be exclusively available on Amazon Prime Video, like 20 games before it: the game will also be airing on the Yankee Entertainment and Sports (YES) network, according to a tweet from the cable network. It’s a big change, and it’s something that Apple didn’t do last week, despite pleas from New York’s Attorney General.
Many Yankees fans will likely want to tune in to the game, as outfielder Aaron Judge could beat a record for home runs that’s stood for over 60 years (he matched it on Wednesday after this article was originally published). But the ability to watch the Yankees on YES has been a bit contentious lately; last Friday, New York’s attorney general Letitia James called...

In high school, I’d keep my CD player from getting crushed in my bookbag by wrapping it in a wool sock. Considering that the CD player was probably the most expensive thing I owned at the time, I probably could’ve done better. This is how I felt with the first case I bought for my Steam Deck. It was definitely a step up from mismatched footwear, but I knew a device like this demands a little more respect without keeping it constantly locked away inside the case that it was packaged with.


Dbrand, maker of accessories for your phone, AirPods, and even your PS5, shares this sentiment and made “Project Killswitch.” Killswitch is designed to be a better protective skin for the Steam Deck and started development shortly following Valve’s...

Do backups regularly
Let me tell you a story. In one of my previous jobs, I was the person responsible for making manual backups for WordPress websites. I did it every month, but one month I forgot! Guess what happened... Yeah, our website server was attacked, I didn’t think it would be significant as I made backups regularly. I thought I could just upload the last version I had, but after checking the folder on the NAS server and looking for copies, I nearly had a mini heart attack! It transpired that that month, there were a lot of changes t…</span>

                              <span>Glassmorphism is a new design trend that started in 2021 after many developers complained about the controversial style of another design trend, neomorphism. Today, many websites and UI implement the glassmorphism effect, including major tech giants like Apple and Microsoft. 
As the name implies, glassmorphism is about creating an HTML semantic container that resembles translucent glass. While the developer may decide the other style properties of the container, glassmorphism itself is the glass-like effect morphed with other developer-selected CSS properties.
Although some web applications generate the glassmorphism effect, and all you have to do is copy and paste the code in your code editor, it is a big challenge for a developer to know how to create one with CSS without external assist…</span>

                              <span>Bicep, the open source project used by Visual Studio Code to extend its capabilities, has finally arrived in Visual Studio, enabling users of Microsoft’s flagship IDE to use some of Bicep’s most popular features in the same program they have been using since they were introduced to it — in other words, Visual Studio itself.
The Bicep extension for Visual Studio Code was released 2 years ago (December 11, 2020) and as of today has over 450,000 downloads. I think it was about time it was available for Visual Studio, right?

However, not all of Bicep’s features are available in this release, so you might need to be patient while they make their way over there. Here’s what you need to know about Bicep and the extension that has brought it to Visual Studio.

There is certainly room for improving the code, the docs and the tests, there always is, but it&#x27;s good enough for me! Now I will take a small break and soon focus on the next step(s). After all, this was just a small stepping stone of a grander project.
I also wondered about the next steps:
Participate in Hacktoberfest? 
Showing this lib to specialized communities?
Writing a Dev.to article about something?

It Serves your code locally during development.
Bundles your JavaScript, CSS and other assets together for production.

There are many other tools out there that do the same thing. For example, we have WebPack, but what makes Vite different?
Well Vite was created by Evan Yu who also created Vue.js as a way to both simplify and speed up the build process.
Not long ago web developers had no native way to combine JavaScript files in a modular way this led to tools like WebPack and Rollup that concatenate multiple files together into a single bundle for the browser.

Hello, Let me tell you that I just restarted my work computer, why is this relevant? because I lost all my settings and it&#x27;s time to configure them again. I imagine you got an idea with the title, we will see the initial git configurations, the ones I need to start working.
I hope this publication is useful to you, I am sure it will be useful for my future self.
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. there is more software for version control, but git is the one I like to use.
First of all, to start a new repository we can use the command
git init

Now let&#x27;s set the user information (us).
git config --global user.email &quot;your@email.com&quot;
git config --global user.name &quot;your_name&quot;

To find where the settings are stored we can use the command.
git config --list --show-origin

Git works with branches, I&#x27;m sure you already know that, as I write this, the default name of the main branch is &#x27;master&#x27;. By convention we could call it &#x27;main&#x27;, let&#x27;s see how to change the name
git branch -m old_name new_name

to ensure that all projects start with the main branch name &#x27;main&#x27;
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

For bonus we are going to connect our project to a repository in GITHUB. As a first step we are going to set the &#x27;origin&#x27;
git remote add origin repository_URL

To verify that the URL was saved correctly
git remote -v

To fetch the latest version from the remote repository
git pull origin main

if there is an error for different versions we can add the flag &#x27;---allow-unrelated-histories&#x27;
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

Finally, to send our information to the remote repository we can do git push and save the changes from our local repository to GitHub
git push origin main</span>

                              <span>Now that we have medusa up and running, I wanted to move away from the default SQLite database as those are very limited.
The alternative would be Postgres, which medusa can efficiently work with.
Luckily, it&#x27;s relatively easy to set up medusa in docker.
Let&#x27;s see how that works.
Once you installed the medusa server project you&#x27;ll see that you have a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml file.
With those, we can spool up a running docker version of the medusa server.
Run the following command:
docker-compose up --build

Once it&#x27;s done, you should see the container with the part.

This already would have run the migration, but you can always open up the specific server docker terminal and execute commands.
Sometimes you might want to connect to the database to see what&#x27;s happening there.
To connect, use the following details:
host: 127.0.0.1

user: postgres

password: postgres

database: medusa-docker

port: 5432



And once in you should see all the tables!

And that&#x27;s it. Your actual server will be running on localhost:9000 as you would expect, and you can do everything as before.

                              <span>In my current project, we were designing a system with multiple APIs. The APIs we are building will be used by other systems as well. Whenever there is an API call we need to secure that API from external users so that we know only authenticated users are making use of our APIs and that is nothing but API authentication.
In simple terms, API authentication is all about proving or verifying the identity of the people accessing your system.

Its goal is to prevent attacks from cybercriminals who snoop around websites looking for the slightest vulnerability to take advantage of.

Our requirement was quiet simple that we need to secure our APIs in a way that other systems can easily use it. But at the same time we don&#x27;t want to share our username and password with other systems. Also in future…</span>

The fact is that Javascript is the language of the web. 
Every website that we browse from Google search or other search engines, uses JavaScript.
JavaScript facilitates every person, business, and organization’s interactive online presence across the world.
JavaScript is the world&#x27;s most popular programming language.
Brendan Eich created the JavaScript programming language and co-founded the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.
JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web (WWW), alongside HTML and CSS.
As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript for building webpages you can visually see (client side), often using third-party libraries.
Hence, one popular usage of JavaScript is to …</span>

Tokens:- Tokens are the smallest unit of programming language which helps the the programmer to create instructions
Tokens are two types
Keyword:- 
compiler aware words are called keyword


Keyword have predefine meaning and cannot be altered by programmer&#x27;s 


All Keywords are written low case.



Identifier:- Identifier are the names given by the programmer to the members of java such as class name, method name, variable name, interfaces name, packages etc.
There are certain rule to follow while naming the identifiers
Rules to name Identifier
1Programm ❌
Program1 ✅ 
2- Character spaces are not allowed while naming the identifiers
My First Program ❌
MyFirstProgram ✅
3- Special character are not allowed while naming the Identifiers other than &#x27;$&#x27; and &#x27;_&#x27;
$Programs ✅
_Program  ✅
4- Keyword cannot be used in Place of Identifiers</span>

复古计算的一个 “问题” 是，我们用紧凑型闪存、SD 卡甚至 SSD 来取代这些传统的机械硬盘时，通常情况下不会发出任何你能听到的声音。这样不但显得不够“复古”，而且有时你无法判断电脑是崩溃了还是仍在工作。有位极客制造的一个小装置解决了这个问题，它被称为 HDD Clicker，它连接到硬盘活动指示灯，触发扬声器发出的一系列咔嚓声，听起来非常像硬盘在寻找轨道。

老王点评：我觉得我的 SSD 硬盘也需要这样一个小装置，要是能像个 U 盘一样插上就能用就更好了。这就是“无用”的极客精神。




黑爵士达斯·维德的声音未来将用 AI 合成

为星战系列的黑爵士达斯·维德的配音长达 45 年的 James Jones 已经 91 岁了。他早就考虑退出了，在创作星战电视剧《欧比旺·克诺比》期间，James Jones 签署了允许迪士尼在未来项目中使用 AI 合成其声音的协议。他们使用的软件是 AI 语音建模工具 Respeecher，它使用了深度学习去建模和复制人类声音，能达到以假乱真。在此之前卢卡斯公司使用该软件在《曼达洛人》中克隆了天行者卢克的扮演者的声音。

                              <span>Rust for Linux 这个项目是希望今后可以使用 Rust 编程语言来编写内核代码，该项目已经进行了几年，有越来越多的开发者认为是时候将这项工作合并到主线中了。在 2022 年的 Linux 内核维护者峰会上，Miguel Ojeda 向大家更新了此项目的最新状况，希望能达成一致来确定何时可以完成合并。

他得到的答案是很清晰的：内核中确实很快会有 Rust 了。

这方面并没有什么悬念。Linus Torvalds 在会议开始时就说，他计划接受（可能在 12 月中旬发布的） 6.1 内核的 Rust 补丁，除非他听到强烈的反对意见。Ojeda 表示，他很期待这一天，并询问这些补丁应该如何进入主线。Torvalds 说，他不愿意直接接受这些补丁，所以看起来很可能需要 Kees Cook 来将这项工作引向上游。

Dave Airlie 说，有一些 MacBook 驱动程序的开发者打算用 Rust 来做他们的工作，所以很可能在不久之后就会有真正的 Rust 驱动程序进入上游了。不过，Torvalds 说他希望最开始只合入尽量少的内容，只是让基础设施先进入内核，让开发者开始使用它。它应该可以完成编译，但应该基本仅限在 “hello, world” 这种水平就好。他说，这将是一个向世界发出的信号：“终于落地了”。

Greg Kroah-Hartman 问道，针对特定子系统的 Rust 绑定实现，该如何进入上游；是应该通过 Rust 树还是通过相关子系统的维护者？Ojeda 回答说，Rust 核心支持应该通过 Rust 树来合入，但其他的应该经过维护者来合入。Alexei Starovoitov 担心，如果子系统维护者不想在他们的子系统中使用 Rust，他们也无法拒绝 Rust 补丁；James Bottomley 补充说，对于长期从事 C 语言开发的人来说，Ru…</span>

DDEV 是一个开源工具，可以在几分钟内轻松启动和运行本地 PHP 开发环境。由于其每个项目的环境配置可以扩展、版本控制和共享，所以它很强大和灵活。简而言之，DDEV 旨在允许开发团队在其工作流程中使用容器，而无需复杂的定制配置。

DDEV 用灵活、现代、基于容器的解决方案取代了更传统的 AMP 栈解决方案（WAMP、MAMP、XAMPP 等）。因为它使用容器，DDEV 允许每个项目使用任何一组应用、Web 服务器版本、数据库服务器、搜索索引服务器和其他类型的软件。

2022 年 3 月，DDEV 团队 宣布支持 Colima，这是 macOS 和 Linux 上的开源 Docker Desktop 替代品。Colima 是开源的，据所有报告显示，它比其替代方案有所 性能提升，所以使用 Colima 似乎是一个没有问题的选择。

迁移到 Colima

首先，Colima 几乎是 Docker Desktop 的替代品。我说几乎是因为在将它用于现有的 DDEV 项目时需要重新配置。具体来说，必须重新导入数据库。解决方法是先导出数据库，然后启动 Colima，然后再导入。很简单。

Colima 要求安装 Docker 或 Podman 命令。在 Linux 上，它还需要 Lima。

Docker 默认随 Docker Desktop for macOS 一起安装，但它也可以作为独立命令使用。如果你想要 100% 纯 Colima，你可以卸载 Docker Desktop for macOS，并独立安装和配置 Docker 客户端。完整的安装说明可以在 DDEV 文档站点上找到。

                              <span>Constellation 是第一个始终加密的 kubernetes（K8S）。在这个 K8S 中，你的所有工作负载和控制平面都被完全屏蔽起来，你可以使用加密证书远程确认这一点。


Constellation Kubernetes 引擎使用 秘密计算secret computing 和 机密虚拟机confidential VM，将 Kubernetes 集群与云架构的其余部分隔离开来。因此，无论是在静态还是在内存中，数据总是被加密的，并创建了一个 机密上下文confidential context。根据创建 Constellation 的公司 Edgeless Systems 的说法，由于它为在公共云上运行的数据和工作流增加了安全性和保密性，因此机密计算是云计算的未来。

Kubernetes 节点在使用 Constellation 的私有虚拟机中运行。根据 Edgeless Systems 的说法，机密虚拟机是安全飞地的演变，它将机密计算的三个原则——运行时加密、隔离和远程证明——扩展到整个虚拟系统。机密虚拟机（TDX）使用底层硬件对私有计算的特殊支持，例如 AMD 安全加密虚拟化（AEM）、SEV-安全嵌套分页（SEV-SNP）和英特尔信任域扩展。此外，ARM 去年还发布了名为 Realms 的新 V9 架构。此设计包括私有 VM 功能。

Constellation 尝试在集群级别提供证明或通过加密证书进行验证，以及“始终在线”加密。 Constellation 中的机密 VMS 使用了 Fedora CoreOS，它构建在一个不可变的文件系统之上，是面向容器而设计的。Constellation 还利用 Sigstore 来保护 DevOps 信任链。

使用秘密计算时，性能可能会令人担忧。是的，加密会影响性能，但 AMD 和微软的联合基准测试发现，这只会导致 2% 到 8% 之间的微小性能损失。Edgeless Systems 声称 Constellation 将在繁重的工作负载下表现类似。

鉴于 Constellation 已通过 CNCF 认证，并且可与包括 GCP 和 Azure 在内的所有主要云服务互操作，这应保证其与其他 Kubernetes 工作负载和工具的互操作性。

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

首先，非常开心少数派上婉莹和甜食大大的播客制作栏目《100 小时后请叫我播客主理人》终于上线了，两位都是我很尊敬的播客制作者，之前也和两位有过关于播客和其他领域（比如音乐收藏和泉州故事）的交流，相信这个栏目一定会给到各位对于播客有兴趣的朋友很多帮助。
关于如何制作播客的相关教程，互联网上已经不少了，我自己之前也和生产力维基的白宦成合作过一期简单教学版本《小白和大耳的播客入门指南》，私下里我也在深圳线下做过几次关于制作播客的心得分享。很多教程和指南往往会集中在技术，设备，内容策划和运营等等方面，是一种「法」或者「术」层面上的描述，对于大多数的个人播客制作者，尤其是以兴趣为出发点的制作者来说，往往看了一些指南以后，就「一时兴起」录制并上传了自己的第一期节目，然后经历了一段时间的「方兴未艾」后，在某个时间突然因为繁忙的工作打断了「周更」的节奏，于是「戛然而止」。我自己的节目《对讲鸡 RadioChicken》也经历过几次这样的过程，曾经我也对诸如断更和订阅数减少（即使现在小宇宙的订阅只有 300 多个，最近几十个还都是各种社交 app 认识的）感到失落甚至焦虑，但经历了一些列佛系的思考后，我发现制作播客对我自己的意义，完全不在于「向外展示性表达」，更多的喜悦和快乐，反而在于「向内探索性成长」。
所以今天我想就此分享一些关于「向内探索性成长」的心得，希望对于各位对于播客有兴趣，甚至已经开始制作播客的朋友有所启发。
降低期待
我给新人播客制作者的第一个建议，是做好「降低期待，甚至不要有期待」的心理建设。我相信可能会有部分朋友开始做播客的原因…</span>

Sure, indie hacker products are supposed to be scrappy, but I just LOVE that first step when you have a new idea.

The logo maker is on a pay-what-you-want basis*

*$1 minimum

Jota is a simple little ios app that allows you to store those links, recommendations and more forever in an easy to scan interface. 

Currently released just as an MVP on iOS we are hoping to release to Android and Chrome extensions soon! We also have a tonne of easy social sharing features too on the backlog. Let us know your thoughts!

在英特尔 2022 创新大会上的开幕致辞中，CEO Pat Gelsinger 将 Linus Torvalds 邀请到了台上，向他颁发了首个终身创新成就奖，并向他赠送了一本签名的关于 80386 开发的书。Pat 写的这本书让 Torvalds 对机器架构有了深入了解，并在后来的 Linux 内核代码开发工作中发挥了重要的作用。Torvalds 之前也得过其它奖项，如 2014 年 IEEE 计算机协会计算机先锋奖。

英特尔认为摩尔定律仍旧有效

之前我们报道过，英伟达的黄仁勋称，蛮力加晶体管的方法和摩尔定律的进步基本上已经走到了尽头。但英特尔 CEO 在周二的发布会上称，摩尔定律“依然有效”，英特尔正致力于推进制造工艺的进步，例如采用新的光刻技术和 RibbonFET 架构。他说，“我们希望从今天的单个封装上容纳大约1000亿个晶体管开始，到这个十年结束时实现在单个封装中加入一万亿个晶体管”。

Rust for Linux v10 补丁发布，预计合并到 Linux 6.1

v10 补丁主要是对以前的 v9 补丁的一些最小的修改，该补丁集包括 27 个补丁，共计 12.5 万行新代码。与之前相比，这是一个较小的 Rust 补丁系列，目的是为了更容易地实现合并到上游。一旦这项工作被主线化，使 Rust 支持更多的内核子系统和早期的 Rust 驱动就可以继续开发，并持续实现主线化。

老王点评：这回应该定了，主要是前几天内核开发者们开会达成了共识。</span>

                              <span>对开源的信任是一个正反馈循环。




这是我即将在 Wiley 出版的《计算和云计算中的信任Trust in Computing and the Cloud》一书中经过编辑的节选，也是我之前写的一篇文章《信任与选择开源》Trust &amp; choosing open source的延伸。

在那篇文章中，我提出了一个问题。当我们说 “我相信开放源码软件” 时，我们在做什么？作为回答，我认为，我们正在做的是确定有足够多的编写和测试该软件的人与我有类似的要求，而且他们的专业知识加在一起，使我使用该软件的风险可以接受。我同时也介绍了 “分布式信任distributed trust” 的概念。

在社区内分布信任的概念是亚里士多德提出的 “人群智慧理论wisdom of the crowd theory” 的应用，其中的假设是，许多人的意见通常比一个人或少数人的意见更有明智。虽然在某些情况下，最简单的形式显然是错误的 —— 最明显的例子是民众对极权主义政权的支持 —— 但这一原则可以为建立某些信息提供一个非常有效的机制。

我们称这种集体经验的提炼为“分布式信任”，它通过互联网上的许多机制收集。如 TripAdvisor 或 Glassdoor，记录了关于组织或其提供的服务的信息，还有像 UrbanSitter 或 LinkedIn，允许用户添加关于特定人的信息（例如，见 LinkedIn 的推荐和技能与个人档案中的认可部分）。从这些例子中可以获得的利益因网络效应而大大增加，因为随着成员数量的增加，成员之间可能的联系数量也成倍增加。

分布式信任的例子还包括像 Twitter 这样的平台，一个账户的追随者数量可以被视为衡量其声誉，甚至是衡量其可信度的标准，我们应该以强烈的怀疑态度去看待这种计算。事实上，Twitter 认为它必须解决拥有大量追随者的账户的社会力量问题，并…</span>

我的家庭实验室里有十几台物理计算机以及更多的虚拟机。这些系统中的大多数是我用来进行测试和实验的。我经常写使用自动化来简化系统管理任务的文章。我还在多个地方写过，我从自己的错误中学到的东西比几乎任何其他方式都多。

在过去的几周里，我学到了很多东西。

我给自己制造了一个大麻烦。作为多年的系统管理员，我写了数百篇关于 Linux 的文章和五本书，我应该对 Linux 更了解。话又说回来，我们都会犯错，这是一个重要的教训：你永远不会因为有经验而不犯错。

我不打算讨论我的错误的细节。告诉你这是一个错误就足够了，在我做之前我应该多考虑一下我在做什么。此外，细节并不是重点。经验不能让你免于犯下的每一个错误，但它可以帮助你恢复。这就是本文要讨论的内容：使用现场 USB 发行版启动并进入恢复模式。

问题

首先，我制造了问题，这本质上是 /etc/default/grub 文件的错误配置。接下来，我使用 Ansible 将错误配置的文件分发到我所有的物理计算机并运行 grub2-mkconfig。全部 12 个。这真的，真的很快。

除了两台之外，所有的都无法启动。它们在 Linux 启动的早期阶段崩溃，出现各种无法定位 /root 文件系统的错误。

我可以使用 root 密码进入“维护”模式，但是如果没有挂载 /root，即使是最简单的工具也无法访问。直接引导到恢复内核也不起作用。系统真的被破坏了。

Fedora 恢复模式

解决此问题的唯一方法是找到进入恢复模式的方法。当一切都失败时，Fedora 提供了一个非常酷的工具：用于安装 Fedora 新实例的现场 USBLive USB 驱动器。

                              <span>我的 AirPods Pro 2 还没发货，我的 AirPods Pro 1 已经吃灰很久。AirPods Pro 的耳塞我越来越戴不稳，再加上比较「白开水」的调音，以及削弱后的主动降噪效果，让我觉得虽然 AirPods Pro 综合体验不错，但总是少了点意思，对我这个 PC 玩家来说使用场景也有些窄。
在 PC 上玩游戏，我始终不喜欢用头戴耳机，太大一坨挂头上，戴久了累，耳朵闷，还压头发。习惯各种无线 TWS 之后，我也无法再适应回去用有线耳机，有根线扯着，会极大降低我起身活动的频率。所以 TWS 真无线耳塞一直是我的心头好。
以我常玩的 PUBG 为例，PC 桌面端能用来打游戏的真无线耳塞，至少必须得延迟够低，才有可能听声辨位，这样的耳塞市面上少之又少。所以很自然地，踩中我的喜好和需求的怒喵 CYBERBLADE 在发售后，我第一时间就上手并主力用了一段时间。所以这篇文章，我想分享一些我的体验感受。内容比较主观，没有受任一方干涉。
先说结论：抛开前期我也不喜欢的营销方式不谈，上手后的 CYBERBLADE 本身没有让我失望。它主打的桌面端体验不错，实物的质感挺好，佩戴舒适度和音质也有超出我预期，虽然缺点短板都有，但它确实可以称得上是我用过的最好的 PC 桌面端 TWS，而且，没有之一。
我是不是说得太满？请注意定语——「PC 桌面端 TWS」。就像我刚说的，PC 桌面端、能低延迟打游戏的真无线耳塞，市面上的可选项就没两个，这个垂直细分品类太小众，愿意像怒喵这样认真做一个偏高端定位好产品的厂商，更是没有。
你可以说怒喵只是在讨巧，从成熟的音频市场，挑了个没什么竞争的品类来做，没啥了不起；但对我这种目标受众来说，有人做了我需要的东西，并且除了核心的桌面低延迟游戏体验 OK 之外，还做出了别家没有的特色，就很棒。

CYBERBLADE 到底是个怎样的 TWS 耳机？

这篇文章将介绍，我为什么以及如何将自动化数据处理应用到 Notion 当中。并通过我实际的案例，介绍自动化工具 Zapier 的用法，分享我的使用体验。
数据更新和维护的不智能，让 Notion 的使用体验变得糟糕
随着 Notion 功能的不断完善，越来越多的人会选择使用 Notion 作为自己的第二大脑。无论是构建个人的知识网络、保存整理数据信息、还是展示自己的数字世界的成就，这些场景中，Notion 提供的功能都显得游刃有余。此外，得益于 Notion 可以高度个人定制化以及提供在线编辑的特性，用 Notion 管理待办事项，规划日程，同步团队信息，乃至于记账、写博客这种更进阶的用法，使用 Notion 都可以让数据为用户服务，一切变得井井有条。
操作的不便
但是，所谓凡事有一利就有一弊。在 Notion 当中构建的精巧且复杂的数据库，不仅意味着数据在展示层面上的美观和应用层面上的便利，同时也意味着需要在数据的更新维护上花更多的时间和精力。
按照我自己的使用习惯，我在 Notion 当中搭建了任务管理的数据库和财务管理的数据库。这其中有着大量的数字格式的数据存储在其中。但是因为 Notion 当中并不支持直接将数据进行运算得出结果
例如，数字一栏记录的值是 100，并不能通过直接填写 「+10」得到 110，数字数据的更新是需要删除原有的数据，并把计算好的新结果填入原来的位置。

在 PC 端或网页端，这样的操作还勉强可以接受，但是在手机的 App 上，这样的操作就显得过于麻烦。更…</span>

武汉水系图
沿江而行
如果你来武汉的时间只有一天，那去江边走上一天，便可以心中有谱地说出：我去过武汉了。那些或声势显赫或寂寂无名的景色，许许多多便是散布在长江汉水之畔的。
汉口江滩
漫步路线：江汉路-江汉关-武汉科学技术馆-汉口江滩
江汉路
每个城市里都有一条名号最响的路，在北京是王府井大街，在上海是南京路，在广州是上下九，在武汉自然就是江汉路了，江汉路很长，它的一头伸到了江边，另一头连着解放大道，被誉为「天下第一步行街」。江汉路在清末时期叫做广利巷，是商人集资修建来往贸易之用的。1861 年，汉口开埠之后，洋人也是看中了这里的临江的交通便利之处，便在广利巷附近的地盘上相继建立租界，江汉路便逐渐形成。现今江汉路著名的建筑，即是当年各个租界遗留的场所。
江汉路沿路与江汉一、二、三路，黎黄陂路，保成路，水塔街等道路相连。弯弯绕绕，一转身，便可以看到不同风景。黎黄陂路是旧时汉口俄租界上的街道改造而成，作为一条拥有百年历史的老路，黎黄陂路见证着滚滚的历史车轮从此经过，漫步在这里，主要体会宁静，在老时光咖啡馆里享受一段悠然时光，在小物商行里欣赏别出心裁的饰件，或是在路上发发呆，看一看那些时不时提着婚纱走过的新人。保成路是承袭了几十年不断演变的夜市，短短几百米的道路上承载了近千家小商贩，漫步在这里…</span>

从这里开始
目前我在用的笔记系统，用一句很简单的话概括就是：本地 markdown 文件 + Dropbox 网盘同步，同时用 Vscode 项目把整个笔记目录管理起来。
大概几年前，我正在 Evernote 、有道云笔记、OneNote 之间反复横跳。当时还没有 Notion，也没有 Roam Research，甚至 PKM（个人知识管理）都很少有人提及。
最后还是选择了本地 markdown 这种「看似不便」的方式，毕竟原生的 markdown有种种缺点（图片管理、没有 Metadata、不支持复杂排版），本地文件的方式摆脱不了树状文件夹的笔记结构……甚至在当时缺少非常顺手的编辑器。但这些年修修补补也一直用下来了，上面提到的种种缺点也都改善或规避，期间也尝试过 Notion、RoamResearch、Logseq，但这种 「基于本地 markdown」的笔记一直都是我的笔记系统基本盘。

 
这种方案的好处是：

数据完全属于自己，Dropbox 网盘 + 自己写的定时脚本备份到 Git ，双重措施可以确保笔记不会丢失，也能通过 Git 的历史追溯修改历史、查看笔记系统的生长过程；
最好的同步体验（Dropbox） + 最好的现代编辑器（Vscode）：Dropbox 的多设备同步近乎实时，并且增量同步非常适合 markdown 这种轻量文本，如果上网不便可以用坚果等其他同步盘替代，如果你用 苹果全家桶且能忍受 iCloud Drive 的同步1，它也是可以的 。至于最好的编辑器……还是看个人习惯吧，现代的编辑器诸如 Su…</span>

                              <span>使用 Obsidian 的过程中发现一些痛点：
1&gt; 使用插件 annotator 时，引用的文本内不能添加链接

如果强行将关键字改成链接，就会出现格式错乱

我想要的效果如下：引用的文本能够给添加链接

2&gt; 使用简悦剪藏文章时 ，文章内的图片是外链。如果图片是外链，那么如果外链链接失效了就找不回图片了

我想要的效果如下：将外链转为图床的链接

3&gt; Media Extended 虽然能使用链接跳转到视频指定时间点，但是手写链接太麻烦了

我想要的效果：自动生成一个视频的全部字幕和引用，且每句字幕和一点时间点引用呈一一对应的关系

❗❗❗为了节省大家的时间，我在文末写了我常用的 Obsidian 插件的下载链接，这些插件中有部分插件的源码都是被我修改过的，有两个需要注意的事项：

被我修改过源码的插件不全是可以直接用的，比如发送图片到 Picgo 时的 url 要换成你在 Picgo 内设置的 url
修改过源码的插件不要升级，如果升级了会导致修改失效

❗❗❗再附加一个注意事项：

入门简悦的时候如果运气不好（比如我），会遇到很多问题，如果看了入门文章还是解决不了就到 https://github.com/Kenshin/simpread/issues 提交自己的问题，简悦的开发者回复消息还是挺快的（顺便夸夸开发者很积极，这很难得）

修改 annotator 引用格式
使用工具
Annotator：是一个用于给 pdf 做标注和跳转的开源插件
Linter：是一个用于格式化笔记的开源插件
配置 Linter
目标：修改其源代码，添加将 Annotator 样式修改为 📌
添加规则分类：

添加具体的规则处理：

代码如下：

                              <span>喜欢阅读漫画书吗？有 大量可用于 Linux 的漫画阅读器。

但是，为日漫Manga量身定做的东西呢？

我想我找到了一个适合阅读漫画的完美应用，它可以管理它们，也可以下载它们进行离线使用。我最近发现的这个应用叫做 Kommiku。

让我提一下这个应用的主要亮点，并帮助你在 Linux 上开始使用它。

Komikku: 一个 Linux 专用的日漫阅读器



Komikku 是一个开源的日漫阅读器，且仅有 Linux 应用。

它主要是为配合 GNOME 桌面环境而定制的，但你也可以在运行 其他桌面环境 的 Linux 发行版上使用它。

许多 PDF 或 电子书阅读器，如 Bookworm、Calibre 和 Foliate 都支持漫画书格式。

然而，Komikku 用户会有更多的功能，以获得阅读漫画的良好体验。



例如，Komikku 可在线和离线观看日漫。此外，你可以从支持的服务器上下载它。

Komikku 的特点

Komikku 的一些最佳功能包括：


从几十个支持的服务器进行在线阅读。

离线阅读已下载的日漫。

按类别组织你的日漫库。

从右到左、从左到右、垂直和网络漫画阅读模式。

几种类型的导航（键盘方向键、通过鼠标左右滑动或点击（触摸板/触摸屏）、滚轮和滑动手势（触摸板和触摸屏）。

自动更新漫画。

自动下载新章节。

阅读历史。

浅色和深色主题。

自适应设计（能够从桌面工作站扩展到移动电话）。

键盘快捷键。




安装

Komikku 可在 Flathub 上找到。因此，你可以把它安装在任何 Linux 发行版上。

不过，你需要 在你的系统上设置 Flatpak 并启用 Flathub 仓库。

当你在系统上设置了 Flatpak，你可以通过软件中心搜索它，或者从你的终端安装它。



要使用终端安装 Komikku，请输入以下命令：

flatpak install flathub info.febvre.Komikku


Komikku 的原生包也可用于 Arch Linux 和 Fedora 等发行版。以下是安装它们的命令：

对于 Arch Linux（在 AUR 中可用）：

yay -Syu komikku


对于 Fedora（在官方仓库中可用）：

sudo dnf install komikku


在其 GitLab 页面上可以查看 Komikku 的源代码以及从源代码构建它的说明。可以前往其官方网页了解更多信息。


下载 Komikku


总结

我发现 Komikku 非常直观干净。我注意到在线服务器并不总是工作，经常有一些小故障，但管理离线漫画和将你的藏品分类是毫不费力的。

所有这些都要感谢 Valéry Febvre（Komikku 的开发者），我们有了另一个有用的 Linux 应用。如果你喜欢这个应用，你可以考虑向该项目捐款。

你使用哪种漫画书阅读器？你会尝试 Komikku 吗？请在下面的评论中告诉我你的想法。

老王点评：看来 Linux 内核中的这种遗留问题也不少啊，毕竟作为一个 30 年的项目，已经庞大到很难全面了解的程度了。




OpenAI 开源多语言语音识别系统

OpenAI 开源了 Whisper，这是一个自动语音识别系统，该公司声称可以实现多种语言的 “鲁棒” 转录，以及从这些语言翻译成英语。OpenAI 称，Whisper 的与其它的语音识别系统的同之处在于，它是在 68 万小时的多语言和 “多任务” 数据基础上训练出来的，这些数据从网络上收集而来，从而提高了对独特口音、背景噪音和技术术语的识别。

老王点评：可能会有更智能的语音助手出现，毕竟这是开源了的。




勒索软件开始摧毁数据而不是加密数据

研究人员发现，至少有一个勒索软件团伙正在试验一种新的攻击方式，这种方式不是加密数据，而是直接摧毁数据。其目的是使受害者在不支付赎金的情况下无法获取到他们的数据。摧毁数据比加密数据更简单，也可以避免加密数据被解密，因而致使受害者更容易支付赎金。


消息来源：ZDNet



老王点评：这要比以前的勒索软件更危险，所以，作为底线，无论如何，勤备份。</span>

                              <span>如今，Mac 应用商店正在售卖 LibreOffice。难道它不是免费的吗？我们来了解一下个中缘由。




LibreOffice 是一个自由、开源、跨平台的办公套件。

所以它一直是 微软 Office 的最佳免费替代品。

如果事实的确如此, 我现在怎么会在这里讨论 LibreOffice 的购买呢？

文档基金会计划向市场推出这个项目以筹集资金，

如今文档基金会正在努力改进营销策略，鼓励人们支持 LibreOffice 的发展。

当然，发布企业版是他们能做到的最好方式之一。

但是，能否通过提供相似的服务，把这种机会扩展到终端用户呢？

最方便的办法 是像 Mac 应用商店那样，通过专有渠道销售 LibreOffice。

最近，文档基金会 宣布 在 Mac 应用商店销售 LibreOffice；他们是这么说的：


跟以前的情况相比，文档基金会在 Mac 应用商店发布软件的举措是一次变革，这是一种新的市场策略：文档基金会专注于社区版的发布，而属于相关生态系统的公司专注于针对企业用户的、长期提供支持服务以及能够带来价值增值的版本。


很多用户信赖并依靠的是自己平台的官方应用商店。因此，在他们的官方应用商店销售 LibreOffice 能起到方便用户的作用。你可以自动将 LibreOffice 更新为最新版本，而无需每次更新时下载相应的版本。



为了享受从 Mac 应用商店下载 LibreOffice 的便利，你需要一次性付费购买。

它在 Mac 应用商店的卖价是 8.99 美元。


你仍然可以在 LibreOffice 网站 上免费下载 Mac 版 LibreOffice。


Mac 应用商店不是已经可以下载了吗？



嗯，是，也不是。

Collabora Office（基于 LibreOffice 的企业版）在 Mac 应用商店售价是 8.99 美元。

它基于 LibreOffice，并不完全是 LibreOffice 的社区版本。所以现在，文档基金会在 Mac 应用商店推出了社区版。

他们也在告示中提到：


“我们感谢 Collabora 公司长期以来在 Mac 应用商店对 LibreOffice 的支持”

- Italo Vignoli，LibreOffice 市场营销团队


（LCTT 校注：也就是说，文档基金会在 Mac 应用商店推出的 LibreOffice 是无商业支持的社区版，和具有商业支持的、基于企业版定制的 Collabora Office 的售价一样。因此，这种行为可看作是文档基金会的某种自愿募捐方式 —— 如果不愿意捐助，你可以继续下载免费版本。）

这笔费用对 LibreOffice 有何帮助？

截至目前，LibreOffice 已成为一个大型开源项目。很多 Linux 发行版中默认自带 LibreOffice，这并不奇怪，一些教育机构也决定使用 LibreOffice，从而取代微软 Office。

当然，它可能在某种意义上并不完美。但是它正在不断取得进步，能满足用户关于文档、表格或演示文稿方面的基本功能。

所以，收取的费用将用于项目的支持工作，可以覆盖项目的维护成本和远期用于支付贡献者和文档基金会工作人员的相关费用。

微软应用商店也会推出 LibreOffice 吗？



微软应用商店现在并不直接提供 LibreOffice。

在微软应用商店，你可以以 14.99 美元的价格购买 Collabora Office。但是，文档基金会还没有发布官方的社区版。

还有 Allo Office，以前被称为 LibreOffice Vanilla。

也许在它登陆 Mac 应用商店之后，他们可能会把它引入微软商店。

💬 对于在 Mac 应用商店购买 LibreOffice，你怎么看？

JavaScript is a rich language, with sometimes a seemingly overwhelming number of libraries and frameworks. With so many options available, it&#x27;s sometimes useful to just look at the language itself and keep in mind its core components. This glossary covers the core JavaScript language, syntax, and functions.
JavaScript variables
var: The most used variable. Can be reassigned but only accessed within a function, meaning function scope. Variables defined with var move to the top when code is executed.
const: Cannot be reassigned and not accessible before they appear within the code, meaning block scope.
let: Similar to const with block scope, however, the let variable can be reassigned but not re-declare…</span>

The year was 2020, and news about COVID-19 came flooding in so quickly that everyone felt completely overwhelmed with similar news articles providing updates with varying degrees of accuracy.
But all I needed to know was when my official government guidelines changed. In the end, that&#x27;s all that mattered to me.
Whether the concern is a pandemic or just the latest tech news, keeping ahead of changes in website content can be critical.
The changedetection.io project provides a simple yet highly capable, open source solution for website change detection and notification. It&#x27;s easy to set up, and it can notify over 70 (and counting) different notification systems, such as Matrix, M…</span>

                              <span>Product-led: Unlike most of our competitors, we’re actually product-led! You can go right to our website and get started within minutes. We’ve made a lot of investments in a great self-service experience. No more waiting for someone to respond to your “requested a demo” form. 

🕹 Arcade Play: We rebuilt our Chrome extension to automatically make video snippets based on actions such as scrolling, drag and drop, and entering text. Press “Record Demo” in our extension to see what we mean! 

🥁 Interactive emails and GIFs: We’ve doubled down on our GTM user base who love embedding Arcades inside of homepages, emails, social media and onboarding flows. Since launching, we’ve redesigned our chrome extension to create interactive video based on user actions, and we now support interactive Arcades inside of Gmail, Outlook, Superhuman, and Github! We also allow you to export Arcades as GIFs if you want to promote across channels. 

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦  Arcade Teams: If you are a creator and want to collaborate with others inside your company, check out our new Arcade Teams product (in beta). We have signed contracts with Atlassian, Carta, Sentry, AngelList and many more! 

🎨  A completely redesigned UI: We gave our product a nice facelift with our new design language.  



We’re also one of the easiest interactive demo tools to use. Our median time to publish is 7m. We have a generous free tier as well. Try it out for yourself: http://arcade.software/.

                              <span>在以前的文章中，我对笔记软件和写作软件按照类别进行了梳理，参见《盘点那些具有特色的笔记软件》、《盘点那些具有特色的写作软件》。今天承接这一系列，介绍《盘点那些具有特色的电子白板软件》。
在思维导图、概念图之外，白板作为一种强大的思维辅助工具，正在日益流行。为什么很多人喜欢白板呢？
为什么需要白板？

自由。白板没有过多的束缚。就像在一张白纸一样。你可以在空白页面随心所欲地表达你的思想。
可视化。只需要使用画笔、文本框等模块以及模版，快速地将你地思维过程和想法以图文组合地方式加以表达。

事实上，白板也并非什么新鲜事务。很多公司一直在使用实体白板进行开会等活动。如今，随着工作方式的改变，人们在远程工作、远程教育等场景中迫切需要电子白板工具。
那么，如何选择适合自己的电子白板软件呢？我根据对于白板软件的使用需求，依次介绍本地离线的白板软件、免费/好用的在线白板软件、在线协作的白板软件，以满足对白板软件从轻量级到重量级等不同程度的需求。此外，还介绍两种与白板相关、特殊类型的工具：介于白板和笔记之间的可视化知识管理工具、内置白板模块的笔记软件。
本地离线的白板软件
Microsoft Whiteboard 微软出品的免费白板软件
官网：Microsoft Whiteboard 官网

介绍：协作式数字画布，可实现有效会议和互动学习。
优点：微软出品，免费、强大。并且，可以与微软 Office 软件生态进行整合。
Apple Freeform 苹果正在开发的白板应用
Freeform 提供了一个“灵活的画布”，参与者可以在其中将文本、照片、绘图、PDF 和其他内容添加到单个空间中。该应用程序与 Messages 和 FaceTime 密切相关。Freeform 可以在 FaceTime 通话期间启动，并且通过 Messages 反映协作内容。具体发布时间未知，预计首先登录 iPadO…</span>

                              <span>2020年的时候，我开始对「知识管理」产生兴趣，一路寻找适合自己的工具和方法。经过近两年的探索，我终于找到了答案——通过 wolai 平台来实践L先生的「INK-P 管理法」，借此搭建属于自己的知识体系。（注：L先生，即公众号「L先生说」的作者 Lachel李睿秋，也是我的老师。下文统一称呼「L先生」）
先给大家展示我去年的一个成果——《御赐小仵作》资料整理。大家可以看看下面这几张动图：

《御赐小仵作》是去年的一部古装悬疑连续剧，算得上是暑期档的最大黑马了。该剧的情节、设定和诸多细节都很讲究，所以我觉得有必要整理一番。一来是出于自己对这部作品的喜爱，二来是想让制作团队的用心能让更多人看到。
去年6月的时候我开始整理，本以为只需要一两个星期，实则大大低估了它的工作量。我那会每天大概抽出半个小时，磨了整整5个月才完成。不过虽然是挺累的，但整理完还是倍有成就感。这次的整理大致分为5个模块：

每集的剧情脉络
剧中重要人物的介绍
相关的历史背景和知识
唐代的官职制度
剧中所涉及的知识点

这几部分主要是通过 wolai 的「双向链接」和「嵌入引用」来实现联动。
比如第一集的剧情这里，红色的部分是双向链接，引用的有人物也有知识点。跳转到人物界面之后，可以看到 ta 的简介，以及相关的经历。人物经历下面通过「嵌入引用」，把剧情里的信息链接过来。因为这部剧的主旋律是验尸和破案，所以几个主角的经历还会分出「工作成果」这一部分。

wolai 是国内开发的一个云端协作平台，用来搭建知识体系也很适合。
2018年的时候我就开始搭建自己的数据库，从最初的印象笔记，到后来的 Onenote 和 Notion，一步步探索，最后在2020年选择了 wolai。

掐指一算，试播集 已经暂别我们两个多月了，在没有南哥发车的这些日子里，我攒了不少读书笔记，决定自发的搞一期 “备播集”，大约等同于电视台里没节目可播的时候强行凑数的节目。
本期车长：@kokdemo

如果大家对这样的形式喜闻乐见，也欢迎在各种渠道找到我，大家一起攒读书笔记并发出来，希望能坚持到试播集回来的那一天。最后也感谢南哥对本文头图的大力支持。

@kokdemo 创业者们的自述
最近看到了巴塔哥尼亚创始人决定把公司“捐给地球1”的新闻，让我感到颇为震撼，在看完新闻之后，我立马去阅读了巴塔哥尼亚创始人伊冯·乔伊纳德所著的《冲浪板上的公司》这本书。
巴塔哥尼亚官网的公告-地球是我们唯一的股东
在读完这本书之后，我对这家公司的文化和理念十分敬佩，于是打算将这一段时间读过的一些公司创始人所写的书放在一起，和大家聊一聊。

                              <span>你有没有想过一个问题：为什么心理学家都喜欢拿老鼠做实验？
一般来说会找一只涉世未深的小白鼠，然后把它放到一个箱子里，还会给它准备一些食物，但是食物会连上老鼠可操控的开关，并且加上电击、喂食等各种条件变量，然后通过设计不同的机制，来看老鼠最后的反应，最后老鼠会因此习得一些惯性的行为模式。
实验完成后，心理学家会把老鼠的这些行为反应总结成规律，然后应用和解释人类的行为和心理机制。
这些实验结论都有一个隐含的前提，那就是老鼠的心智模式在某种情况下，等同于人类的心智模式：都是通过先做一些行为，然后从现实世界获取「反馈」，然后建立对世界的「预测」机制，直到最后形成了一个「稳定」的行为模式。
为什么我们一定要经过反馈、预测、稳定的路径？因为不管是人类，还是老鼠，我们都会遵循一种固定的模式——心智模式。

心智模式是我们简化世界后的知识结构和认知表征，我们常用它来与世界进行互动。
——百度百科

人类如果要在现实世界中生存，就需要认识并且适应所处的不断变化的环境。我们能够通过五官觉察身边的环境，通过短时的记忆去存储一段时间已经发生的变化，然后通过思维去归纳和预测还未发生的变化，最后形成一套自己的心智模式。
可以说，我们只要想在这个世界上好好地活，就离不开我们的心智模式。
我们可以将现实世界投射在心智之中，但是尽管穷尽一生，我们的心智世界也只能涵盖真实世界的很小一部分。
很多时候，我们以为的真实世界其实并不真实。
心智以外的“真实”世界
楚门望着看起来一望无际的大海，不知道海的对面是一堵天蓝色的墙，墙上的楼梯能够通往现实世界。原来自己不过是一个被设定好的角色，眼前的一切都是人造的虚幻。如果周边的环境都是假的，那“我”还是真的吗？

作为观察楚门的看客，我们知道他身处的世界是假的，但我们怎么知道没有人在观察我们？也许是我们的灵魂？或者有某种更广泛的神秘的存在在操控我们的命运。

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://sspai.com/post/75931">
                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">
                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>在正式开始教程之前首先说明一下目前国行系统的状态：最新版三星云（5.2.00.5）屏蔽了OneDrive备份的入口，直接删除了相关备份软件的服务。因此要在国行系统机器上继续使用OneDrive备份需要降级三星云。如果对Samsung Pay没有需求而对同步有比较大的需求，最简单的方法是刷港版系统。本教程基于One UI 4.1，国行S20。所有需要的安装包均可在教程链接或者apkmirror网站上找到。
在开始之前需要的准备：一个非大陆地区的三星账号，一个微软账号（需要是个人账号），一个非国行系统的三星手机（也可以是你的国行设备刷港版系统），以及一部国行系统的三星手机（操作对象）。
第一步，绑定三星账号和微软账户。
在非国行系统的手机上登录三星账号，然后在相册的设置里，找到云同步，点击按照提示登录微软账户。其中某些步骤容易因为网络原因卡住，不过由于我从来没遇到过，所以有需求的建议在酷安上搜索相关资料，或者全程科学网络。这一步很简单，因此不做过多阐述。
第二步，降级三星云。
一般来说，国行系统的三星云会被强制自动更新，因此要想使用备份需要先降级三星云。
目前在apkmirror上找到能安装也能备份的最新版是5.1.00.13，由于版本号相比国行最新版三星云5.1.05.9更低，需要重新安装。可以现在系统里卸载三星云，再安装此版本的三星云。如果不想重新同步之前的云数据，可以使用ADB直接降级安装。代码我放在下面（为了方便输入，包名我改成了123.apk）
adb install -r -d D:\123.apk
第三步，在国行设备上进行后续操作。
登录账号之后，下载一个OneDrive，登录之前和三星账户绑定的那个微软账户。登录成功之后就可以暂时忽略这个软件。然后按照链接里的方法在手机上安装lycan，这一步是关键，否则之后的操作都无法进行。

下载「创建快捷方式」这个软件
【创建快捷方式】 ，打开之后右上角三个点勾选「也显示系统应用」，搜索三星云。点击进入三星云的活动列表，搜索「dashboard」，找到图中这个活动，然后创建一个快捷方式放在桌面。

如果此时打开这个快捷方式，会进入OneDrive同步的那个页面，但是会提示三星云需要更新才能同步，如果不更新就会强制退出。所以我们需要用到lycan屏蔽这个更新提示。
打开lycan，搜索三星云，在「服务」中将uploadtodrive两项设置成enable

在「接收器」中将下图三项禁用，三项名字均带有update

在「服务」中打开下图两项

此时重新打开刚刚那个快捷方式，就能够正常同步了。
成功效果如图

如果之后打开三星云又提示更新，可以按照之前的方法降级三星云。不排除之后的系统更新会屏蔽这个接口的可能，只能说且用且珍惜。</span>

Open source software (OSS), once a niche segment of the development landscape, is now ubiquitous. This growth is fantastic for the open source community. However, as the usage of OSS increases, so do concerns about security. Especially in mission-critical applications— think medical devices, automobiles, space flight, and nuclear facilities—securing open source technology is of the utmost priority. No individual entity, whether developers, organizations, or governments, can single-handedly solve this problem. The best outcome is possible when all of them come together to collaborate.
The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) formed to facilitate this collaboration. Ope…</span>

                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">

                              <span>时间切片 Time Slice 是延时摄影的静态表现形式：你通过固定机位并在特定的时间间隔内拍摄一系列照片，得到一组静态照片，然后在后期的时候按照时间顺序，取每一张照片的局部，然后拼接起来，便得到一个名为时间切片的照片。
2022 年 7 月份在梧桐山顶拍摄了一组日落时分的延时照片，并在后期导入电脑并使用 DaVinci Resolve 合成延时视频的时候，我突然想起一个朋友在 2013 年输出的一个时间切片照片。于是也想给我这组照片制作一个时间切片。
后期制作时间切片是一道很复杂的工程（比如，可以参考这里），随着照片数目的增多，操作步骤会越多。在正式使用 Photoshop 尝试制作时间切片之前，我就直接有个想法，要不自己实现一把？
事实上，使用程序来实现一点都不难：给一组照片排好序后，在一个大的画布上，依次取该照片特定的区域，然后绘制到该画布的同样的区域就能实现这种效果。最开始我是在 Android 上进行这块的测试，后来很快就完成并验证了效果的可用性。后来想了下，MyerTidy 虽然目前的功能只有「整理文件」，但它实际上是可以定位为一个「批量处理」的 app。
最后便有了 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新（暂时只有 macOS 版本）。
此版本带来以下的变化：

重新设计的带响应式布局的首页，为未来支持更多批量操作进行前置的支持
新增各个模式的功能介绍以及效果图
支持「延时切片」功能，正如上文所说的，可以为你制作时间切片照片。在下文会做更详细的介绍
进行了小部分重构和性能优化

在首页选择了「延时切片」后，你便可以选择一个文件夹或者一组照片了，之后会自动进行预览渲染：

 
默认的效果是，根据你的文件名升序排序，从左到右，不对图片进行采样来进行绘制。
比如你有文件名为 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg 到 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg 的 100 张图片，会使用以下顺序从左到右来绘制：

绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg
绘制 TIMELAPSE_002.jpg
…
绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg

效果如上。
 
你可以点击「倒序处理」，来使用倒序的方式来从左到右绘制：

绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg
绘制 TIMELAPSE_099.jpg
…
绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg

效果如下：

 
如果你觉得你的图片太多了，想以固定的间隔来取一部分来绘制，那么可以在「跳过合成的数目」来输入你要跳过的数目 X。也就是，每隔 X 张，只会取一张来绘制。

跳过的数目为 5 的情况下，每 5 张会选择第一张来绘制。
对于上述图片，跳过数目设定为 50 的时候（原图片总数目为 654 张）效果如下：

 
最后，上述的布局方式都是「水平布局」：图片以水平方向来进行绘制。
你可以点击「垂直布局」，来开启从上到下的绘制模式，效果如下：

此外特别注意的一点是，MyerTidy 目前不支持图片自动对齐。因此如果你的图片组因为前期拍摄的原因有部分图片对不齐，那么需要你先使用 Photoshop 等工具来前期做对齐（当然，相比做时间切片来说，应该不算太困难）。如果需求强烈，那么可能会调研并加入这块的支持。
以上便是 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新。未来会专注 macOS 下对文件和图片的「批处理」的实现，目前期望会做的下一个大功能便是对文件按照特定的规则批量重命名（比如整理番剧之类的，会很有用），也在思考是否可以加入类似「星轨合成」这样的功能。
你可以通过 App Store 搜索 MyerTidy 来进行下载。如果你有什么想法和反馈，欢迎留言。</span>

                              <span>1. 两个让我困惑的迷思
在双链笔记兴起后，PKM 领域一直热衷于谈论知识与知识间的联系构建。于是我们经常听到一种流行的讲法：我们的思维方式是网状的，笔记也应如此，传统的文件夹与目录分类已是旧时代的产物。
这种讲法忽视了两个前提：
并不是所有人都有能力在知识间构建联系，尤其对于一个领域的初学者来说；
大脑神经元虽然以网状的形式呈现，但人类的思考方式本质上仍然是结构化的；
20 世纪 50 年代，芝加哥大学教授布鲁姆提出教育目标分类理论，该理论将人类对于知识的认知分为了六个层次：

记忆：对具体事实、概念、术语的回忆；
理解：能够对知识进行转换、解释和推断；
应用：在实际情景中运用知识；
分析：将所学材料分解，明白各部分间的联系；
评价：基于对知识的理解，对知识的价值进行有效判断；
创造：将组成知识的各部分要素重新加工，产生新的模式或结构；

按照布鲁姆的分类理论，知识间如果要产生关联，对于知识的认知必须要达到分析的层次。在实际应用中，我们也许可以跳过记忆和应用，将认知过程的前四步简化为理解-&gt;分析，然而这仍然要求我们对知识有充分的吸收和了解。
以语法为例，若我们想要厘清中、英文之间的差异，则必先以其中一种语言作为理解的锚点。对一方的语法有所了解后，才可借此反思与另一方语言的相同、区别。
如此，作为一个初学者，若对两种语言皆不通晓，自然很难有相互关联的能力。再者，一个领域本身有其自身的框架，初学者面对新知尚且招架不住，更遑论还要再负担额外的功夫去思考相关性。
更令人困惑的迷思在于，当我们谈论联系时，我们总是通过网的比喻来形容知识的关联性。

Databases are tools to store information in an organized but flexible way. A spreadsheet is essentially a database, but the constraints of a graphical application render most spreadsheet applications useless to programmers. With Edge and IoT devices becoming significant target platforms, developers need powerful but lightweight solutions for storing, processing, and querying large amounts of data. One of my favourite combinations is the PostgreSQL database and Lua bindings, but the possibilities are endless. Whatever language you use, Postgres is a great choice for a database, but you need to know some basics before adopting it.

To install PostgreSQL on Linux, use your software repository. …</span>

Distributed databases are common for many reasons. They increase reliability, redundancy, and performance. Apache ShardingSphere is an open source framework that enables you to transform any database into a distributed database. Since the release of ShardingSphere 5.0.0, DistSQL (Distributed SQL) has provided dynamic management for the ShardingSphere ecosystem.
In this article, I demonstrate a data sharding scenario in which DistSQL&#x27;s flexibility allows you to create a distributed database. At the same time, I show some syntax sugar to simplify operating procedures, allowing your potential users to choose their preferred syntax.

When you write an application, it&#x27;s common to require data storage. Sometimes you&#x27;re storing assets your application needs to function, and other times you&#x27;re storing user data, including preferences and save data. One way to store data is in a database, and in order to communicate between your code and a database, you need a database binding or connector for your language. For Java, a common database connector is JDBC (Java database connectivity.)
1. Install Java
Of course, to develop with Java you must also have Java installed. I recommend SDKman for Linux, macOS, and WSL or Cygwin. For Windows, you can download OpenJDK from developers.redhat.com.

                              <span>在这个大众觉醒的时代，我们常常听到「我们需要探索自我，了解自己」。但是，假设我们很粗暴地把人分为三种：认为不需要寻找自我的人（或不知道「寻找自我」重要性的人）、正在寻找自我的人、以及找到了自我的人，第一类人是绝大多数，第二类是少数，第三类是少数中的少数。
这其实也对应了我们认识自我的三个阶段。
第一阶段是我们需要觉醒，意识到探索自我的重要性。
为什么探索自我对每个人都很重要？
人是需要意义驱动的动物，我们天生有实现自身价值的冲动。但每个人的价值、优势是不同的。我的性格是怎样的？我想做的事情是什么？对我来说，什么最重要？我未来的方向是什么？我想过上怎么样的生活？我的价值实现在哪？这些问题如果得不到解答，短短一生很容易忙忙碌碌、随着大流就这样过去了，实在可惜。
项飙在《把自己作为方法》中说：

（瓶颈的问题）是回到自己作为一个边缘者、回到我是谁的问题。想清楚究竟我能做什么，我跟世界的关系是什么。我认为世界上所有的人都有这个问题，都得搞清楚自己是谁，否则都会有这种危机，除非完全盲目地被主流裹挟进去。

当我们意识到探索自我的需求之后，我们还需要方法，这就来到了第二阶段——开始寻找自我。但我感觉，很多人对于探索自我的方法却没有什么头绪。
困难之处，在于「自我」是非常复杂的，我们之所以是今天这样，受到了童年经历、社交媒体、朋友亲人、国家文化等等各种因素的影响，这些影响之中大部分更是在日常不知不觉之中就成为了我们的一部分，所以无论是从横向（各种因素的复杂性）和纵向（性格和价值观形成过程的复杂性）看，自我都是极其复杂的。
但好在，这几年通过各种各样的渠道和自证，我积累了一些有用的、可执行的方法，想在这里分享给你。
再多读几本书
阅读有什么用呢？学习知识肯定是好处之一，可是看完可能就忘了；拓展眼界也是的，可是没去亲身经历还是差了一点。
那最大的用处是什么呢？我认为， 是读自己。

Alan Formy-Duval

Setting up Git on Linux is simple, but here are the five things I do to get the perfect configuration:
Create global configuration
Set default name
Set default email address
Set default branch name
Set default editor
I manage my code, shell scripts, and documentation versioning using Git. This means that for each new project I start, the first step is to create a directory for its content and make it into a Git repository:
$ mkdir newproject
cd newproject
git init

                              <span>个人日程管理的需求
在选择日程管理的形式或者app的时候，我的要求很简单：即先确定需求，再按照需求探索日程管理方式。我对日程管理的需求有几点：

任务与日程要在同一个页面；
尽可能随手拿起就能使用；
有较大的自由度，即可以根据个人需求添加备注等；
要能够自上而下地「俯视」整个日程管理过程；
随时可以逃离。

根据这几点需求，我开始了自己的日程管理尝试1。
日程管理尝试
1. 纸质日程本
本科时期，还在用着黑莓9790、z10等一些「非主流」手机，他们没办法与电脑形成一个良好的生态系统，所以没有习惯用他们来做日程管理，而是使用传统的纸质日程本。
当时，已经在用Moleskine的单行笔记本做日记本，对M家的本子很有好感，尤其是口袋本，非常便携。出于一种仪式感的传承，我开始尝试M家的周记本：本子摊开，左边是一周的日程记录，可以记录有确定时间的日程，也可以记录只固定日期的日程；右边是一整面的横线页面，可以写下一些备忘事项，例如可能需要本周或者下周要做的事情等，也可以记录本周的一些打卡事项。

后来尝试了M家特有的400页超厚日程本，一天一页，每一页都是当天从8点到22点的日程记录。本子非常厚，携带有点不方便；记录是方便许多，能写的位置也多了很多，但因为不是每天都有排满的日程，一些琐事写进去也没意思，最终本子留了许多空，总感觉有点浪费，尤其是年终总结的时候觉得似乎是虚度了时光一样。

后来也尝试过MUJI的月记本，但是总感觉没有周记本好用，我便回归Moleskine的周记本，直到我后来舍弃它。
2. 手机自带日程管理工具
舍弃纸质日程本的原因有两个：

设备和系统升级了，从「非主流」机升级到了带有安卓系统的Blackberry Keyone，自带的日历强大了很多；
当时正在读研究生，我们的课比谁都多，每天都被课程排满，而这些课程都写进纸质笔记本里不太可能，只把课程外的待办事项写进本…</span>

                              <span>上一篇《exping：一个地图创作工具是怎么诞生的？》 和大家分享了 exping 的诞生故事后。感谢大家的支持与建议，也感谢少数派的推荐，让更多的人认识了 exping ，其中也有投资人、媒体关注到了我们。这是意料之外的收获。时隔3个月，我们有了许多的变化与提升。在这段时间里，也有更多的机会去接触用户，进行深入的交流，从中也更清晰我们的产品定位，以及我们的使命。
「地图」就像一张画布，是另类的创作载体
从地图诞生以来，大家对地图的认识，更多是作为「导航指引」用途。其中涉及了不少的学科，如「地图学」、「地理学」、「测绘学」、「遥感技术」等等。根据地图的应用场景，结合这些学科专业，绘制不同的专用地图。
因此，地图创作对大家来说似乎需要有一定的专业要求。而 exping 的诞生始于让每个人可以轻松、容易地呈现自己的品味地图。地图就像一幅画的画布，一个另类的创作载体。（欢迎看看小编写的文章《emoji + 地图 &#x3D; exping》）在此之上以标记「点」，绘制「路线」，表达基于地理位置上的故事。「地图」作为重要的画布，重点在于可塑性，如何帮助创作者对地点进行多样性的表达。那或许一般的地图不足以满足这些需求，借此，这次我们和设计师聊聊，exping 专属地图的一些设计心路历程。
 

作为 exping 的设计师，你怎么理解 exping？
当大家还在以图文的方式分享一个好地方的时候，exping 开始将地图作为主视角。 Explorer 可以方便快捷地添加去过、计划要去的地方以及设计路线，简单或隆重地补充对该地点的评价，上传相关照片。
通过这种更直接的方式，将你的数据传递给你的观众，大幅度减少了“这是哪里？”，“我也想去”，“环境怎么样？”等问答游戏。
在这之前，exping 的地图风格是怎样的？

                              <span>阅读初衷
平时一无聊下来，偶尔会通过消费购物，来提起自己的生活兴致，买东西从挑选，到想象自身使用场景，再到下单盼望着快递，最后拆封这个过程，能在很长一段日子里给自己提供着生活的兴致。而有些时候，反省下觉得单纯是无聊想买买买，而不是使用需求强烈促使我去购物。自觉这种动机是不健康的，同时也很好奇为什么有这种心理，于是便在网络推荐下接触到了这本书——《超市里的原始人》，想借此机会，弄清楚什么是消费主义，对我这种自以为不健康的消费行为如何解剖。
从看到书名中的「原始人」开始，我就期待着书中内容将追根到底消费的欲望最原始的动机是什么。首先需要引用一下在生物学中对人作为社会性灵长类动物特点的描述：

人类在进化过程中形成了许多小范围的社会集体，身在其中，你的形象和地位就是至关重要的，这已经不仅仅是为了满足生存的需求，还是为了吸引伴侣、娱乐朋友和抚育后代。

消费这件事情之所以扯到这么遥远和深层的角度呢，是因为作者主张需要从进化心理学的角度才能透彻地了解消费主义的根源，消费者虽然会半自觉地设法炫耀出财富、地位和品味，但真正想要展现的是更深层次的心理特质（比如善良、智慧和创意）和生理特质（比如生育能力、强壮、美貌）。
《超市里的原始人》中的三个关键论点：

人试图展示自身特质的本能与消费主义关系紧密。
我们用于识别关键人类特质和情感的社交感知系统经过漫长的进化历程变得准确高效，能将所有能收集到的不同暗示聚集起来，察觉出一个人的身体、脸部、语言和行为。
消费主义在很大程度上就是一种画蛇添足的行为。我们得到了有惊人适应力的人类自我展示的能力，即语言、智慧、善良、创造力和美丽，然后却忘记了如何用它们来结交朋友、吸引配偶和获取声望。相反，我们却依赖通过教育、工作、消费获得的商品 和服务来向他人展示自己的个人特质。这些高成本信号大都是多余的或是误导性的， 所以别人通常都会对其视而不见。

                              <span>你用过人工智能写作工具吗？前两个月，我看到了一些AI写作工具推出了文章续写功能。

只要你写上一篇文章的开头和结尾，智能系统就能自动生成一篇完整的文章。虽然现在技术还不成熟，积累的样本数据还不够完善，写出的内容还是会被挑剔，但是我总感觉排布好内容逻辑是迟早的事情。
在那个时候，AI就能代替我们写作吗？
作为内容创作者，我们还有活路吗？现在能帮人进行AI写作的工具有很多，从媒体报道、工作汇报这些角度看，人工智能会逐步替代人工写作。它只追求客观报道和逻辑推导，但无法完成偏主观价值判断的内容生产，因为AI不能代替的是我们对内容的「审美」。
人工智能与审美
前段时间AI绘画掀起了一阵火热，只要输入一些文字和句子，表达画的风格和内容，AI就能自动生产出一副艺术作品。有的画真的能与大神媲美，吊打国内外大部分艺术工作者。但是，这里的问题是，这个作品从「点子」到「作品」之间，完全忽略了过程。
怎么判断一个作品已经做到最好了？还能不能更好？这一笔触能不能再调一调？那一个色块能不能再深一些？如果单独抠几个细节，那是调整，如果从头开始就抠细节，那就是「创作」。
AI写作能根据你前面写的一个词、一段话，自动生成出后面的句子和篇章，但是它对于一个真正想表达的人来说，生产出的段落总会让人差强人意，甚至因为一个字的误用就导致表达结果与表达目的南辕北辙。
说到底，AI写作只能成为我们的工具，是基于创作者的审美的工具。倘若作者的审美和沉淀不够，反而会出现被工具主导，甚至被代替的困境。如同普通人去使用AI绘画一样，对绘画细节失控，除了标题能自己把控，后面的笔触、构图、用色等细节都和自己无关。如果我们本身就懂绘画，那么还可以去微调，但当我们什么都不懂的时候，剩下的只有无尽的赞叹。通过AI生产出了一个远超自己能力范畴的作品，或者说，它远远超出了我们对作品的审美极限。所以，无法对它进行细节的判定。
就如同我们在写作…</span>

                              <span>与其说双链是笔记软件，不如说他们是知识管理软件或思维工具。而这个认知上的错位便是导致目前双链饱受争议的原因之一。

双链是个伪概念？
双链笔记软件目前的争议不少，大家对其的批判也非常实际，可谓是针针见血：

双链的底层逻辑尚未普及，用户无所适从。链接有什么用？哪些应该链接？
notion、语雀、印象笔记都能一定程度上双向链接各种文章。虽然稍微简化了一些，但好像也能用啊。
界面太“硬核”了，不优雅，不美观，基本没有办法给别人看。
没有办法共享和协作。
导出十分麻烦，有时候还要靠插件。
各种命令、快捷键、插件，学习成本高。
代码程度较高，没有代码基础的人被劝退。
知识图谱功能基本只是用来装逼，东西一多基本没法看。

可以发现，当我们以“笔记软件”的角度来看待双链，它和目前各种成熟的笔记软件相比差太多了。看着甚至像尚未完成就拿出来给人用的Alpha版本软件，非常粗糙，体验极差。
但是，如果我们换一个视角，以“知识管理软件”和“思维工具”的角度来看待双链，结果可能会完全不同。而我认为这才是双链的核心优势。
双链的核心优势——知识管理和思维辅助工具
1、信息颗粒度更细，便于细化和延展
个人认为，信息粒度是双链笔记最核心的优势。比起印象笔记以&quot;篇&quot;为单位、notion以“块”为单位，双链笔记是以“点”为单位。这就以为着，我们可以将大块的知识细化为一个个相对独立的知识点。同时，在细化的过程中，我们逐渐把各个知识点从原有的语境中解放（抽象）出来，进而形成能够在长时间的考验下保留下来的知识。这样，当日后遇到新的情景的时候，我们也能迅速知识结构，以支持新的目标。

具体而言，以roam research为例，在使用过程中，你任何时候都可以用 [[]] 来关联另一个概念或者页面，或用 (()) 来关联一个句子或一个块。
2、记录成本低
大部分双链笔记都是基于大纲笔记的，即整体的框架类似于bull…</span>

                              <span>在正式开始说体验前，先谈谈索尼在 9 月初正式发布的全新真·小屏旗舰——Xperia 5 IV，在设计上融合了 Xperia 1 系列的特点，总算是更换了硬朗的边框以及磨砂质感的后盖玻璃，可以说完全契合个人的审美爱好，更不用说破天荒加入了无线充电，我对 Xperia 5 III 最不满意的两点都解决了，还有什么理由不买呢？加上最近在各种视频网站看到关于 Xperia 1 IV、5 III 等机器的吐槽，于是就想在 5 IV 到手前，和大家分享一下我的使用体验。
为何购买 Xperia 5 III
说起来在今年入手 5 III 之前，我在用的是三星 Galaxy S22 Ultra，S22U 真的什么都好，拍照、系统啥的我都挺满意，而且外观更是延续了曾经最爱的 Xperia XZ Premium 的神韵，当时一发售就冲了。只是在实际使用时，总会觉得这机器实在是太大了，单手用太累，可我又不像当年用黑莓 Passport 那样充满喜爱，对其体积无下限容忍，于是乎就又考虑换台趁手的小屏旗舰机器。
然后说起现在的小屏机器，基本上没得选，iPhone 就只有 SE 和 12、13 mini，Android 这边能看上眼的就是魅族 18、Galaxy S22 和 Xperia 5 III。综合来看，12、13 mini 因为刘海直接 pass，SE 电量实在担忧，魅族 18 不防水也 pass，只能让 5 III PK S22。作为一个曾经的 Xperia 5 用户，对于 5 III 可以说是完全不担心，唯一的问题就是臭名昭著的火龙 888，但 S22 用的是 8 Gen1，这对卧龙凤雏就随便吧，毕竟我都能接受 S22U 的 8 Gen1 了。最后特意跑去三星官方店实际上手体验 S22 的感觉，由于 S22 70.6mm 的宽度握持时有点撑手不舒服，于是乎 68mm 宽度的 Xperia…</span>
