Congress has officially passed the Inflation Reduction Act after a successful House vote on Friday, clearing the way for the biggest clean energy package in US history. President Joe Biden is expected to sign the bill into law soon, bringing the US within eyeshot of reaching its climate goals under the Paris accord.
The bulk of the bill’s spending — $369 billion — goes toward building up domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles and clean energy technologies plus making homes and buildings more energy-efficient. There’s another $4 billion to promote drought resiliency in the western US. Outside of climate initiatives, the bill also spends $64 billion on healthcare subsidies to prevent insurance premiums from rising for people who buy...

The future looks bright for those who are looking to nab a great TV at a substantial discount. Many manufacturers — including LG and Samsung — announced new versions of some of their most popular models earlier this year, ranging from The Frame and LG’s C2 lineup to Sony’s QD-OLED models. And now that manufacturers like Samsung and LG have officially launched their new TVs, we’re noticing prices falling on the last-gen, 2021 models. In some cases, we’re even beginning to see discounts on the newer 2022 models, including the aforementioned C2.
Right now, there are currently a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, size configurations, and feature sets. Whether you want a secondary TV for the bedroom...

Telegram released a new update on Frida,y just one day after Telegram CEO and founder Pavel Durov said the update had been in Apple’s app review for two weeks without explanation. The update is packed with emoji-related features, but one is missing because Apple specifically requested its removal, according to Durov.
“After extensive media coverage of my previous post, Apple got back to us with a demand to water down our pending Telegram update by removing Telemoji — higher quality vector-animated versions of the standard emoji,” Durov wrote on his Telegram channel on Friday. “This is a puzzling move on Apple’s behalf, because Telemoji would have brought an entire new dimension to its static low-resolution emoji and would have...

“We’ve been listening to all of your feedback and know that many of you–especially those who are immunocompromised and the people who support them–want stricter health measures in place to help you feel safe attending TwitchCon San Diego in person,” reads the beginning of a major update to the company’s blog post announcing that tickets were on sale.

A security researcher has found a way that an attacker could leverage the macOS version of Zoom to gain access over the entire operating system.
Details of the exploit were released in a presentation given by Mac security specialist Patrick Wardle at the Def Con hacking conference in Las Vegas on Friday. Some of the bugs involved have already been fixed by Zoom, but the researcher also presented one unpatched vulnerability that still affects systems now.
The exploit works by targeting the installer for the Zoom application, which needs to run with special user permissions in order to install or remove the main Zoom application from a computer. Though the installer requires a user to enter their password on first adding the application to...

Peloton CEO Barry McCarthy had his job cut out for him when he took over the helm in February as the company laid off 2,800 employees. Now, roughly six months later, McCarthy has sent out a memo to staffers warning the company plans to eliminate an additional 784 jobs in a third round of layoffs, reports Bloomberg. Peloton will also increase the prices of the Bike Plus and Tread, while shuttering retail showrooms starting in 2023.
Peloton spokesperson Ben Boyd confirmed the news in a statement to The Verge, writing:
 “Peloton, today, took several steps to further advance our transformation strategy, better positioning the company for long term success as the largest, global Connected Fitness company. The moves we made include, the...

In a video game climate that bends over backwards to assure you the cute little creatures you play as or with cannot be harmed, it was shocking to hear the mother fox’s neck snap in Endling - Extinction is Forever. I was running with my trio of kits, trying to escape the murderous clutches of a furrier when he caught me. I struggled as he held me down before I heard the crack of the bones as the screen went dark, informing me I had failed as a mother and that my cubs were going to die. And while I thought that was a little too much, that kind of unflinching look at the reality of survival in a world ruined by climate change is exactly what the developers were going for.

                              <span>V2V, or vehicle-to-vehicle technology, allows cars to receive messages about road conditions and crashes.
    

  
Today, the DC circuit court released its decision, siding with the Federal Communications Commission, on its reallocation of part of the 5.9GHz band. It’s a big win for the FCC and a big loss for the auto industry, which has promised to use the airwaves to improve safety through a technology called “vehicle-to-vehicle” (V2V) or “vehicle-to-everything” (V2X) communication. 
The problem, as hilariously put by Judge Justin Walker in his opinion, is that this technology has never really existed. It was one of those “just around the corner”-type innovations that has always been promised but never actually delivered. It was a fantasy, and today, the court’s basically said as much.

So you’re the proud owner of one of Samsung’s foldables. Look at you, you early adopter! There are obviously a few more ways to use your phone than a typical slab-style phone, and that’s probably why you bought one. 
Flex Mode is one of those features. That’s basically just a term for whenever you use the phone’s main screen folded halfway. It’s most useful if you want to set the phone down and use it hands-free, like for video calls, and some apps are optimized by default to take advantage of it. 
Here’s how to use Flex Mode with the apps that support it natively — and also how to enable it for apps that don’t. I tested these steps on a Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Galaxy Z Flip 4 running One UI 4.1.1.

Get ready for your shortest walk-through of an Ikea store yet because Electrify America is bringing its fast charging EV network to more than 25 Ikea locations in the US (via Electrek).
The plan includes installing more than 220 individual fast chargers capable of charging up to 350kW speeds at Ikea stores in 18 different states. The first public chargers will make an appearance by the end of the year and the rest by the end of 2023.
“This collaboration with Electrify America will not only bring ultra-fast public chargers to our stores for the first time but it will also help us take a big leap as we work towards our targets to become circular and climate positive,” said Ikea US CEO Javier Quiñones. Ikea set that climate goal for 2030,...

                              <span>Technology stacks like LAMP, MEAN, and MERN have been a boon to developer productivity. With just four components you have everything you need to develop web applications quickly and easily. And while these stacks do provide a robust framework out of the box, they are not without complexity, and aren’t always designed to scale. As a result, organizations often find themselves transitioning away from their V1 application built in a four part stack to a simpler configuration. Reducing complexity is a great way to improve stability, which, in turn, is a great way to reduce costs.
Here at HarperDB, we refer to this process of simplification as Collapsing The Stack. Fewer moving parts means less can go wrong, after all. In this article, we’ll outline challenges with the four-part stack and prop…</span>

                              <span>Vercel and Netlify make it easy for developers to build and ship full-stack serverless applications. Both platforms provide features such as serverless edge functions, CDN (content delivery network), build tools, analytics, etc. While building full-stack applications on these platforms, developers have quite a few options for their data layer (database). This article compares the databases commonly used with Vercel and Netlify, so you can make an informed decision when picking a new database for your project.
PlanetScale is an easy to use MySQL-compatible serverless database. MySQL is easy to get up and running. However, you have to scale up your MySQL instances as your database grows. Database sharding is a common technique that is used to scale MySQL.

i am going to use React obviously and probably NextJs , for the backend normal NodeJS, now here it comes the problem, database, i have no idea of what type of database (postgres,mysql...) or service ( aws, azure... ) To use, RIP. Can someone help me? i know this is going to be hard, that&#x27;s why i am going to make it first as a personal object and later if it works as intented and with no bugs... i would scale it to a Saas and offer it at a price!
Soooooo, can someone help me on choosing the stack in terms of storaging users and their information, + the actual post scheduler (this one i quite know what to do already, my problem would be more of how to handle the upload/save the videos to my database and make the script know which ones to post ( i know on this case i can do &quot; NodeJS calls the database every minute to retrieve all the videos that need to be sent out that minute. &quot; ))
I&#x27;ve seen a user use Fauna as a database for twitter scheduling, and another one (owner of feedhive.io) use AWS Amplify. I don&#x27;t really know what to do in this part!
So can you help me, kek?!</span>

                              <span>Introduction


I find automating tasks one of the coolest things about programming. Lately, I&#x27;ve been thinking about ways to utilize APIs to automatize some things, and I came up with the idea of making my Twitter profile banner image change automatically from time to time. It would be like having access to a Twitter feature that no one has, the capability of having a slideshow as a banner instead of a single image.
I will use NASA&#x27;s Astronomy Picture of the Day API to obtain the images I will use. This API provides a different image daily, making it appropriate for this specific purpose. Also, by using this API, I know that my Twitter banner will repeat no pictures. You can use images from other APIs or your own.
Before starting, you&#x27;ll need access to the Twitter API and the NASA API.

                              <span>What Is the Difference Between Coding and Programming?
Coding has to do with the computer&#x27;s syntax, whereas programming has to do with the thought process of the program.
Why is this distinction important? Because employers hire programmers!
In this article, we cover the difference between coding and programming and why employers hire programmers, not coders!
Coding has to do with the computer language&#x27;s syntax.
Ok, so what exactly is “syntax?” 🤔
Wikipedia defines syntax as “the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured statements or expressions in that language.”
Keywords such as let and function, the &#x3D; sign, quotes, and bracket symbols all represent the computer language&#x27;s syntax.

In simpler terms, coding is the process of &quot;spe…</span>

The absolute best, bleeding edge best of the best of the best humanity is capable of will make your wallet bleed significantly, and to be honest it&#x27;s often not even worth it except for very few use cases. 
But that&#x27;s no excuse to doing things completely wrong either! There is an acceptable middle point, where you invest a little to get a lot. In this article I&#x27;m going to show you a few things you can do in your AWS solution to improve your Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Security, Operational Excellence or Cost Optimization, or perhaps more than one of those. They&#x27;re not hard and they&#x27;re not expensive. You&#x27;ll spend very little time and money, and get a big impact out of this. They&#x27;re low-…</span>

Cloud-to-cloud integration required OAuth2 server for linking your smart device service to Google Home application. In this article, we will implement it with Laravel framework and Passport package. You should pass base steps, like Laravel and Passport installation, database setup, and make fake users or you can find example code here. All additional actions will be described next.

A DBA (Database Administrator) is the professional responsible for the creation, installation, monitoring, repair and analysis of the database architecture. They have the responsibility of analysing the banks periodically so that there are no overloads in the system, and also to check that the destination of the servers is correct, according to the company&#x27;s standardisation and good development practices.

                              <span>使用两个 ls 程序： lsd 和 exa 来重新想象和设计你的文件和目录列表。




Linux 中的 ls 命令是最常用的命令。此命令列出终端中的文件和目录。因此，如你所见，它非常流行，也许每个人都在使用。

但该命令输出的信息量很大，有时用彩色的方式查看它们会更方便。

例如，如果你以最基本的方式运行 ls 命令，它应该看起来有点像这样：



这似乎有点乏味，不是吗？如果你可以对其进行一些样式设置，以便在看起来不错的同时变得更具可读性如何？

以样式列出文件和目录

lsd

我想向你展示的第一个应用叫做 lsd，也就是 “LSDeluxe” 的缩写。它是对 GNU ls 命令的重写，具有列标题、各种项目的颜色、字体和图标支持等附加功能。

这是安装后的样子：

lsd -l --header




正如你所看到的，它看起来非常漂亮，用不同的颜色代码表示权限、文件类型和文件夹，甚至在文件名旁边添加图标。

该应用充满了诸如树视图（见下文）之类的功能，它甚至可以在单个命令中为你提供文件夹内的文件列表：

lsd -l --header --tree




你可以在其 官方 GitHub 页面 上了解有关其功能的更多信息。

我相信你很兴奋。让我们看看如何安装它。

你可以从 此处下载 用于 Ubuntu 和相关发行版的 deb 文件。之后，只需运行 dpkg 即可安装：

sudo dpkg -i lsd_vvvv_amd64.deb


对于 Fedora Linux，使用以下命令:

sudo dnf install lsd


Arch Linux 用户可以使用以下命令获取它：

pacman -S lsd


该应用也可用于其他发行版、macOS、BSD 和 Windows。对于这些说明，你可以 在此处找到它们。

为了获得更好的体验，请将其与 带有 Oh My Zsh 的 Zsh shell 一起使用。

exa

下一个程序是 exa，类似于 lsd 但具有更多功能。exa 命令可以为你的 ls 输出着色，检测 Unix 系统中的各种文件类型、标题、树视图等更多功能。

exa 是一个单一的二进制文件，占用的资源很小。以下是一些示例命令：

exa -al


exa -abghHliS


exa -abghHliS --long --tree




你可以在 GitHub 上了解有关 exa 参数和选项的更多信息。

exa 的安装很简单，只需要一个命令。对于 Ubuntu 和相关发行版，你可以使用以下命令安装它：

sudo apt install exa


对于 Fedora 和 Arch Linux，分别使用以下命令：

sudo dnf install exa


pacman -S exa


同样，所有其他操作系统的安装说明都可以 在此处找到。

从终端复制为 HTML

一个有趣的技巧是，以上所有彩色列表都可以通过默认的 Ubuntu 终端复制为 HTML。你可以将它用于你的网页或文档。

例如，我将上面的示例复制到 LibreOffice Writer 文档中。

这是最好的功能之一，尽管它取决于终端程序而不是上面的程序。



总结

我解释了两个程序的内部工作 – lsd 和 exa 以样式列出文件和目录。我希望你能将它们用于不同的需求。

如果你喜欢它们，或者如果你知道任何此类程序，请在评论栏中告诉我。

英特尔的 Clear Linux 采用 -O3 来构建其内核

英特尔的 Clear Linux 滚动发行版以其积极的性能优化而闻名，但他们的内核构建一直采用默认的 -O2 优化，不过，上周他们切换到了用 -O3 来构建其内核。虽然上游内核已经放弃了专门的 -O3 选项，但更高的优化水平仍然可以通过编译器标志传递给内核，这就是 Clear Linux 正在做的。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：虽然 Clear Linux 采用 -O3 优化提升了多少还不得而知，但对于 Clear Linux 这种要榨取最后一滴性能来炫耀英特尔的 CPU 的发行版来说，显然是有意义的。




谷歌将停止为愚蠢的问题提供答案

“特色片段”是向谷歌搜索提出的问题而直接回复的片段，长期以来一直是该公司人工智能战略的一个基石，同样的技术也用于其智能音箱和语音助手。谷歌试图改进其“特色片段”服务，以停止对愚蠢的问题提供简短的答案。这意味着诸如“史努比什么时候刺杀了林肯？”这样的问题不会得到答案，谷歌搜索曾经给出过回答“1865 年&quot; —— 日期正确，但刺客非常错误。谷歌对其系统进行了训练，以更好地检测这些虚假的问题。

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://linux.cn/article-14921-1.html?utm_source&#x3D;rss&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;rss">

                              <span>开源是一个具有挑战性的概念。许多人认为，开源意味着可以任意的使用软件，并且可以免费下载。这实际上取决于你如何被许可 —— 开发者分享代码时使用的许可证决定了它。开源软件可以是收费的，也可以限制你如何去使用它，在极少数情况下，甚至让你陷入法律纠纷。

Fedora 项目最近决定拒绝所有使用 知识共享Creative Commons “公共领域专用” CC0 许可证的代码，以避免这种情况的出现。CC0 将从新提交代码中准许使用的许可证列表中剔除，但是，像艺术品一类的贡献仍被允许所以它，甚至可能在个案的情况下对当前的软件包进行逐一的处理。

如果 Fedora 反对一个软件许可证，通常不会成为新闻。事实上，在那么多的许可证当中，该项目拒绝了许多许可证。这种情况的意外之处在于，CC0 最初被认为是一个有效的许可证，现在只是由于更大的自由及开源（FOSS）社区内的观点转变而被重新分类。

CC0 是因为什么让 Fedora 决定停止支持它，这又是否意味着你不能在你自己的项目中使用它呢？

这一段描述让最熟悉知识共享及其许可系列的人惊讶的是，Fedora 最初批准了 CC0 的软件。毕竟，知识共享从一开始的目标是为艺术作品提供一系列明确的许可证。该组织的使命和许可证的要求在其名称“知识共享”中就有所体现。

为了“克服分享信息和创造力的法律障碍”，提供一个自由的框架来为人们组织分享如音乐、医学或教育材料的资源，知识共享组织的前身——开放内容项目Open Content Project，于 2001 年成立。然而，软件从来不是它的组成要素。为什么呢？因为那时，如 MIT、GPL 一类的重要的软件许可证已经出现了十几年。

很明显，如果一家公司不遗余力地警告你他们制造的东西不适合某种特定用途，你也许应该相信他们。知识共享的 FAQ 列出了一些反对在软件上使用他们的许可证的令人信服的论据，但对于像 Fedora 项目这样的用户来说，其中一个问题特别突出：专利权。

鉴于 CC0 许可证是为公共领域的作品准备的，而且通过使用它，创作者明确地“放弃了他或她在版权法下对作品的所有权利”，这似乎矛盾的。但是，问题在于，版权法并不适用于专利。事实上，仔细审视许可证的完整措辞后可以发现，它在一个令人担忧的部分解决了这个问题，该部分内容如下：“宣告者拥有的任何商标或专利权都没有被本文本放弃、抛弃、交出、租赁或以其他方式修改。”

换言之，即使被 CC0 许可的东西的作者可能愿意放弃对它的权力，但他们仍然可以自由的为它申请专利。更糟糕的是，他们仍然保留着以他们认为合适的方式使用该专利的能力。

理论上来说，这意味着最初在 CC0 下提供的源代码的人在发布了代码之后，他们可能会在之后断言任何使用该代码的人侵犯了他们的专利，并要求支付专利费。

这显然会让像 Fedora 这样的项目担忧。考虑一下这样的情形：CC0 许可的代码进入到一个系统的核心，然后被提供给数以百万计的用户。突然间，不知道从哪里冒出来的原创作者，声称侵犯了专利权，并要求付款。红帽或 Fedora 的律师可以驳倒这种说法么？也许吧。那么，为了查明真相而使用 CC0 代码值得么？不值得。

要着重提到的是，这完全不是一个新问题。实际上，早在 2012 年，专利条款就阻止了开源倡议（OSI）许可证的审查委员会，他们无法最终确定 CC0 是否真正符合他们对开源许可证的定义。委员会未能达成一致意见，因为其成员认为将此类条款纳入软件许可将创造一个危险的先例。考虑到 Fedora 动荡的历史，它最初接受 CC0 的决定着实让人费解。

本文参与数字文具盒征文活动。

因为去年写了这篇文章分享我的 workflow，所以在这次的征文题目公布时，少数派的编辑也贴心的来问我有没有想分享的工具。说实话，对于这次的征文题目，我是喜忧参半。喜的是，可以期待一波好工具的分享，满足我对工具的探索欲； 忧的是，对工具探索的过度好奇往往会占用额外的时间和精力，反而加剧了我的论文写作拖延症。 相信很多少数派的读者和我一样，对于新的工具总是充满好奇，迫不及待地探索一番后，又往往很快搁置到一边， 真正能用下去的工具，往往还是那几个常用的。
我想其原因可以有以下几个：

一些新的工具，虽然有全新的名字和界面，但是功能往往与已有的工具重合，并不能给工作效率带来实质帮助。
另一些新的工具可能会意识到上述问题，但是开发新的功能毕竟困难，于是转而希望努力改变或者教导用户一套新的方法论或使用逻辑。然而，愿景虽好，但这往往并没有从用户的实际需要出发，反而带来了过高的学习成本。
工具自身的缺陷问题，譬如平台覆盖不足，导入导出不够开放，系统不够稳定，乃至字体不够大等等。
确实有一些好工具提供了实用且简洁的功能，但是介绍中并没有提供实际的应用场景，所以有时不知如何将之纳入自己的工作流中进行合理使用。
个人主观的好恶。

当然，作为一个不懂任何工具开发的文科菜鸟，我自然也没有资格吹毛求疵，对工具大加评判。所以本文，我只想从一个长期用户的实际使用体验出发，分享一些我实际研究学习过程中真正用到的一些工具和使用场景，希望读到本文的你有一点点帮助。

Documentation is an important part of any technical project. Good documentation tells the end user how to run the program, how to use it, or how to compile it. For many projects, plain text documentation is the standard. After all, every system can display plain text files.
However, plain text is limiting. Plain text files lack formatting elements like italics text, bold text, and titles. To add these elements, we can leverage HTML. HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the markup language used in all web browsers. And with a little extra effort, you can use HTML to write project documentation that can be read by everyone.
HTML uses a series of tags enclosed in angle brackets …</span>

I am teaching Python using Raspberry Pi 400 computers in a local library for the second year in a row. A couple of this year&#x27;s students have not experienced success with mathematics in their school. One asked me if she needed algebra to attend our class. I told her I had failed algebra, geometry, and trigonometry in school. She was relieved. Another student rushed in the door a bit late because she was taking geometry in summer school after failing to pass the course during the school year. I shared my own story of learned helplessness and my distress at the thought of math tests. My own bad experiences impacted my high school and early colleg…</span>

🔥 Hi，我是小彭。本文已收录到 GitHub · AndroidFamily 中。这里有 Android 进阶成长知识体系，有志同道合的朋友，关注公众号 [彭旭锐] 带你建立核心竞争力。
前言
Java Reference 类型是与虚拟机垃圾回收机制密切相关的知识点，同时也是面试重要考点之一。 一般认为 Java 有四种 Reference（强引用 &amp; 软引用 &amp; 弱引用 &amp; 虚引用），但是其实还有隐藏的第五种 Reference，你知道是什么吗？
在这篇文章里，我将总结引用类型的用法 &amp; 区别，并基于 ART 虚拟机分析相关源码。如果能帮上忙，请务必点赞加关注，这真的对我非常重要。
提示： 本文源码分析基于 Android 9.0 ART 虚拟机。
这篇文章是 JVM 系列文章第 5 篇，专栏文章列表：
一、内存管理：
1、内存区域划分
2、垃圾回收机制
3、对象创建过程
4、对象内存布局
5、引用类型
6、Finalizer 机制
二、编译链接过程
1、Java 编译过程
2、Class 文件格式
3、注解处理器
4、注解机制
5、类加载机制
6、泛型机制
三、执行系统
1、方法调用与返回
2、重载与重写
3、反射机制
4、异常机制
提示：很多内容都已经发表过了，最近会整理出来
学习路线图：

1. 认识 Java 引用
1.1 Java 四大引用类型
Java 引用是 Java 虚拟机为了实现更加灵活的对象生命周期管理而设计的对象包装类，一共有四种引用类型，分别是强引用、软引用、弱引用和虚引用。我将它们的区别概括为 3 个维度：
维度 1 - 对象可达性状态的区别： 强引用指向的对象是强可达的，而其他引用指向的…</span>

很高兴遇见你~
在本系列的上一篇文章中，我们介绍了 Flutter 开发环境搭建，以及使用 AndroidStudio 运行你的第一个 Flutter 项目，体验了热重载。还没有看过上一篇文章的朋友，建议先去阅读Flutter 系列（一）：运行你的第一个 Flutter 应用，在我看来，Dart 在设计时应该是借鉴了百家语言之所长😄：Java，Kotlin等：
1、在静态语法方面，如：类型定义，方法声明，泛型等，和 Java 非常相似
2、一些语法特性，如：函数式特性，空安全，函数默认值等，和 Kotlin 非常相似
3、Dart 还有一些自己独创的语法，如：命名构造方法，级联操作符等
总之，熟悉之后，你会发现 Dart 是一门非常有意思的编程语言，接下来就让我们一起进入 Dart 的语法学习吧
注意： Dart 语法和 Java，Kotlin 真的很像，尤其是 Java。另外如果对 Kotlin 语法不熟的，可以去看我的另外一篇文章：&quot;Kotlin&quot;系列: 一、Kotlin入门
一、变量和方法
1.1、变量
1）、Dart 可以显示指明类型来声明一个可变的变量。且指明的类型分为可空和非空
2）、Dart 也可以使用 var 关键字来声明一个可变的变量，此时编译器会根据变量初始值自动推断类型
3）、Dart 使用 final 关键字来声明一个不可变的变量，且可以替代 var 或加在类型前面
4）、Dart 中变量如果是非空类型，那么必须给一个默认值，否则无法编译通过。如果是可空类型，默认值都为 null
5）、Dart 中每一行代码都要加 ; 😂，走回头路了，有点鸡肋

0x1、引言
如题，最近两周疲于折腾公司第三方SDK升级，掉坑里一直出不来，前天突发奇想，终于定位到问题原因。

问题很简单，却花费了这么长时间，终究还是我太菜了！

BUG虽然解了，但觉得还是有必要 记录复盘下，以便下次遇到类似问题时，能找到更好的切入点，更快地把问题解决。
问题概述
现在哪个房产类APP不上VR全景图啊，所以我司也整了一个，经纪人录盘时，使用全景相机对盘源进行拍摄，在录盘填信息的同时，把全景图也上传到服务器。而他们录盘的过程是这样的：
使用 全景相机官方APP，连接相机，对盘源进行拍摄，官方APP拼接生成全景图；
拍完打开 公司APP，来到录盘页，填写录盘信息，然后打开手机相册，选择对应的全景图上传；
录一次盘得在两个APP间来回切换，可以是可以，但流程繁琐，效率也低，他们更希望：
直接就在公司APP上就可以完成相机连接、拍摄、拼接和上传。
任务传到客户端这边，所以我们需要：
集成官方SDK，参考官方Demo和文档，根据具体业务进行二次开发。
杰哥徒手封装的Library已经稳定跑了两年：

本以为可以一劳永逸，安享晚年，最近却出了幺蛾子：

有经纪人买了新款相机，然后用公司APP无法拍照。

em...硬件、固件升级，需要更新下SDK，可以理解，那就升吧，正当我以为这次升级，会像当初刚集成时那样 丝滑流畅，却是 磨人踩坑 的开始...

0x2、第一道坎：SDK自带预览组件黑屏
很快新的SDK到位，Library替换上新AAR，API有些变动，跟着Demo改改，算是跑起来了，但问题也来了：
拍摄预览页 → 关闭并跳转新页面 → 再次打开预览页 → 预览组件黑屏
看了下官方Dem…</span>

除了英伟达正忙于向开源 GPU 内核驱动过渡之外，昨天他们还罕见地公开了开源文档：多达 7.3 万行的头文件，记录了他们从十年前的 Fermi 到当前一代 Ampere GPU 的 3D 类。这些头文件对于开源的 Nouveau 驱动程序开发人员来说非常有用，可以节省他们的逆向工程和对某些位的猜测。

LibreOffice 添加龙芯架构支持

继今年早些时候 GCC 12 引入对龙芯架构的支持、Linux 5.19 添加了初步支持，以及 Glibc 2.36 也添加了支持之后，LibreOffice 现在加入到了这一行列。将龙芯架构支持添加到 LibreOffice 需要增加 1630 行新代码，这包括数百行新的 C++ 代码。

                              <span>遵循几个简单的步骤来保持 Git 仓库的整洁


在合并一个 GibLab 的合并请求（MR）或 GitHub 的拉取请求（PR）后，你通常需要从远程仓库中删掉这个主题分支来保持仓库的整洁。然而，这只会删掉远程仓库的主题分支。本地 Git 仓库也会从例行清理中收益。

要同步本地仓库和远程仓库的信息，可以执行 git prune 命令来删除本地仓库中远程分支的本地引用。

按照以下三个简单的步骤：

1、检出仓库中的核心分支（比如 main 或者 master）：

$ git checkout 


2、列出所有远程和本地分支：

$ git branch -a


示例输出：

4.10.z
* master
  remotes/mydata/4.9-stage
  remotes/mydata/4.9.z
  remotes/mydata/test-branch


在这个例子中，test-branch 是从远程仓库中删除的主题分支的名字。

3、删除远程分支的本地引用：

首先，列出所有可以从本地仓库中删除的分支：

$ git remote prune origin --dry-run


示例输出：

Pruning origin
URL: git@example.com:myorg/mydata-4.10.git
* [would prune] origin/test-branch


然后，删除远程分支的本地引用：

$ git remote prune origin


示例输出：

Pruning origin
URL: git@example.com:myorg/mydata-4.10.git
* [pruned] origin/test-branch


就是这样！

维护 Git 仓库

保持 Git 仓库的整洁，一开始似乎并不紧急，但是随着仓库规模的增长，删除不必要的数据就变得更为重要。不要让从无用的数据筛选而拖慢你。

经常删除远程分支的本地引用，是维护一个可用的 Git 仓库是一个好方法。

                              <span>我们经常交替使用人工智能（AI）、机器学习（ML）和深度学习（DL）这些术语，尽管我们几乎每天都阅读或听到它们。本文解释了这些技术是如何演变的以及它们有何不同。




人工智能Artificial Intelligence（AI）、机器学习Machine Learning（ML）和深度学习Deep Learning（DL）通常可以互换使用。但是，它们并不完全相同。人工智能是最广泛的概念，它赋予机器模仿人类行为的能力。机器学习是将人工智能应用到系统或机器中，帮助其自我学习和不断改进。最后，深度学习使用复杂的算法和深度神经网络来重复训练特定的模型或模式。

让我们看看每个术语的演变和历程，以更好地理解人工智能、机器学习和深度学习实际指的是什么。

人工智能

自过去 70 多年以来，人工智能已经取得了长足的进步。无论我们是否知道，也不管喜欢与否，，它已经渗透到了我们生活的方方面面。在过去十年中，机器学习和深度学习的进步已经在各种规模的行业和组织中创造了人工智能热潮。云服务提供商通过开发免费的开源服务和提供新的场景进一步推动的这种势头。



人工智能可能是自 1956 年以来最受关注的概念。到 2015 年，GPU 的广泛使用使并行处理更快、更强大、更便宜。而愈加廉价的存储可以大规模地存储大数据（从纯文本到图像、映射等）。这产生了对数据分析的需求，它被更普遍地称为数据科学data science，导致机器学习发展为实现人工智能的方法。

机器学习

机器学习是使用算法来处理、学习和理解或预测可用数据的模式。最近，软件开发的低代码和无代码概念被用作机器学习中的自学习过程，它给出了完成特定任务的特定指令。通过使用数据和算法对机器进行“训练”，使其能够学习如何执行任务，更重要的是，将学习应用到不断发展的过程中。



机器学习是在开发者社区专注于 AI 时发展起来的，然后发展了算法决策树学习、逻辑编程、聚类、并行处理和强化学习。这些都是朝着正确方向迈出的良好一步，但不足以解决世界感兴趣的场景。

深度学习

深度学习是神经网络和机器学习的进化，是人工智能社区的创意。它学习了人类思维在特定场景中的工作方式，然后在这项工作上比人类做得更好！例如，IBM 的 Watson 与自己下国际象棋，并在游戏中取得了很大进步，最终击败了世界冠军。谷歌的 AlphaGo 也学会了如何玩围棋游戏，一遍又一遍地玩它以提高自己，并成为冠军。

人工智能、机器学习和深度学习正在不断发展。参与数据科学的每个人都希望推进这些概念以改善我们的日常生活。而开源社区、私营企业、科学家和政府机构都在为此共同努力。



总而言之，虽然 AI 有助于创建智能机器，但机器学习有助于构建 AI 驱动的应用。深度学习是机器学习的一个子集。它通过利用复杂算法处理大量数据来训练特定模型。由于狭义 AI 极难开发，机器学习正在通过刚性计算解决这一领域的机遇。至少对于实现通用 AI，深度学习有助于将 AI 和机器学习结合在一起。

                              <span>前言
我是阿杜，目前在开发一款笔记类应用 岁月笔记 。2020 年苹果推出过一个「轻 App (App Clips)」功能，让我们不需要下载安装 也能使用，号称苹果版小程序；
但是时至今日一直被当做APP的阉割版，作为苹果公司推出的系统级小程序,或许有更酷的交互方式；
正好做的APP内有个信件模块，用户写好信件后分享生成图片，这样交互太呆板了，不太友好；可以利用AppClip，把信件写入NFC卡片，让手机靠近NFC，弹出信件卡片！
效果如下👇🏻

原理
其实原理也很简单，就是把信件编辑好写入NFC，然后卡片调起信件；

NFC只要是苹果支持的DNEF数据格式的白卡都可以,某多多上有卖的；
刚开始是这样的
白卡
然后设计图案后，交由厂家打印成卡贴后贴在 NFC 卡片上。

外观
只有一个卡片也不太拿得出手，所以给它设计了一个盒子
外包装

                              <span>万万没想到，时隔多年我又开始用上了QQ。
起因是需要打包一些软件给朋友，发微信超过了200M限制，好不容易传上了网盘，朋友那边的下载速度却只有几十k。我实在没辙了，朋友突然提议说——为何不在QQ传给他？
QQ？
我已经卸载好多年了。这个一路承载了我青春回忆的应用，却在我年龄渐长后变成了不堪回首的过往，转而封锁空间、卸载停用。
只能偶尔在媒体上了解到其主力军已经变成了00后，且功能越来越花里胡哨。最新版本更是因为搭配虚幻4引擎、大小达到800M，而被戏称为腾讯3A大作。
朋友这次提起，我才知道原来QQ传送文件竟没有大小限制，速度也很快，连钉钉都有限制大小，QQ竟这么勇的吗？好奇心驱使我去下载了最新的8.9.3版本来体验，意外发现如今的QQ还真有许多妙用，当然槽点也不少，且听我细细道来。

聊天斗图很过瘾
在微信斗图时是不是常苦恼表情包不够？在QQ这里完全没这种烦恼！
在聊天输入框搜索，就会弹出表情，不用像微信一样单独去搜，搜图贼快！

如果你连表情都懒得搜，QQ还能智能帮你斗图！这在QQ叫“怼图”，即聊天中如果 20 秒内连续出现三次图片即可触发怼图标记，点击一下标记，系统就会根据对方发的表情自动帮你斗图，简直不要太爽。

如果这还不够过瘾，QQ还有招！
长按常规表情包，可以触发弹射功能，届时就能看到满屏幕的表情乱飞，看着就很解压。

可能是觉得表情包停留在视觉动效，还不足以抚平年轻人躁动的心，所以QQ还增加了触感的刺激。选择“戳一戳”好友，不同的动作会让手机产生不同节奏的震动，交互很爽。

如果觉得公共表情不够独特，你也可以自己捏脸换装，生成专属形象的表情包，也十分地酷。

表情方面很多玩法，语音上也放开了限制。
微信语音上限为60秒，而QQ语音可达到120秒，与之配套的还有语音进度条，想拖到哪都行，也支持变音。

This is the second article in a two-part series on energy disruption that could lead to open organization projects. In the first part, based on the book, Clean Disruption of Energy and Transportation, by Tony Seba, I discussed disruption in the use of electric vehicles over internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, the use of self-driving over human-driven vehicles, and the use of solar power generation over nuclear power generation.
In this second part, I will discuss additional potential projects likely to introduce more disruption, specifically the use of solar power generation over other sources. Solar power has advantages over other pr…</span>

I feel confident in claiming that HTML is the most widely used markup language ever. While other markup languages exist, including nroff and groff, LaTeX, and Markdown, no other markup language is as widespread as the Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the de facto language of the Web. First implemented in web browsers in 1994, the language continues to evolve. Yet the basics of HTML remain the same.
If you are just getting started in HTML, I wanted to offer this gentle introduction to learning HTML. I focus on the essentials of HTML to build a basic understanding of how HTML works. You can use this as a starting point to learn more about HTML.

                              <span>之前我分享过2T容量的M.2 SSD固态硬盘，其标称速度达到了7400MB/s。由于其发烧级别的价格，让许多小伙伴都无法接受。其实当时我也在想，难道就不能降一个规格吗？比如用5000MB/s的SSD固盘，难道PS5主机会真的无法识别？还是说速度上会有较大的影响呢。
这次我从朋友那入了一条大华的C970 SSD固态硬盘，本来是装机用的，现在先拿来测试一下在PS5主机内的情况，希望能解开各位小伙伴的疑问。

关于主机的空间拓展

PS5主机内部大概是825GB的存储空间，实际可用约为677.2GB容量。以现今PS5游戏的容量来说，随便安装10个游戏都满了，特别是开了第二档会员后。幸好PS5提供了内置M.2 SSD扩充槽，可以增加主机的存储容量。

对于M.2 SSD的规格是否有要求？

翻阅官方说明可以看到，PS5的内置M.2 SSD的规格需要M插槽类型，长度支持2230、2242、2260、2280、22110，单面或者双面M.2 SSD均可，存储大小在250GB至4TB，建议连续读取速度达5500MB/s或更高。换句话说，就是推荐采用PCIe Gen4.0x4传输模式，速度能达到5500MB/s以上，容量4TB以下的SSD固态硬盘 。

出于对热散的需求，PlayStation 5也支持带有M.2 SSD散热“马甲”的固态硬盘安装，只不过整体厚度不能超过11.25mm。

那么是不是速度达到5500MB/s以上的M2.SSD就可以了呢？在此官方特意作出了说明。“不能保证所有符合所述规格的 M.2 SSD设备都能与您的主机配合使用，并且不对第三方产品的选择、性能或使用承担任何责任。”因此建议在选购前，先关注各个厂家的官方介绍，或者看一下用户实际体验，是否支持PS5主机。

这次咱们就用大华C970 1TB SSD固态硬盘（以下简称大华C970 SSD固态硬盘）来测试一下，究竟…</span>

最近我写东西时遇到了一些阻碍。这些问题可能你也遇到过。

想写的内容已经有人写过了，没有写的动力了，怎么办？
总觉得自己的想法和经历不值得分享出来，去浪费别人的时间。
花了时间和精力写出来了，但阅读量和反馈都很一般，信心因此被打击。

总结下来就是，我想写的，别人已经写过了；我不想写的，写着也没意思；想写的，写不清楚，别人看不懂。完了，不想写作了。
这些问题都会有一个共性矛盾，就是我带入了「别人」这个角色。「别人」已经看过的，「别人」可能不喜欢，担心浪费「别人」的时间。我们去担心「别人」，然后把不想写作的问题归咎在对自己的不自信。
但这只是一种托辞。
其实，我们创作欲的敌人不是「不自信」，而是对「面向自己写作」与「面向读者写作」这两个概念的混淆——该面向自己写的时候，念着别人；该面向别人去写的时候，觉得应该坚持自己。

面向自己写作：为了自己的求知欲、表达欲而写；
面向读者写作：为了解决读者的需求，写读者关心的内容。

是为自己写，还是为读者写？之前的我总是在这天平的两端来回摇摆。
一、我的写作经历
1.1 面向读者写作
最早启发我「写作方法」的是罗辑思维和得到，他们以「通过知识服务，为用户节约时间」的理念打磨内容，当时作为用户，我觉得这样的内容特别受用。而这种以服务的姿态来交付内容的理念，一直影响着我的写作。当时的我，觉得做内容其实就是把别人的知识，用清晰的结构（故事引入-结论先行-展开论证-结尾升华）加上简单易懂的大白话来呈现给读者就行。
我也用类似的思路对接老板的朋友打磨短内容，制作课程，写知识干货的文章，组建内容小组…</span>

                              <span>如果你持续关注这几年的新播客，不难发现几乎每周都会有品牌开设播客的动态。去年，我们还在探讨品牌播客能否成为品牌传播矩阵的标配，但如今不断增长的品牌播客已经在用事实说明，该探讨的不再只是「为什么品牌要做播客？」，还应该包括「如何做好品牌播客？」通过这几年积累的案例，我们从播放数据、节目形态等方面进行提炼，给出这份品牌播客避坑指南。
 不断扩张的品牌播客队伍   

创立播客的国内品牌主要由两部分组成：一部分是新消费品牌，一部分是各行各业的头部企业。拥有较为充足的市场预算，对于传播媒介非常敏感，拥有持续内容创作的资源，最重要的是都有建立品牌形象的需求。

在广告预算大幅缩减的环境下，许多大公司都在今年陆续进场，比如特斯拉、仲量联行、摩登天空等，都在近期开设了品牌播客。一些早期入局的品牌还在持续投入，Withinlink碚曦投资协作体出品的「贝望录」、GGV纪源资本的「创业内幕」都已规律更新超过三年。
部分2022年开播的品牌播客
经过对于近三年品牌播客的梳理，不难发现创立播客的国内品牌主要由两部分组成：一部分是新消费品牌，一部分是各行各业的头部企业。拥有较为充足的市场预算，对于传播媒介非常敏感，拥有持续内容创作的资源，最重要的是都有建立品牌形象的需求。
品牌播客成为近期的内容趋势，有三个很重要的原因：
播客市场认知不断提升，走出隐秘的角落。这点从微信指数上不难看出，去年7月31日指数为41万，今年同比翻了一倍，今年7月6日甚至猛增到了1222万。这背后可能是TME、Spotify在播客领域的持续布局，越来越多的名人大咖入场，但无论原因是什么，播客都在走进越来越多人的视野，成为不能忽视的媒介。
品牌播客也有盈利空间，并非纯投入。品牌播客也可以为其他品牌打广告，乍一听并不是件可行的事，但实际已经在发生。因为想要让受众听完一期节目，首先不能一听就是广告宣传，这样很容易劝退，内容必须足…</span>

前言
昨天，看到飞书团队一篇技术分享 《如何解决前端常见的竞态问题》 ，自己的项目中也存在类似的问题，也是容易出 Bug的地方。字节这篇文章是从 Web 端的视角切入的，借鉴意义有限，这篇文章我们从 Android 的视角展开讨论。
其实，异步竞态问题并不是一个难题，但是本着精益求精的态度，对问题做一次全面分析，再思考有哪些解决方案，哪些是最优最适合的方案，对自己和社区都会有帮助。本文示例程序已上传到 Github：DemoHall · RaceRequestDemo，有用请给 Star，谢谢。
学习路线图：

1. 什么是竞态问题
1.1 问题定义
简单来说， 竞态问题就是用户短时间内重复地触发同一个动作产生多个异步请求，而由于请求的响应时延是不稳定的，可能会出现早发起的请求反而比晚发起的请求慢响应的情况，导致界面呈现效果出现混乱、重复、覆盖等异常。
为了帮助你理解问题，以下列举出更多常见的竞态场景：
1、搜索关联词： 在搜索输入栏中，随着用户输入显示对应的关联词，竞态问题可能会展示旧的搜索词的关联词；
2、类型切换： 在列表流中，点击不同的类型选项展示对应类型的数据，竞态问题可能会展示旧类型数据，或重复展现多个状态的数据；
3、下拉刷新： 在加载分页数据的同时下拉刷新，竞态问题可能会导致刷新后展示旧的分页数据，而不是最新的数据。
1.2 问题分解
我们试着对竞态问题进行拆解，梳理出竞态问题的必要条件：

Here at Opensource.com, we thought it would be interesting to survey some of our authors to get a feel for what tools they feel are antiquated (but perhaps still useful!) and what they think of the replacement utilities. What follows is a series of responses and a bit of fun, too.
We sent out the following prompt:
Have you discovered some of your favorite tools have become outdated or deprecated? Or maybe you just switched it up for something new?
What do you use now? Tell us a little about how you feel it is helpful to have made the switch.

The LaTeX document preparation system has an interesting history. When programmer Don Knuth wrote his first book, The Art of Computer Programming, in 1968, it was produced using an old-style printing press method. When he published the second edition in 1976, the publisher had moved to modern phototypesetting.
Knuth was unhappy with how the new edition looked. Addressing the problem from a programmer&#x27;s perspective, Knuth decided to create his own text processing system so his future books could be formatted to look the same way, for every book in the series. And so it was that Don Knuth wrote the first version of TeX in 1978.
A few years later, Leslie Lamport created a set of macro…</span>

美国联邦巡回上诉法庭上周裁决，专利发明人必须是人类。专利法中的术语“个人”指的是人类，因此 AI 不能申请作为专利发明人。这一裁决与澳大利亚、欧盟和英国法院的裁决相同。除非美国最高法院介入此类专利案件，联邦巡回上诉法庭的判决就是终判了。律师表态计划上诉到最高法院，认为上诉法庭对专利法采用了过于狭窄的定义，排除 AI 的发明将会产生负面影响。

英特尔“坚不可摧”的 SGX 再次被攻破

SGX 旨在为加密密钥和其他敏感数据的安全保管提供某种堡垒，即使操作系统或运行在上面的虚拟机被恶意破坏。SGX 的安全性和真实性保证的关键是它创建了所谓的“飞地”，即安全内存块。“飞地”的内容在离开处理器之前就被加密并写入内存中。它们只有在返回后才会被解密。SGX 是许多公司向用户提供安全保证的基石。例如，Signal 用于处理联系人发现的服务器，依靠 SGX 来确保该过程是匿名的。但英特尔最新一代的 CPU 被发现包含一个漏洞，允许攻击者获得加密密钥和其他由该公司的软件防护扩展保护的机密信息。

                              <span>使用位字段和掩码是不用数据结构组合数据的常用方法。




假设你在用 C 语言写一个国际象棋游戏。追踪棋盘上棋子的一种方法是定义一个结构，该结构定义了棋盘上每个可能的棋子及其颜色，因此每个格子都包含该结构中的一个元素。例如，你可以将结构定义成下面这样：

struct chess_pc {
   int piece;
   int is_black;
}


有了这个数据结构，你的程序就会知道每个格子里是什么棋子及棋子的颜色。你可以快速识别出棋子是兵、车、马、象、后还是王，以及棋子是黑还是白。但是，有一种更直接的方法来跟踪这些信息，同时只用更少的数据和内存。与为棋盘上的每个方格存储两个 int 值的结构不同，我们可以存储单个 int 值，并使用二进制位字段和掩码来标识每个方格中的棋子和颜色。

比特和二进制

当使用位字段表示数据时，我们最好像计算机一样思考。让我们从列出可能的棋子开始，并为每个棋子分配一个数字。让我们进入下一个步骤，用二进制表示这个数字，也就是按照计算机追踪它的方式。记住，二进制数是由比特组成的，比特要么是 0，要么是 1。


00000000: 空（0）

00000001: 兵（1）

00000010: 车（2）

00000011: 马（3）

00000100: 象（4）

00000101: 后（5）

00000110: 王（6）


要列出一个棋盘上的所有棋子，我们只需要三个比特从右到左依次代表值 1、2 和 4。例如，数字 6 是二进制的 110。6 的二进制表示中的其他所有位都是 0。

一个聪明一点的方法：我们可以使用那些额外的总是为零的比特来跟踪一个棋子是黑还是白。我们可以使用数字 8（二进制 00001000）来表示棋子是否为黑色。如果这一位是 1，则代表该棋子是黑色；如果是 0，则…</span>

交换机Switch、集线器Hub，还有以太网分离器Ethernet Splitter 是用来帮助扩展网络的网络设备。这其中，最基础的设备就是小巧的以太网分离器了。它们是一种小型设备，可以将一个以太网信号分成两个。它们简单易用，并且还便宜。这可以算是最简单的网络设备之一了，因为它们不需要提供电源，也没有特定的按键或者 LED 灯来提示状态。只是在一个小设备上有三个以太网端口，其中两个在一侧，另一个在另一侧。有些品种是在一侧有带着一小段 RJ45 接口的网线，另一侧是两个以太网端口。

尽管在网络世界中，分离器已经存在了相当长一段时间了，很多人还是不知道如何有效使用它们。与普遍的看法相反的是，以太网分离器应该总是成对购买。直接把分离器的一端和路由器连接，再把两个设备与分离器的两个端口连接，这样是不行的。想让分离器在网络中正常工作，是有一个正确的设置技巧的。

如何使用以太网分离器进行一个基本的设置

要让不同房间的两个设备连接到主信号源，以太网分离器是非常方便的。大多数情况下，它们可以节约网线、墙上的网络插座，并提供了可靠的连接。就像之前说的，以太网分离器是成对出售的。一个分离器将来自设备（通常是路由器）上的信号合并，然后另一个把信号分成两个信道，这样就可以让两个设备通信了。

路由器在房间 A，两个 PC 在房间 B，但是每个房间的墙上只有一个以太网插座。这种情况下，就需要一个分离器，两条网线连到路由器上，网线的另外一端连到分离器上，然后分离器的另一端连到房间 A 墙上的接口。这样路由器的两个信号就合并到一起了。接下来，另一个分离器只有一个端口的那一端接到房间 B 墙上的接口上。从房间 A 合并的信号现在就会分成两个，这样在房间 B 里面，你就可以有两个以太网端…</span>

为什么要使用Hilt依赖注入
之前有写过一些文章 Hilt与Koin的对比，和 Android开发中Hilt的常用场景。看起来是非常简单与实用了，但是会引起一些同学的疑问？
为什么要使用依赖注入？直接new对象不香吗？为什么要把简单的问题复杂化？
你是不是在炫技,是不是像装13？
这还真不是，如果说我使用的Dagger2，还真是炫技，NB啊。Dagger的坑也是真的多，能在大项目中把Dagger用好，那还真是牛，但是我们现在都用Hilt了有什么可装的，使用是真的简单，都是一些场景化的东西，一些固定用法。没必要没必要。
回归正题，为什么要使用依赖注入？哪种情况下推荐使用依赖注入？就算要用依赖注入，为什么依赖注入推荐使用Hilt？
一、自动管理（灵活与解耦）
首先不是说大家写项目就一定要使用依赖注入，如果大家的项目不是大项目，总共就5、6个，10多个页面，你没必要上依赖注入框架，如果是大项目，分模块，分组件，多人协同开发的，并且可能依赖的对象很复杂，或者说套娃似的对象依赖，那么使用Hilt就非常方便。不同模块/组件的开发人员直接在他自己的组件/模块下定义好对象的提供方式，另一边直接用即可，无需关系依赖的复杂度，和实现的逻辑。
我们先看看一些复杂的嵌套依赖，比如我们来一个三层套娃的依赖：

    fun testUser() {
        YYLogUtils.w(userDao.printUser())

缘起：从初尝到热爱，聊聊我为何享受这项运动？
我最开始接触到定向运动（orienteering）是在大学本科期间， 当时在选课系统查找体育课时，发现一门之前没有听过的课程，叫做「定向运动」，出于好奇我便选了这门课。 可能是我平时上课比较认真，加之期末考试时取得了不错的成绩，课程老师邀请我加入学校的定向运动队（我才知道学校还有专门的校队）。
因为定向运动多为户外举行，在训练的时候，我们常集体去到曾举行过定向赛事的山林、公园等，使用地图和指北针进行实地定向，我也因此得以打卡了广东不少胜地，例如深井古村、小洲村、黄山鲁、大夫山、赤水村等等。

对这项运动接触越久，我越喜欢这项运动。虽然它对脑力和体力的要求都较高，且因为经常翻山越岭而面临着受伤的风险，但也正是因为它的刺激和富有挑战性，才令我享受其中。 至于我为什么喜欢它，主要是有以下两点：
同时挑战脑力与体力：有人曾把定向运动生动地比喻成「寻宝游戏」，因为这项运动不仅仅是要依靠体力，也很考验脑力。 我们需要在有限的时间内，通过地图和指北针迅速定位到点标的位置，并快速移动完成「打点」，这就要求我们需要具备良好的识图和定位能力。刚开始训练的时候，我时常会迷路， 哪怕手里拿着地图和指北针，跑着跑着就不知道自己身处位置了。

翻山越岭：对于很喜欢户外运动的我来说， 定向运动为我提供了深入不同场景的机会，像我以往参加的赛事中，有些是在山里面举行，有些是在街道众多的小镇里面举行。场景不同，体验也富有差异。相比于其他有固定场景的运动，定向运动更符合我的喜好（虽然它也因为需要前往不同场景，而没那么便利）…</span>

                              <span>2020年的两个小故事
少数派对于我的”播客创作“而言，有很特殊的意义。2020年我为了完成自己的本科毕业论文《场景时代播客特点的新思考——播客伴随性与情感性的相关性研究》，给很多关注播客的少数派网友发了私信，请求大家帮忙填填问卷，获得了大家的热情支持和鼓励，在这里先向所有帮助过我的少数派朋友们表示感谢！！！
除此之外，2020年对于我也有非常重要的影响。我在钟南山院士宣布”人传人“的当天离开北京回到了老家，准备过年，作为一个2020年的应届毕业生，我当时还在思考如何在春招中找到一份更加令人满意的工作，以及期待夏天的毕业典礼。后来的事情大家都知道，之后我再也没能以一个在校生的身份回到我的母校中国传媒大学。
2022年，我做了一档播客
6月30日，我的播客第一期正式上线，记录了我的好朋友在疫情之中裸辞，历经三个月四处求职的故事。这档播客的名字叫做《离开定福庄以后》，是一档以中国传媒大学毕业生为线索，记录当下青年生活经历的人物叙事类播客。开启这样一档播客有很多方面的考虑，比如可操作性强，选题丰富，没有同类型内容等等，但是最重要的一点是，我和很多朋友见过的最后一面都是在疫情之前，我们从大学进入社会的正常过程似乎被完全打断了，一转眼又是两年过去，我觉得记录下不同的人在毕业后的生活经历，是非常有价值，也是非常有群体代表性的。
我的播客封面
目前为止，我已经发布了总共六期播客，在国内各大音频平台同步更新。最近，《离开定福庄以后》在网易云音乐和小宇宙上的订阅收藏量刚刚破百，可以说是一档名副其实的小播客。一开始，我也幻想过会不会做出一期节目然后直接爆火，但自己当然也明白不太可能，做出来六期节目以后，我觉得自己心里很清楚的一点是，做播客，应该是一件细水长流的事情。对于一个从零开始、单打独斗的素人而言，能够收获大量听众的肯定只是极少数，而如果把播客当作一件需要慢慢耕耘的事情来做，做好自己喜欢的…</span>

                              <span>iOS 平台可以自定义小部件的 app 有很多，有那么几种是和代码相关的，例如 JSBox、Taio 和本文的这款 Scriptable。不用码的小部件，可以根据 app 提供的方式进行自定义，而用码的小部件，则可以完全根据自己的需求来写规则，并且可以组合不同类型的信息。有码就有了更强大的自定义属性，但同时又一定程度上提高了门槛。这时候就会出现很多已经写好的示例提供给使用者，不想研究的人开箱即用，懂码的人也可以根据需求自己改改。
虽然 Scriptable有官方推荐的小部件库，但是有一些小部件是无法做到开箱即用的，例如本文要讲的这一款 iTermWidget。这是一款长的像 iTerm 的 Widget。iTerm 是一款  macOS 平台的命令行工具。命令行就是用纯文字敲出来和展示出来的东西，而 iTerm 通过区分不同代码的颜色来让信息更加易读，这样的展示方式成为了一种特色，才出现了现在这个小部件。
想要一个这样的小组件，是因为其他 App 自带的小部件所能展示信息的方式比较有限，通常我只能选择开发者做好的样子。而这款 iTermWidget 最大的特点就是字小，意味着展示的信息够多。其次它没有过多复杂的展现方式，仅仅是依靠文字和换行颜色，从信息的传达上不够直观但足够简洁。可以拥有展示多达 6 行信息的小部件（并且还可以进一步自定义），是我一直想要的。
正常情况下，在软件自带的 Gallery 里面「GET」到这个小组件后直接运行，是没有办法成功的。我在前两次下载这个 Scriptable 的时候就败在了这一步，当时就删掉了。这款软件内的小部件都是用 JavaScript 来写的，没有代码基础的人就完全无从下手。而刚好最近我在学 JavaScript，心想也许能解决之前没有搞懂的问题，想再尝试一下。但不用担心，下面的内容不涉及到 JavaScript 的具体语法等内容…</span>

                              <span>趁着2019级非全日制统招研究生迎来毕业季，2023年考研院校发布招生简章的前夕，我想以一个当事人的身份来谈谈这个被称之为「水硕」的非全日制硕士研究生，聊一聊它的前世今生，探讨一下它的是非曲直，为后来者提供一份有价值的参考。
真的假文凭

“我初中毕业都能拿下党校学历，你说好拿不好拿?其实就是花钱买文凭。我还去上课，一个月上几天吧，就在县党校，很多领导课都不上。考试时答案都有小抄，可以买，考试时监考也不严， 可以抄。就是英语对我有点难，答案我事先都在书上找好了，考试时抄上就行了，这样英语也过了。 今年春上领的毕业证，函授本科。”

这是一段对某位干部的访谈记录，截取自一篇在体制内广为流传的博士论文《中县干部1》。2009年的中县干部群体，拥有本科研究生学历堪称「标配」。被戏称为「文凭批发基地」的党校、当地院校功不可没。在党政系统内，这类注水文凭是被承认的。客观的讲，学历只是门槛，但对于拥有正规国民教育序列学历的干部来说，似乎有些不公。
如果文凭代表的是对教育质量的衡量，那么忽略了教育质量的文凭，充其量也就是「真的假文凭」。在职学历的的含金量问题一直被社会所诟病，从生源的筛选，到培养过程，整个链条弥漫着不靠谱的味道。作为在职学历中顶级代表---在职硕士研究生也是如此，不免令人扼腕叹息。有识之士已经看出，现有的在职学历教育面对其所肩负的国民教育责任日渐力不从心。
随着国家日渐强盛，也出于从构建终身学习社会的目的，国家对非全日制学历下手改革是必然的趋势。剩下的问题就是什么时候改？从哪里下手改？怎么改？终于，2016年，教育部一纸通知2，正式将硕士研究生按照学习方式分为全日制硕士研究生与非全日制硕士研究生，并规定两者均采用全国硕士研究生统考的招生模式，执行相同的培养政策和标准，学历学位证书具有同等的法律地位和相同效力。在职研究生新政策前后区别见下表：

前言
前段时间谷歌开发者公众号发布了一个 compose 进阶挑战，挑战内容是完全使用 compose 编写一个计算器 APP。
思考了一下准备做一个“仿真”形式的计算器。
那么，既然想要做“仿真”，自然少不了显示效果的还原，经典的计算器都是使用的 LCD 显示屏，通过控制不同显象区域的显示与隐藏达到显示 0-9 的数字的目的。
显示效果大致如下：

本文的内容就是通过使用 compose 的自定义绘制(Canvas)，实现上图效果。
最终实现效果如图：

开始编写
使用直线绘制
绘制主体
仔细分析上图，不难发现，其实不过就是一个由3条短横线，4条长竖线构成的 “8” 字形显示区域，通过变换不同的线段显示隐藏来生成不同的数字。
既然如此，肯定想到的就是使用 drawLine 来实现。
首先定义一个 composable 函数：
@Composable
fun LcdNumber(
    number: Int,
    modifier: Modifier &#x3D; Modifier,
    defaultColor: Color &#x3D; Color.Gray,
    numberColor: Color &#x3D; Color.Black,
    numberSize: IntSize &#x3D; IntSize(10, 30)
)

其中， number 表示要显示的数字，这里只允许传入 0-9；defaultColor 表示线段没有显示时的默认颜色； numberColor 表示线段需要显示时的颜色； numberSize 表示绘制数字的区域大小。
在开始正式实现之前，我们需要先写几个辅助方法。
首先，我们需要判断某条线段是否应该显示，为了方便说明，我们把不同线段编号如下：

然后，编写判断方…</span>

2022 年 3 月辞职，没多久上海爆发疫情，蜗居在家准备面试。在经历 1 个月的闭关和 40+ 场 Android 面试后，拿到一些 offer。
总体上说，有如下几种面试题型：
基础知识
算法题
项目经历
场景题
场景题，即“就业务场景给出解决方案”，考察运用知识解决问题的能力。这类题取决于临场应变、长期积累、运气。
项目经历题取决于对工作内容的总结提炼、拔高升华、运气：
争取到什么样的资源
安排了怎么样的分工
搭建了什么样的架构
运用了什么模式
做了什么样的取舍
采用了什么策略
做了什么样的优化
解决了什么问题
力争把默默无闻的“拧螺丝”说成惊天动地的“造火箭”。（这是一门技术活）
但也不可避免地会发生“有些人觉得这是高大上的火箭，有些人觉得不过是矮小下的零件”。面试就好比相亲，甲之蜜糖乙之砒霜是常有的事。除非你优秀到解决了某个业界的难题。
算法题取决于刷题，运气，相较于前两类题，算法题可“突击”的成分就更多了。只要刷题足够多，胜算就足够大。大量刷，反复刷。
基础知识题是所有题型中最能“突击”的，它取决于对“考纲”的整理复习、归纳总结、背诵、运气。Android 的知识体系是庞杂的，对于有限的个人精力来说，考纲是无穷大的。
这不是一篇面经，把面试题公布是不讲武德的。但可以分享整个复习稿，它是我按照自己划定的考纲整理出的全部答案。
整个复习稿分为如下几大部分：
Android
Java &amp; Kotlin
设计模式 &amp; 架构
多线程
网络
OkHttp &amp; Retrofit
Glide
由于篇幅太长，决定把全部内容分成两篇分享给大家。其中，Android 和 Java &amp; Kotlin 已经在第一篇分享过，这一篇的内容是剩下的加粗部分。
设计模式/原则 &amp; 架构

单一职责原则：关于内聚的原则。高内聚、低耦合的指导方针，类或者方法单纯，只做一件事情

This article looks at what&#x27;s happening in industries related to energy and transportation when it comes to drastic costing changes that will lead to industrial disruption.
Business disruption is happening through new technology or methods, which will slash costs. This is forcing industrial change. Consider the oil, coal, natural gas, nuclear, petroleum, biof…</span>

在之前的 《炫酷的 3D 卡片和帅气的 360° 展示效果》 里，我们使用手势代码和角度切换，在 2D 画板里实现了“伪” 3D 的视觉效果，就在我觉得效果还不错时， 有一位掘友提出了一个关键性的问题：卡片缺少厚度，也就是没有 3D 的质感 。





确实，如下图所示，在之前的实现里，随着卡片角度的倾斜，有两个问题特别明显：
当卡片旋转到侧边时，卡片的缺少“厚度”的质感，甚至出现了消失的情况
卡片上的文字虽然做了类似凹凸的视觉效果，但是从侧面看时也是缺少立体质感

而为了在 2D 平面实现三唯的质感，在查阅相关资料时我发现了前端的 Zdog 框架，Zdog 是一个使用 Canvas 实现的伪 3D 引擎， 它支持通过 2D 的  Canvas  API渲染出类似 3D 的效果。
Zdog  作为一个 js 框架，它大概只有 2800 多行代码，并且其最小体积为 28KB ，可以说十分轻量级。

虽然 Zdog  是一个纯 js 框架， 但既然它是通过 Canvas 实现的逻辑，那就完全可以 “轻松” 迁移到 Flutter ，毕竟 Flutter 本身就是一个重度依赖于 Canvas  的框架，而恰巧在 Flutter 社区就有针对 Zdog 的移植版本： zflutter 。
虽然这个 package 作者已经两年不维护，也没有发布 null-safety 的 pub 支持，但是既然是开源项目，自己动手风衣足食，在经过一番“简单”的迁移适配之后， zf…</span>

前提
前一阵我参照教程：GAMEBOY 仿真器 做了一个game boy模拟器，经过漫长的调试，终于成功的在电脑上运行了起来，但作为一个移动端开发者，我最终还是想要在手机上运行，在经过一番研究后，我卡在了第一个难点：在Flutter中如何单独绘制每一个像素点呢？
Gamyboy的显示器尺寸是160 * 144，素点的格式是RGB，模拟器大概每隔16ms生成一帧画面，当模拟器运行时，我就能源源不断的拿到每一帧的像素数据（这里的像素数据可以看做是一个int32数组，长度为160 * 144），我要做的就是找到一种方法，将每一帧的像素数据绘制到屏幕上。一番搜素后，终于在How do I Render Individual Pixels in Flutter?上找到了答案
绘制像素点
想要直接绘制原始的像素点，需要用到Canvas的一个方法：
/// Draws the given [Image] into the canvas with its top-left corner at the
/// given [Offset]. The image is composited into the canvas using the given [Paint].
void drawImage(Image image, Offset offset, Paint paint)

从方法签名中可以看出，canvas绘制的是一个Image对象，它持有原始的像素数据，所以我们需要先将像素数据转换成Image对象，可以使用decodeImageFromPixels方法
/// Convert an array of pixel values into an [Image] object.
///
/// The &#x60;pixels&#x60; parameter is…</span>

“终于懂了” 系列：组件化框架 ARouter 完全解析（二）AGP/Transform—动态代码注入
在上一篇《“终于懂了” 系列：组件化框架 ARouter 完全解析（一） 原理详解》中，详细介绍了ARouter的核心原理。其中提到了“帮助类”的概念，也就是在运行时生成 用于帮助填充WareHouse路由元信息的类，这里就涉及到了APT技术。那么本篇就对这一技术点进行介绍，并详细分析ARouter中是如何使用APT来生成帮助类的。
一、APT介绍
1.1 APT的理解
APT(Annotation Processing Tool)，即 注解处理器，是javac中提供的编译时扫描和处理注解的工具，它对源代码文件进行检测找出其中的注解，然后使用注解进行额外的处理。
注解就像是一个标签，有很多类型，可以贴在某些元素上面进行标记，并且标签上可以写一些信息。APT就是用来处理标签的工具，在编译开始后，可以拿到自己所关心的类型的所有标签，然后根据标签信息和被标记的元素信息，做一些事情。做那些事呢，这就看你如何写APT了，你让他干啥他就干啥，通常都是会生成一些帮助类——帮助完成你的目的的类。 后面无论对这种标签的使用是增加、减少了，每次编译都会重新走这一过程，而上一次的处理结果会被清空。
宏观上理解，APT就是javac提供给开发者在编译时处理注解的一种技术；微观上，具体到实例中就是指 继承自javax.annotation.processing.AbstractProcessor 的实现类，即一个处理特定注解的处理器。（下文提到的APT都是宏观上理解，具体的处理器简称为Processor）
那不使用APT…</span>

前言
在上一篇普通的加载千篇一律，有趣的 loading 万里挑一
中，我们介绍了使用Path类的PathMetrics属性来控制绘制点在路径上运动来实现比较有趣的loading效果。有评论说因为是黑色背景，所以看着好看。黑色背景确实显得高端一点，但是并不是其他配色也不行，本篇我们来封装一个可以自定义配置前景色和背景色的Loading组件。
组件定义
loading组件共定义4个入口参数：
前景色：绘制图形的前景色；
背景色：绘制图形的背景色；
图形尺寸：绘制图形的尺寸；
加载文字：可选，如果有文字就显示，没有就不显示。
得到的Loading组件类如下所示：
class LoadingAnimations extends StatefulWidget {
  final Color bgColor;
  final Color foregroundColor;
  String? loadingText;
  final double size;
  LoadingAnimations(
      {required this.foregroundColor,
      required this.bgColor,
      this.loadingText,
      this.size &#x3D; 100.0,
      Key? key})
      : super(key: key);

  @override
  _LoadingAnimationsState createState() &#x3D;&gt; _LoadingAnimationsState();
}

这是看了RenderObject的源码，写的一个总结性的小widget。使用到了Flutter里的自定义RenderObjectWidget 手势 动画等知识点。
该widget实现的功能
左右无限循环滚动
模拟物理阻尼滑动
滑动结束自动归位
缘起
之前项目中有用到首页Banner的组件(左右无限滑动，自动切换)，那会一直奉行拿来主义有轮子能跑就行，不去重复造轮子。所以在网上找了受欢迎的几个组件，比较好奇都是怎么实现的无限切换。大致分为两类:
定义一个很大的ListView比如30w个，然后把当前的位置定位到中间第15w个下标，以这样的方式实现左右无限滑动，左右两边都可以滑15w次，从日常使用的角度来讲实现了无限滑动。
在实际的轮播数量之上额外再加上2个widget，第1项前面加入最后1项widget，最后1项的后面加入第1项widget。比如有6个轮播图，那实际顺序就是F A B C D E F A。默认显示下标1的widgetA，当往右边滑动时就会到下标0显示出F，在完成切换到下标0后重新设置PageView的位置为(n-2)，也就是下标6对应的F实现无限滑动， 左滑同理
这两种方式都是使用框架提供的基础组建封装而成的，第一种方式从程序的角度来讲是伪无限，第二种方式是真无限但是在第一项和最后一项会停住没法连续滚动 像这个样子：

我希望的样子是这样:

无限滑动
前面有提到的两种方案比较容易实现，代码量很少使用现有的滑动widget(ListView和PageView)即可。这里开始正式讲不借助ListView、PageView来实现无限滑动的逻辑。
忘掉上面的两种方式，我们这里是通过RenderObject实现那么一切的widget都听我号令。只要想通什么是无限循环----即首位相连，第一个前面的永远是最后一个，最后一个的前面永远是第一个。

前言
关于倒计时可以说我们App开发中常见的一种场景了，比如Splash倒计时跳转首页，比如发送短信之后倒计时60秒显示等等。
关于倒计时的实现方式，大家可能有不同的做法，这里做一下总结看看你使用的是哪一种呢？
一、CountDownTimer的实现
直接上代码
      //倒计时的方式一
        fun countDownTimer() {
            var num &#x3D; 60

            timer &#x3D; object : CountDownTimer((num + 1) * 1000L, 1000L) {

                override fun onTick(millisUntilFinished: Long) {

                    YYLogUtils.w(&quot;当时计数：&quot; + num)

                    if (num &#x3D;&#x3D; 0) {
                        YYLogUtils.w(&quot;重新开始&quot;)
                        num &#x3D; 60
                    } else {
                        num--
                    }

                }

                override fun onFinish() {
                    YYLogUtils.w(&quot;倒计时结束了...&quot; + num)

              …</span>

&quot;Why Clojure?&quot; is probably the question we&#x27;ve been asked the most at Penpot. We have a vague explanation on our FAQ page, so with this article, I&#x27;ll explain the motivations and spirit behind our decision.
It all started in a PIWEEK. Of course!
During one of our Personal Innovation Weeks (PIWEEK) in 2015, a small team had the idea to create an open source prototyping tool. They started work immediately, and were able to release a working prototype after a week of hard work (and lots of fun). This was the first static prototype, without a backend.
I was not part of the initial team, but there were many reasons to choose ClojureScript back then. Building…</span>

此小细节问题在稀土掘金/B站漫画/青藤之恋等使用Flutter的APP都存在，主要原因使用官方在使用定义iOS/Android两个平台的光标有不同实现机制；核心实现类在Editable.dart中

    assert(defaultTargetPlatform !&#x3D; null);
    switch (defaultTargetPlatform) {
      case TargetPlatform.iOS:
      case TargetPlatform.macOS:

近两年来工信部对于应用的隐私合规安全问题愈加重视，对 Android 平台的管控程度也要比 IOS 平台严格很多，很多不合规的应用也先后被下架要求整改。笔者就曾遇到过加班整改隐私合规的问题，隐私合规问题主要针对两个方面。
在用户同意隐私协议之前不能收集用户隐私数据，例如 IMEI、AndroidId、MAC 等
在用户同意隐私协议之后，收集用户数据行为在对应场景不能超频。比如一分钟不能超过 3 次获取 IMEI
针对上述两个方面，有以下措施来针对
通过静态扫描，收集项目中（自有代码 + 三方 sdk）使用隐私合规相关 api 的相关代码
通过 ASM 插桩，在调用隐私合规 api 之前插入代码，记录运行时的方法调用链和当前时间
hook 隐私合规 api，替换字节码指令将调用链指向工具类，在未同意隐私协议之前，不调用相关的 api
2.实现
2.1 注解和工具类
通过定义注解和工具类，用来定义要处理哪些隐私合规相关的方法，目前笔者已经处理了大部分，请放心食用
2.1.1 注解
/**
 * 收集和注解匹配的方法
 * visitMethodInsn(int opcode, String owner, String name,String desc)

 * &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;如果 originName 和 originDesc 传&quot;&quot;，逻辑会在插件中处理&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;

mmap初入
我们常说的mmap，其实是一种内存映射文件的方法，mmap将一个文件或者其它对象映射进内存。但是更加确切的来说，其实是linux中的线性区提供的可以和基于磁盘文件系统的普通文件的某一个部分相关联的操作。线性区其实是由进程中连续的一块虚拟文件区域，由struct vm_area_struct结构体表示，我们的mmap操作，其实就是最本质的，就是通过其进行的内存操作。
按照归类的思想，其实mmap主要用到的分为两类（还有其他标识不讨论）
共享的：即对该线性区中的页（注意是以页为单位）的任何写操作，都会修改磁盘上的文件，并且如果一个进程对进行了mmap的页进行了写操作，那么对于其他进程（同样也通过mmap进行了映射），同样也是可见的
私有的：对于私有映射页的任何写操作，都会使linux内核停止映射该文件的页（注意，假如有进程a，b同时映射了该页，a对页进行了修改，此时这个页就相当于复制出来了一份，a以后的操作就在复制的该页进行操作，b还是引用原来的页，原来的页就可以继续参与内存映射，而复制出来的页，就被停止映射了），因此，在私有情况下，写操作是不会改变磁盘上的文件，同时所做的修改对于其他进程来说，就是不可见的。

mmap分析
概念我们有了，我们看一下代码mmap定义
#if defined(__USE_FILE_OFFSET64)
void* mmap(void* __addr, size_t __size, int __prot, int __flags, int __fd, off_t __offset) __RENAME(mmap64);

因此我们要发布Library到Maven Central的话，首先需要Sonatype的账号以及权限。
申请 Sonatype 账号
申请账号地址： https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/Signup!default.jspa
登录账号创建issue
创建issue地址：https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/ViewProfile.jspa

点击 Create 按钮, 然后会弹出 Create Issue的窗口：

点击Configure Fields, 选择 Custom 选项

grouId的话最好使用: io.github.github_name, 要不然使用其他的还需要在 DNS 配置中配置一个TXT记录来验证域名所有权
填写完所有的信息点击创建，一个新的issue就创建成功了，以下就是我创建的issue，附上链接：https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-83290

TL;DR
⚠️ 修改注册表前记录备份原始值，如果出问题还能恢复！修改注册表务必谨慎！修改注册表务必谨慎！修改注册表务必谨慎！重要的话说三遍！
如果出现 Windows Xbox Game Bar 录制的视频在 Apple 设备上播放出现绿边或花屏的情况，可以尝试。

Win + R 输入 regedit，打开注册表编辑器；
左边目录依次定位到 HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\GameDVR，打开后看右边；
VideoEncodingResolutionMode 双击打开，将值改为 0；
CustomVideoEncodingHeight 改为 1080（十进制）；
CustomVideoEncodingWidth 改为 1920（十进制）；
保存重启计算机，搞定。

奇怪的故障

                              <span>截止到今天，Android的生态发生了不少变化
以前的鼎盛时期，堪称是个公司就做App，由于当时市场上缺乏Android开发，招聘往往是低要求、高薪资，只要你面试说得上四大组件，第二天马上拎包入职，线下的Android培训也是一抓一大把，吸引了一大批人涌入Android开发行业。Android招聘市场的需求逐渐被填充，招聘要求逐步提高……
随着“互联网寒冬”的到来，大批互联网公司纷纷倒闭，大厂也纷纷裁员节流，人才供给大幅增加、需求大幅降低，造成当时的市场迅速达到饱和。培训出来的初级Android开发找不到工作，大厂被裁员的Android开发放不下薪资要求，这批人找不到工作，再加上当时自媒体的大肆渲染，Android开发可不就“凉了”吗？
毫不夸张的说，早期说得上四大组件稍微能做一点点，拿个15-20k是比较轻松的，要是你还有过完整开发经验，30k真是一点都不过分，而在“寒冬”之后，当招聘市场供给过剩时，面试官有了充分的选择权，你会四大组件，那我就有完整App独立开发经验，另一人或许有过十万级App开发经验，你说面试官会收下谁呢？岗位招聘要求也是在这时迅速拔高，整个Android市场逐渐趋于平稳，大家感觉Android开发来到了内卷期……
再来说现在：
Android凉了吗？
其实并不是Android凉了，而是技术不过硬的Android凉了
被高薪晃晕了头脑放不下身段的假高工凉了
现在的Android市场，Android初级工程师早就已经严重饱和了，供远大于求。这就导致了很多Android开发会面临被优化、被毕业、找不到工作这种情况，然后这部分人又出来说Android凉了，如此循环之下，以致于很多人都觉得Android凉了……
其核心原因只是Android开发市场由鼎盛的疯狂逐渐趋于平稳
这里也给出Android开发薪资/年限图给大家参考：

前言
使用虎撲APP時，注意到個人頁面上的勳章展示區，勳章會隨手機的轉動而移動掉落。很喜歡這個效果，也很好奇是怎麼實現的，便想在flutter上嘗試重現出來，當作練習項目。

思路
在這邊大致列幾個關鍵點
基本運動
邊界碰撞
相互碰撞
球體自轉
基本運動
使用sensors_plus
我這裡選用加速度感測的監聽，ValueNotifier來觸發刷新取代setstate。
import &#x27;package:sensors_plus/sensors_plus.dart&#x27;;

ValueNotifier&gt; phoneXY &#x3D; ValueNotifier([0, 0]);

StreamSubscription sensor &#x3D; accelerometerEvents.listen((AccelerometerEvent event) {
  phoneXY.value &#x3D; [event.x, event.y];
});

由於sensors_plus在安卓端適用SensorManager默認 SENSOR_DELAY_NORMAL靈敏度不高，可以手動修改套件的本地緩存，或是把sensors_plus colne下來改成私有專案(以下是兩種引用私有庫方式)。
sensors_plus:
  git:
    url: https://github.com/xxx/sensors_plus.git
    
sensors_plus:
  path: xxx/sensors_plus

前言
南京自古以来都是「国家历史文化名城」，高铁通车以后，南京更是来自安徽的朋友们求学、工作的热门目的地，所以南京又有了「徽京」这一玩味的美誉。想必这也是我经常被问及：「你当初为什么选择去合肥而不是南京」这一问题的主要原因。
或许比起南京这样能够轻松勾起读者画面感的城市而言，合肥的存在感就低得多了。想必若非特殊的原因的话，假期出游或者是计划一场旅行，大家一般不会首选这样「少有话题性」城市作为目的地。
城市通勤，总能收到来自合肥地铁三号线的「祝福」
在合肥工作生活的一年半，我也从未踏足徽州诸如黄山、淮南、芜湖（此处应有感叹号）等地的风景名胜，也没走过合肥热门的包公园、步行街、逍遥津、合柴1972；而是乘着地铁、骑着小车走遍了合肥市不少算得上人迹罕至的角落。写到最后发现比起城市景观和风光，合肥最美的还是人和事儿；若您到访合肥，不妨轻装而行，感受这些小地方的「方寸之间，自有天地」。
但如果您准备启程前往合肥工作或求学，那恭喜你来到了可能是「最美的」城市，如标题所说的：

愿您在合肥找到「平静」。

在合肥：「不游山，不玩水」
大蜀山下｜烧烧香、钓钓鱼
爬「大蜀山」似乎是属于热爱运动的合肥朋友们，周末相约的日常。但本就不爱运动，又迷恋那什么疯狂星期四的朋友们，或许会选择一些相对柔和的方式寻访大蜀山。
烧香的时候，南山寺的大师傅有说最好不要正面拍菩萨，所以这是网图。
位于大蜀山脚下的开福禅寺，是公交和地铁能够轻松到达的位置，随着2001年市政府在毁于日军侵华战火的遗址中重建以来，开福寺一直燃着本地居民「期盼平安」的香火。虽说是依山而建，开…</span>

学术生活苦海无涯，难免会遇到几个小组作业，比如：撰写一篇综述、进行一次汇报（Pre）等。在当今疫情的背景下，小组作业也大多以线上的形式开展。收集资料、小组讨论、头脑风暴、论文撰写......在多次合作中，我尝试了多种工具并构建了自己的小组作业工作流。
从资料收集到论文撰写，下面这些工具覆盖了小组合作的全流程。用好这些工具，也许能够让小组合作的过程事半功倍。
资料收集
Zotero 群组文库：一起搭建文献库
无论是做汇报还是写综述，论文的收集和阅读往往是极为重要的一环。一个共享的文献库可以让资料收集的过程效率更高，并且在后续论文写作中也会更加方便。例如：在使用 Better BibTeX 插件来快速引用论文时，所有人的 Citation Key 都会保持一致，以免出现由于 Key 不一致导致的同一篇文献被多次重复引用的问题。
Zotero 是一款被广泛使用的文献管理软件。Zotero 除了最为常见的个人文库之外，还提供了群组文库功能。它的使用与普通的个人文库用法几乎完全一致，你在文库中做的任何修改都会被实时同步到其他人的设备上。
Zotero 群组文库功能
创建一个共享文库也十分简单。只需要前往 Zotero 官网 就可以新建一个群组。在新建完成后，只需要输入其他用户的 Zotero 账户邮箱即可发送邀请。

easyScholor：文献期刊等级查询
为了保证参考文献的质量，老师有时会要求作业中所引用的论文需要达到一定的标准，例如必须是 SCI/EI 收录等。并且，不同学校对期刊的认定标准还可能不同。为了保证所有人在收集的文献都符合要求，可以尝试使用 easyScholor 这款浏览器插件。

工作日丢办公室，周末带回去，出门也有公用电脑，用着倒也还行。年初家里宽带升级，抱着电脑楼上楼下测速，便携性差这一劣势大大展现出来了，再看到 Intel 12 代酷睿性能提升巨大，所以换掉这台“便携式台式机 ”，选一台“便携式笔记本”，一番对比后选择了幻 16 。
日常使用体验
我选购的是 i9-12900H + RTX 3080Ti 顶配版本，使用了三个月中有失望也有惊喜。幻 16 机身黑色比较低调，整机 2.0 KG，对比 ThinkBook 16 的 1.8 KG 稍重，比 MacBook 16 的 2.1 KG 稍轻，久经考验如我自然觉得轻的不行。幻 16 的游戏元素较少，加上之后的性能表现，它更像全能本而不是游戏本。

幻 16 搭载一块 2560 * 1600 165 Hz 高刷新率屏幕，屏幕顶部有 IR 红外摄像头，支持 Windows Hello 面部识别，无论白天黑夜都可以快速识别进入桌面，幻 16 也可以单手开合，这些配合 新型待机（Modern Standby1）体验相当好，开盖唤醒解锁一气呵成，可以媲美 iPhone ，比起俺游戏本要从休眠中再唤醒不知道高到哪里去。
手机拍出的红外光还蛮酷炫
屏幕显示效果也不错，如果分辨率再高些就更好了，那样能开 200% 缩放获得更好显示效果。幻 16 在日常使用还是相当静音安静的，键盘手感不错，而且触摸板面积很大堪可一用，配备了 90 Wh 的大电池续航还可以，在 4~6 小时间。

                              <span>当一个作家在书写「写作」时，无论 TA 是有心还是无意，关于写作的一切都会被暴露。寻着蛛丝马迹，你可以在文章里找到同样困扰自己的问题，有心的读者或许还就能在字里行间里找到自己的答案。
我一直对作家的对话访谈录更感兴趣。它们犹如窥视镜，让我管中窥豹「到底何为作家般的生活」？ TA 们的生活，是只有阅读和写作吗？TA 们描述的故事如此精彩，那故事之外的故事又是什么样的？
埃莱娜·费兰特是一位几乎不抛头露面的作家。除了必要的文学作品，她对表达自己的态度和观点相当吝啬。她是毛姆的另一个极端。我对她的兴趣始于《碎片》，但《碎片》未能完全喂食我的好奇。所以《偶然的创造》发表之后，我再一次让自己掉入了她的世界。不过这一次，我想知道的问题很明确：费兰特的写作，是什么样的？
 为什么是写作？
写作，对于一个作家来说是什么？华莱士会把它描述为「瘾」，没有这个出口，身心的某处机能就会出现故障。这种瘾在费兰特这儿，被描述为「必要的写作」：出版可以延缓，但写作刻不容缓。想写作的人一定要写作。1
如果给写作这事儿做 SWOT 分析的话，费兰特的四象限里，弊那一栏几乎可以填满：害怕交稿；害怕要在不想写的情况下写作；害怕写出的文章冒犯到读者；害怕作品没有尽善尽美就草草收场；害怕失去信心；害怕放弃。但其他三栏，费兰特只列了一条：好奇心。最后我的好奇心占了上风。2
有没有觉得似曾相识？同样的事《老友记》里的 Ross 也做过，他在 Rachel 和 Jolie 之间摇摆不定，他列出了一长串 Rachel 的毛病，但最后优点他也只列了一条：因为她是 Rachel。纵使写作有千万种让你惧怕的理由，但你还是会选择它，因为它是写作。写作后的喜悦冲散了发表的焦虑不安。3
如果写作仅仅是因为必要，那这个理由未免有点牵强，尤其对大多数普通的你我而言。在成为自由撰稿人之后，我深刻的体会到规律写作之必要。但不客气的说，写作是一…</span>

我是一名大二在读的本科生，经过大学一年的摸索，自认为对知识管理方面有一定的心得，想和各位分享一下。首先讲一下我的使用知识管理软件的理念：

不盲目追求all in one，专业的事要交给专业软件去做。
好的软件应该有助于思维方式的培养，而不是束缚自己的思考。

我将这个系统分为输入-暂存-整理-输出四部分，涵盖了知识的获取到内化的全流程，每个流程我基本都使用了不同的工具，思维导图如下。

 
一、知识输入
在信息爆炸的互联网时代，我们最不缺的就是信息，如何寻找到有用的信息便成为了关键，下面先罗列几个我平常获取知识的方式
实体书籍
我曾在网课期间有一段时间强迫自己进行完全电子化的学习，但我始终无法适应，来来回回看各种教程，折腾各类笔记软件也费时费力，于是我还是买来了纸质的课本和笔记本。对于我来说，实体书籍在我的学习中仍然占有很大一部分，简单快捷的体验可以让我更加专注于书中的内容。看到想要摘录的内容时我会手打到Flomo中，进行一个初步的提炼，也可以加深印象。虽然是分享数字文具盒，但我还是要提醒大家，不要盲目迷恋数字技术，有时回归实体也不失为一个好方法。
论文期刊网站
刚步入大学时我还没有查论文期刊的习惯，有啥新碰到的专业术语还是第一时间去查百度，得到的结果往往不知所云，有时还有很多纰漏。作为在校大学生，一般都是可以免费访问学校购买过的知网、维普、百度学术等网站的论文资源的，国外的论文也可以查谷歌学术和Sci-Hub，这些都比百度搜索出来的结果靠谱的多。
关于学术搜索有一个技巧，就是多使用「高级搜索」功能，可以找到更加准确的结果。有时你想搜索的一个定理可能不包含在论文标题中，这时在高级搜索中使用关键词搜索就会更容易检索到。以知网为例：

我想要搜索热传导当中一个叫「傅里叶定律」的东西，但直接在主题中搜索，结果太少，于是我在高级搜索中在左边选择关键…</span>

                              <span>经济独立后，我很快发现自己之前的消费方式需要调整。
我之前买东西几乎没有计划，大部分是偶发性的，也有很多冲动购买。其次，我对价格有些不敏感，总觉得平台上是这个价格那就这样吧；对很多产品的质量也没有概念，常常不知道该从何判断。比如买水果，我都是让商家随机装一些就过秤拿走。我也很少考虑买东西之后的处置行为，比如多久该把东西淘汰，日用品一般要屯多久等等。
我逐渐觉得，我应该花些心思调整自己的生活和消费——我需要一个能让我在「重复购买」「快速更迭」的商品上省钱，可以为生活长远算计的在线平台。1688 就这样进入了我的视野。
1688 建立的初衷是为批发商或者商户找到合适的生产商，由于平台允许商户购买样品，所以个人消费者也可以在 1688 上进行购买。在 1688 平台进行了大半年采买后，我想和大家分享一下我的购物体验和购物感受，也欢迎各位朋友分享你的「批发」心得。
本文分享的所有产品和卖家均是来自于自己及朋友购买经历，不含有任何广告或者宣传。
在 1688 购物的原因
在 1688 购物主要就是为了两方面：规划预算省钱，适量囤货日用。1688 正好在这两点都是强项。
各大社交平台都有博主提过，同款的产品，其他购物平台基本价格一致，而 1688 上可以便宜一半甚至是更多。因为 1688 上的卖方是生产商，少了很多分销渠道的成本和加价。这也是为什么 1688 会有很多东西便宜到让人惊讶的原因，毕竟「要批发，上 1688」。
举个例子，我在南方经常要用的除湿袋，在 1688 上的价格是 0.7 元一包，购买超过 250 包，会便宜到 0.68 元。而在当地超市买到的同款至少一包 2 元，有些网购平台甚至要 5 元一包。
这是我楼下超市卖的同款，非常好用，五块钱一包。
偶尔一包可能价格差距不大，但这种除湿袋我每年都会用掉很多，累计起来就不在少数了，带上全寝室批发则开销更大。类似的还有袜子、…</span>

                              <span>「记录」这件事就是非常有威力，它会把注意力之外的小细节收集起来，给予一种确实发生但又意料之外的生活视角。比如如果不是记账，我不知道原来每个月会支出那么多零零碎碎的「拿铁因子」；如果不是 HiWater，我也不会知道原来自己摄入那么多含糖饮料。
其实我很早之前就购买过 WaterMinder 这款 App Store Editors&#x27;s Choice 应用，只是彼时的我并不明白「多喝水」三个字对身体的意义，同时也觉得记录喝水这件事就像是记账——没有外部约束、「记录多少全凭诚实美德」的记录只在于自我娱乐。所以往往三天后意兴阑珊删除了事。
HiWater 则是好友 @特伦 推荐的，把玩了下觉得还不错，但当时并不想为这个需求掏钱；不久前确诊痛风后，离开诊室满心灰暗的我有了「每天喝水 3L+」的刚需，这才发现这款应用的每一个付费点都值得我掏钱。
作为一款国产应用，HiWater 的饮品目录预设种类都比较契合日常，并且在目录处还醒目地标注了每 100 毫升所带有的千卡热量。向下翻阅到高热量饮品时甚至有一种黑名单的既视感。

如此设计的部分原因是，HiWater 采用了「饮水金字塔」模型，它将所有饮品归在六个等级内，并依此建议每日摄入的比例。此模型虽有哈佛大学公共卫生学院专家的背书，总体指导思想依然是鼓励大家多喝白水，减少摄入高糖、甚至是含糖饮料。

对喝水提醒应用来说，我们一般会面临预设饮品难以覆盖真实世界情况的问题。
所以在 HiWater 中我们也可以新增或编辑饮品类目到「饮水金字塔」模型中，把某个模糊的品类变成精确的单品。比如说 HiWater 预设了椰子水这个饮品，但我日常喝得比较多的是山姆椰子水，那我就直接编辑成山姆椰子水的营养成分，并重新归类到低卡饮料分类中去；再比如我喝的柠檬水是浓缩液和水 1:10 冲兑而来，因此我也通过计算将预设的「柠檬水」编辑成「自制柠檬水」，并由浓缩液计算出对应的热量。
当然，手动编辑多了我们自然就会想：这些外包装上带有营养成分表的商品饮料，如何快捷记录到应用内？
HiWater 的答案是「直接用相机扫」，请直接看这个动图：

我猜测可能 Apple 在系统中给了 OCR 相关的 API，开发者就取来做这个功能了。这是我最喜欢的功能，实际使用起来识别比动图中要更迅速，识别率高且稳定。偶尔可能会有一些识别错误，比如把 ≥ 识别成 2，但我也能原谅。
如此一来，在机场购买的农夫山泉力量帝柠檬水、屯了两箱的兰芳园低糖冻柠茶，都可以统统扫入我的饮品目录。记录时也可以根据自己的实际情况调整，比如冻柠茶虽是低糖，我还是会将它兑冰水或柠檬水喝，因此我的喝水记录里经常会出现 50 毫升的冻柠茶、紧接着出现 200 毫升的水或柠檬水。

之前做手冲咖啡用的秤，现在大多被我用于称水喝，但后续我发现只要记住水倒在杯子上的花纹位置，不用秤也能大致知道这杯水的量。以名创优品的 580 毫升容积的可乐杯为例，杯内两道凹痕，分别可以粗略看作是 200/500 毫升的刻度。在公司喝水，可以考虑在工位启用大杯子装水，之前因为杯子小+次数少，上班时喝水太少。一周下来，确实每日喝水 3.3L 以上。

其余的基础功能，诸如弹出提醒用户喝水、身体水分的简单预估、根据用户情况估算需要摄入的水量等，我就不一一展开了，WaterMinder 也有，我认为这些是一款「喝水类」App 都应该做的免费功能。其实我原先也是想通过快捷指令自己做一个提醒和记录每日喝水的应用，这不难，我甚至已经做好了 社死版快捷指令 定时运行，但体验过 HiWater 的一些交互后，我最后决定不折腾自己了。
应用内还有不少花心思的交互和设计
HiWater 多样的桌面小组件，还支出快捷录入饮品，打破了我对 iOS 小组件「能看不能用」的固有认知（我原先在 iOS 上并不使用任何 Widget，这一下就微上瘾了，顺带一口气添加了其余应用的小组件 xD）。
精美的 Widget，支持快捷录入
HiWater 采用免费下载+内购解锁的付费机制，如果你看完文章对它感兴趣，安装来把玩把玩也可以。如果想要为它付费的话，建议先确认自己有强烈的督促自己喝水的需求，然后订阅一个月试试——我直接买断是因为意识到「多喝水」这样的生活我可能要持续好几个月，甚至好几年，本身并不是很理性的消费习惯。
如果一个应用能够帮助我长期维持某个健康习惯，我愿意给出「十刀买断，天大划算」的评价；如果没有，我也会用「三分钟热度三分钟收获」来安慰自己。

                              <span>🌟 Part 1 不想错过精彩内容

2022 年 2 月 7 日，我由于一些契机接触到了少数派。1 个月里，我阅读了很多大家写的文章，当时的感觉就是：哇，少数派的作者写的东西太真诚了，每一篇文章的背后都是一段实实在在的亲身实践。对于我而言，虽然自己也会记笔记，但是它们总是零零散散，后面回顾的效果也不是特别好。最后干脆也不经常整理和看笔记了。
然而我又不想错过少数派写的诸如《Power +》等文章的精华，因此甚是苦恼。假如有一个机器，能够帮助我轻松地记录「小灵感 / 知识碎片 / 心得体会」，并且还能够帮助我更好地进行回顾就好了。当然，也不是说就要一字不落的把全文都背下来，没必要。所以我希望它可以让我在打开手机的时候，能够把我之前学习的知识链条清晰地展示出来。

注：文中的链接会在文末一并再次放出，开启深色模式可以获得最佳阅读体验

🌟 Part 2 与 Flomo 相识

在想法诞生的第二天，我就在少数派探索到了 Flomo。在这之前，我几乎从来没有系统化地整理过知识（高考笔记除外），也没有做过任何对外的内容输出。
当时就想，这白白绿绿的 App 看着还挺轻盈，有一种树林小草在生长的感觉。打开后瞬间被它极简的界面吸引住了 —— 每当你需要写一张小卡片的时候，你只需要像发微博一样，点击下方的加号即可撰写内容。
简单尝试之后，发现 App 的配色、间距都非常的统一，每一条内容就是一张精美的小卡片。用 Flomo 写作有一种极强的沉浸感。于是我开始用它来记录自己每一个时刻迸发的想法，以及摘录和批注在少数派读到的受启发的内容（如图）；接着对它进行批注，来记录思考后的链接卡片。整个使用过程中没有任何规则和冗长的教学来约束我「应该如何去用一款笔记 App」，仿佛在写朋友圈，简单而便捷。

前阵子收到了小宇宙的消息推送，我才发现不知不觉，我已经在小宇宙听了 200 小时播客了，最开始只是偶尔听听，后来越来越喜欢，几乎每天只有有空就都要打开小宇宙，把听播客这个习惯无缝融入到了我的日常 routine 中。
今天这一篇，我想复盘一下在我从播客萌新到播客重度听众的这 200 个小时中我的收获和体验，以及对播客这种内容形式的思考。
我喜欢听哪些播客？
我收听的播客领域主要集中在这几类：互联网、商业分析、心理学、轻松休闲类。

📻 互联网行业：《三五环》《温柔一刀》《组织进化论》等等
📻 商业分析：《无人知晓》《疯投圈》
📻 心理学：《得意忘形》
📻 轻松休闲类：《日谈公园》《谐星聊天会》

我一般都是在家用电脑做一些不需要太集中精力的工作的时候，会去听我喜欢的一些有信息量的播客，收听到有价值的信息的时候，会直接打开电脑上的记事本，或者用 flomo 记录下当时觉得有价值的信息和思考。
而一个人出门散步、吃饭的时候，会放日谈公园或者谐星聊天会这种信息浓度不高的播客，作为放松休闲的背景音。
我的小宇宙收听总结里收听时长最长的播客是张潇雨老师的《得意忘形》，刘飞老师的《三五环》以及孟岩老师的《无人知晓》。这三档播客也是我目前最喜欢的三档播客。

播客为什么吸引了我？
在听了 200 个小时的播客之后，我开始对播客这一内容形式有了一些思考，我开始想：
播客为什么吸引到了我，能让我愿意付出这么多时间去使用它？播客这一种内容形式，和其他的内容形式又有什么特别之处？
我尝试着从我自己作为普通用户的角度，也夹杂着我作为一个内容运营的…</span>
