After providing tens of thousands of Starlink terminals to help Ukraine’s war effort, SpaceX has told the Department of Defense that it may not be able to provide future funding for the service, CNN reports. In a letter dated September 8th, the company’s director of government sales reportedly wrote that SpaceX is “not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time.” 
The terminals have provided essential connectivity to Ukraine during its war with Russia. Putin’s war machine has targeted Ukraine’s communications infrastructure as part of its invasion of the country, but Starlink’s satellite-based internet connectivity has provided an effective way for Ukraine’s...

Microsoft is bringing GPU decompression to Windows PC games soon. After launching DirectStorage earlier this year, GPU decompression promises to be the next step in the ongoing effort to improve game load times on PCs. Microsoft says it’s “one of our most highly requested features” from game developers.
GPU decompression works by offloading the work needed to decompress assets in games to the graphics card instead of the CPU. Modern games include massive amounts of assets like characters, landscapes, and objects that are all compressed to reduce the total size of a game. 
“Typically, decompression work is done on the CPU because compression formats have historically been optimized for CPUs only,” explains Cassie Hoef, a senior program...

During Meta’s Connect conference on Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg made a huge announcement: the avatars in the company’s Horizon VR app will be getting legs soon. To demonstrate this groundbreaking technical achievement, Zuckerberg’s digital avatar lifted each leg in the air, then did a jump, while Aigerim Shorman’s avatar kicked into the air.
It may have all been for show. According to UploadVR editor Ian Hamilton, an unnamed Meta spokesperson said that the “the segment featured animations created from motion capture,” meant to “enable this preview of what’s to come.” To me that reads like what we saw wasn’t actually a demo of what Horizon’s legs will look like, but rather an artist’s interpretation of what Horizon’s legs may end up looking...

Amazon wasn’t the only one offering a deluge of deals earlier this week. If you were looking for alternative places to shop during Amazon’s Prime Early Access Sale — perhaps one that didn’t require you to sign up for a premium membership — Walmart was featuring many of the same deals, dropping notable discounts on standouts like the Apple Watch Series 8 and Beats Fit Pro. While many of the sales have ended, Walmart is still offering discounts on a handful of items, none of which require a Walmart Plus membership to take advantage of. 
Below, we’ve rounded up a selection of the best deals you can still get from Walmart’s “Rollbacks and More” sale. Admittedly, the options are limited, but perhaps a new pair of earbuds or a smartwatch is...

                              <span>According to Statista, MongoDB ranks 5th among the most popular database(DB) management systems worldwide as of August 2022.  
Other top-ranking DBs are Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL. Mongo DB is the only NoSQL database ranking that high from the list. 
MongoDB offers many advantages over traditional relational databases.  With MongoDB Atlas, the cloud offering by MongoDB, you have access to a collection of services that all integrate nicely with your database.
I love this feature and as a software developer, I use Mongo DB for this reason. 
This feature provides high performance (speed) and makes it easy to accommodate product scalability(growth). It&#x27;s cost-effective as you will always find a plan that suits your project need and production budget. 
MongoDB supports creating clearer schemas and data validation. This flexibility is an incredible asset when handling real-world data and changes in production requirements or environments.
Hope this helps anyone out there thinking of what database to use for the next project!</span>

What ended up costing you more than expected? If you use Kubernetes, here’s how you can find any cloud cost anomalies in three simple steps.
Step 1: Analyze your cloud bill for the last month
Take a look at your cloud bill from the last month, and you’ll instantly see why it’s so hard to understand. Cloud providers charge on the basis of various service metrics. For example, some resources in the AWS Simple Storage Service charge by the number of requests, while others use GB.
To make sense of your usage and costs, you must look into various areas in your provider console. You can then group and report on costs by certain attributes - for example, group r…</span>

                              <span>What is AlloyDB?


AlloyDB is a fully managed PostgreSQL compatible database service that Google claims to be twice as fast for transactional workload compared to AWS Aurora PostgreSQL. If you&#x27;ve worked with Google Cloud already, you probably had some contact with CloudSQL for PostgreSQL and Spanner, which offers a PostgreSQL interface. So, what&#x27;s actually new about this AlloyDB?
AlloyDB at the core is the standard PostgreSQL with changes in the kernel to leverage Google Cloud infrastructure at full by disaggregating compute and storage at every layer of the stack. What does it mean? This architecture allows the storage layer to be better equipped to handle changing workloads, more elastic and distributed, fault-tolerant and highly available.

I completed my Hacktoberfest Mission with 4 Pull Request ( 1 accepted and 3 pendings just for a bunch of hours ).
And you? How is it going? ( comment to tell me yours ). 
I would remind you that I&#x27;m partecipating at Hacktoberfest mainly as a maintainer.
My main project, that partecipates for the second year to the Hacktoberfest, is the CXXGraph:

Amazon Lightsail is an easy-to-use cloud platform that provides everything you need to build an app or website with an affordable monthly fee.

Lightsail Containers, announced at re:Invent 2020 , aims to make it easy for you to build container-based apps and websites. To deploy containers in Lightsail, you create a container service that only specifies a few parameters, its performance, and its scope.
AWS manages the compute, network, and traffic management for you. You can deploy up to ten containers in a container service, and one of them can be chosen as the public endpoint. Lightsail provides a secure, load-balanced HTTPS endpoint to access the public endpoint.
You can create a website or app with just a few clicks.

Try it out here
I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback for improvements!
You can customize the gradient background color as well as the gradient color of the circles. You can set the position and the size of the circles as well.
As everything on wweb.dev this tool is under the MIT license. This means that you can use the generated backgrounds for commercial or private projects without attribution.

Enjoyed this tool? Help me grow by sharing it with your friends and colleagues.

                              <span>Suppose that you run a software development agency and you want to enforce a common linting rule set and formatting guidelines for all of your JavaScript projects. You could install ESLint and Prettier in each of your projects. However, your company manages more than a hundred different projects, with custom rules for both ESLint and Prettier. So, if you decide to add or deprecate some rules, you&#x27;ll have to update the rule sets in all of those projects.
A monorepo can help solve this issue. You can put all of your configuration code in a master repository, publish it as an npm package, and then import the npm package into your projects. Next time you want to change the rules, you only need to alter the monorepo project and the change will be reflected in all of your projects, as they&#x27;re dependent on the monorepo project.
If you follow the steps in this tutorial, you’ll see how you can publish NPM packages using Lerna and keep your packages’ code in a monorepo.

                              <span>Method 1 : Using dfn Tag with the title attribute in HTML Document



  
  
  HTML





Dev is a community of software developers getting together to help one another out.

The text(Here Dev) within the dfn tag will be in italic by default.
dfn[title] {
    position: relative;
}
dfn[title]::after {
    content: attr(title);
    position: absolute;
    display: block;
    background-color: #121b22;
    color: #c8cccf;
    font-size: 16px;
    bottom: 100%;
    white-space: nowrap;
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 6px;
    left: 30%;
    transform: scale(0);
    transition: ease-out 300ms;
}
dfn[title]:hover::after {
    transform: scale(1);
}

Method 2 : Using Pseudo Elements ::before or  ::after


We will display a text over the word dev.
Dev is a community of software developers getting together to help one another out.

We will use this sequence -
element --&gt; on hover --&gt; display ::before/::after
#devDescribe:hover::before {
    content: &quot;dev.to&quot;;
    background-color: #ff746b;
    color: #fff;
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 10px;
    padding: 6px 12px;
    border-radius: 6px;
}

And then position your content as per your requirements!
Method 3 : Using the attribute data-* for the element



  
  
  HTML





Dev

a[data-explain] {
    position: relative;
}
a[data-explain]::after {
    content: attr(data-explain);
    position: absolute;
    display: block;
    background-color: #121b22;
    color: #c8cccf;
    font-size: 16px;
    bottom: 100%;
    white-space: nowrap;
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 6px;
    left: 30%;
    transform: scale(0);
    transition: ease-out 300ms;
}
a[data-explain]:hover::after {
    transform: scale(1);
}

                              <span>Introduction


GitHub Actions is the official CI/CD workflow service provided by GitHub. It is aimed at making it easy for open-source project contributors to manage operational maintenance, and enable open-source communities to embrace cloud-native DevOps. GitHub Actions is integrated into most of my open-source projects including Crawlab and ArtiPub. As a contributor, I think GitHub Actions is not only easy to use, but also free (which is the most important). Therefore, I hope this article will allow open-source project contributors who are not familiar with GitHub Actions, to really get ideas on how to utilize it and make an impact.
For those who are not familiar with GitHub Actions, it is strongly recommended that you read the official documentation first, where you can find Introducti…</span>

The Mocker editor itself automatically cuts out people, heads and objects from images. You can also swap backgrounds and add text on the image. That’s basically all the needed functionality to create hilarious mocks 🔥

Some of our ideas:

- Embed emissions data in a consumer finance app, so a company’s sustainability performance shows up next to a stock ticker
- Show carbon footprint next to a product or company listing in a supplier marketplace or sourcing platform
- … you tell us!

We’re excited to hear your ideas on where/how this data could be useful! Please give us feedback.👂

Because the fractional model worked so well at HiddenLevers we decided to try this concept with select beta clients, including Lumiant and Orion, firms familiar to us from our wealth tech days. 

Those initial successes showed us the model could work for growing tech companies. 

TLDR: We&#x27;ve lived the fractional experience + see how it can transform the growth trajectory for a startup looking to take its product to the next level.

I started my automation journey when I adopted Gentoo Linux as my primary operating system in 2002. Twenty years later, automation is not yet a done deal. When I meet with customers and partners, they share automation wins within teams, but they also describe the challenges to achieving similar success at an organizational level.
Most IT organizations have the ability to provision a virtual machine end to end, reducing what used to be a four-week lead time to just five minutes. That level of automation is itself a complex workflow, requiring networking (IP address management, DNS, proxy, networking zones, and so on), identity access management, hypervisor, storage, backup, updating the operatin…</span>

The National Science Foundation (NSF) won’t rebuild the massive Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico following its collapse in late 2020. The agency instead plans to build an education center focused on STEM education and outreach, according to an NSF announcement. 
The Arecibo Observatory was an important tool for deep-space observation and featured in films such as Contact and GoldenEye. But in August 2020, an auxiliary cable fell, with another cable failing in November. The NSF feared that others might have followed, which would have put Arecibo at risk, and said that it planned to demolish the observatory. But before that could happen, Arecibo collapsed in on itself.


The unnamed new center is set to open sometime in 2023. The NSF is...

The letter says that T-Mobile has cut monthly bonuses for T-Force (the carrier’s name for its social media support team), instead replacing them with “micro-raises” and an annual bonus, which the alliance claims there are very few details about.

                              <span>www.celo.tax. Our dev team was spending lots of time building modals for customer payments. We realised there wasn&#x27;t a good tool or api available for integrating non-custodial payments.

This version of Trelis is just the start, and we&#x27;ve a long roadmap of features ahead. Please let us know what to improve and prioritise next! 🙏

                              <span>SavvyCal Workflows go above and beyond custom meeting reminders with the ability to orchestrate multiple actions with your favorite no-code tools and native integrations.

You should be able to focus on the meeting, not the busy work.

Save precious time with every meeting booked. 

Sales demos, customer support calls, podcast recordings, recruiting interviews — enough with the manual tasks!

Here’s where Workflows really shines:
✅ Reuse automations across your links
✅ Orchestrate multiple actions in a single workflow
✅ Meeting reminders automatically adjust for rescheduling and cancellations
✅ Customize meeting reminder messages or get started using a tried-and-true template
✅ Trigger Zapier, Make, or your own custom endpoints at carefully-timed points in the meeting lifecycle

We’ve built everything to make even the most advanced automation pros smile.

Do what you do best and let Workflows do the rest. 😉

Thank you to everyone for your support and patience! We&#x27;re finally dropping the &quot;beta&quot; label and we hope it&#x27;s been worth the wait.

Special credits go to Stephan Ango (@kepano) for the redesign and Liam Cain for tirelessly polishing this release.

                              <span>Firefox OS 复活

Firefox OS 是 Mozilla 在 2013 年创建的安卓替代品，并于 2016 年放弃了它。2018 年，在 Firefox OS 基础上曾出现了一个令人失望的 KaiOS，主要针对功能机市场的商业操作系统，但它是封闭的，还会跟踪用户并且有广告。现在，Capyloon 项目决定复活 Firefox OS，将其带到现代 Linux 智能手机上。该项目还处于早期阶段。它能运行旧的 Firefox OS 应用。目前可以在安卓设备上通过启动谷歌通用系统镜像（GSI）测试其 UI。

老王点评：本来可能成为 Mozilla 的一个基石型项目，非常可惜被放弃了，我认为放弃 Firefox OS 是 Mozilla 的一大败笔。不过，新的复活计划是否能真正复活 Firefox OS，还需要拭目以待，毕竟，时代不同了。




国产编译器项目 LambdaChip 捐赠给 HardenedLinux

开放硬件整体方案 LambdaChip 是为数不多的国产编译器项目，其背后的公司正式破产清算，将其项目改名为 Animula，并正式捐赠给 HardenedLinux 社区。LambdaChip 是一个野心勃勃的国产项目，试图在 10KB 内存的单片机上同时支持 Scheme、Lua 5.2 和 Python3 等语言，已经有了一些不错的进展。HardenedLinux 自嘲其“是否成为商业失败的开源项目的集散地的结论为时尚早”，并对此类项目表示了欢迎。

老王点评：看来 HardenedLinux 成为了一个孤儿项目摇篮。不过，确实需要一些组织来负责照料这些因为种种原因被放弃的项目。




Linux 内核 6.1 放弃火线串口驱动，删除了 4000 行代码

Linux 的 fwserial 驱动程序允许通过 IEEE-1394（火线接口）连接 TTY，以实现对等体之间的有线高速串行连接。但自从该驱动程序在 2012 年被合并以来，没有人负责维护该驱动程序。而且，现在有更好的连接方式，苹果的火线接口越来越没有人使用了。因此，它在 Linux 内核 6.1 中被删除，为内核减少了约 4000 行代码。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：作为一个发展了 30 年的软件项目，其中肯定充斥着大量过时或无用的驱动和代码，因此时不时清理一下也是好的。不过，我觉得或许应该有更明确的规则对内核的各个组成部分设置不同的生命周期。</span>

AI绘画技术发展的简要脉络
GAN时代
在 diffusion 被广泛运用于AI绘画之前，这种艺术形式的主要实现方式 GAN （Generative Adversarial Nets ），以NVlabs的SPADE为例：用户提供草图，由GAN模型将其转化为真实的风景图像。这听起来有点像AI绘画里的img2img，但在这类模型里，用户无法通过文本影响生成结果。

直到类似 CLIP 这种跨模态的图文模型出现，才让用户有办法用文字实现AI作画。后来者如VQGAN+CLIP 或StyleCLIP，均是因为CLIP打通文本和图形域(domain)，用户输入的文本与GAN生成的结果真正有了「可比较性」，这使得计算二者误差并迭代效果成为了可能。

GAN在模拟分布方面有着天然的优势，因此它在人脸属性编辑、风格模仿等领域大放异彩，例如给人戴上墨镜、加上胡子、生成动漫脸、模仿小说风格。也正因如此，它也很容易陷入模型坍缩(Model Collapse)，即…</span>

                              <span>我们大部分人总会身处在一种「身不由己」的状态里，然后内心有一些向往的生活状态，但是现实很残酷，导致自己现在无法去达到目标，于是陷入到了焦虑和无奈的情绪中。
在国庆的节假日里，我见了一个很久未见的朋友。他的孩子已经两岁了，在聊天时，我能感觉到他因为有了孩子后，产生了很大的压力和焦虑。他说，因为有了孩子以后，以往的时间都不由自己来做主了，然后未来所有的计划都变了，已经买好的不错的房子，会因为学区房做改变的计划，然后自己也舍不得消费，想把挣到的钱给孩子准备上。他是一个很负责的人，也希望能多陪孩子，努力工作把孩子养大。但是他觉得自己牺牲了自己看电影、健身，以及和爱人出门旅游的机会，如果要恢复这些，要等孩子长到18岁的成年以后，也就是说，还要等16年。说到这里，他的眼神里露出了一丝无奈。
听到这里，我总觉得哪里不太对，于是产生了一些疑问，面临这样的不由己状态，我们只能无奈或者焦虑？我希望通过这篇文章，呈现出我对这个问题的完整思考，希望你看完后，能够从新的视角去看待自己的问题。
我们不妨先问一个问题：我们为什么讨厌「不由己」的感觉？
答案是：每个人的内心都在追寻某种「自由」。人为什么要追寻自由？其实不仅是人，只要是生物，就会追求自由，追求一种随性地、自然地、丰富地生长。任何人都不希望自己的眼睛永远只盯着一个地方，耳朵只能听见一成不变的音色和音调；不希望身体被禁锢在一个狭小幽闭的空间里不能动弹，不希望思想停止运行，因为当思考停止，就意味着自己不再存在。
自由是人的天性，也可以说，自由是我们不得不接受的权利。
说了那么多自由的不可或缺，那什么才算自由？
一、什么才算自由？
提到自由，我最先想到的是时间和地点的自由。比如做一个旅行 up 主，可以随时出去旅游，想去哪儿就去哪儿，这叫自由。而每天在格子间上班，按照准确的时间上下班打卡，一天里重要的时间都交付给公司和老板，这叫不自由。
这个定义准…</span>

一、问题描述
前段时间碰到一个问题，我 iPhone 背板碎了，需要走 AppleCare 交给苹果返厂维修，而我的 iPhone 是 512GB 的，在备份数据时候麻烦了，我笔记本本身就是 512GB 空间的，肯定不够用呀。
而备份 iPhone 默认的存储位置是在本机的硬盘上，我有个 14T 的硬盘，那么如何将默认的备份位置改到外部存储设备上呢。

二、如何设置备份位置到外部存储器
默认的备份位置在下面这个目录
~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup
其目录是这样的，Backup 里面就是你的每个设备每次的备份记录

我们要做的就是将这个位置映射到你的移动硬盘上去。
1. 确定你的移动硬盘位置
你需要知道自己硬盘的完整文件路径：

打开终端，
输入 cd 然后将你的硬盘图标拖到终端中，就会看到它的路径了
回车进入到移动硬盘目录下，指令 ls -al 能看到硬盘中的所有文件（图片中的 ll 是我自定义的一个指令）
我的就是 /Volumes/Kyle 14TB/ （在终端的路径需要转义空格，所以能看到终端中名字空格前面有个 \）

2. 移动硬盘中新建一个备份文件夹
在你的移动硬盘中新建一个备份文件夹，用于存储接下来的手机备份文件。
mkdir Backup
此时能看到目录中多出一个名为 Backup 的文件夹
 

进入这个文件夹并展示它的绝对路径
cd Backup
pwd
能看到我的这个文件夹的绝对路径是 /Volumes/Kyle 14TB/Backup，这个会在下…</span>

Source code must be compiled in order to run, and in open source software everyone has access to source code. Whether you&#x27;ve written code yourself and you want to compile and run it, or whether you&#x27;ve downloaded somebody&#x27;s project to try it out, it&#x27;s useful to know how to process source code through a compiler, and also what exactly a compiler does with all that code.

Asynchronous programming: Incredibly useful but difficult to learn. You can&#x27;t avoid async programming to create a fast and reactive application. Applications with a high amount of file or network I/O or with a GUI that should always be reactive benefit tremendously from async programming. Tasks can be executed in the background while the user still makes inputs. Async programming is possible in many languages, each with different styles and syntax. Rust is no exception. In Rust, this feature is called async-await.
While async-await has been an integral part of Rust since version 1.39.0, most applications depend on community crates. In Rust, except for a larger binary, async-await comes with zero costs.…</span>

                              <span>Meet 100,000 AI-born people!

• Super realistic yet synthetic humans
• Diverse skin tones, various poses and looks
• 100% worry-free
• Compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and similar regulations
• No likeness rights
• No model releases required

Full-body photos can do much more than just faces. Use them wherever you want: in mockups, ads, games, or other projects. Tell us how you can use them and what you need, and we&#x27;ll put the most wanted features on our roadmap.

What’s inside? 100,000 generated humans as a pack of JPEG pictures with white backgrounds. If you need high-res images with transparent backgrounds or need something special, drop us a message.

Is it really free? Yes. Totally free for non-commercial use as long as you include link attribution back to https://generated.photos/, so that more people can find generated humans. 

What’s next? Different ages, body types, custom clothes and more. So, follow us on Twitter for updates.

                              <span>Brave 是一款出色的类似于 Chrome，但可 替代 Chrome 的网络浏览器。


Firefox 和 Brave 是我喜欢在 Linux 系统上使用的两种浏览器。两者都有不同的优势。

Firefox 比 Brave 做得更好的一件事就是画中画（PIP）模式，它适用于 YouTube、Netflix 和大多数流媒体网站。

Brave 也有画中画模式，但它是如此隐藏，以至于你觉得它根本没有 PIP 支持。

内置画中画适用于某些网站（如 YouTube），但可能不适用于其他网站（如 Prime Video）。不用担心！你可以为此使用专用扩展。

让我在本教程中展示这两种方法。

方法 1：在视频上双击右键

技巧是依次单击两次右键，你应该会看到画中画模式选项。

让我通过一个例子来说明这一点。在 Brave 中播放 YouTube 视频。现在右键单击视频。



再次右键单击。它应该在视频上，但不在上一个上下文菜单上，而在视频的其他地方。

现在你应该看到另一个带有画中画选项的上下文菜单。



选择画中画，视频将从窗口中弹出。你可以将其移动到浏览器中的任何位置。



当你使用其他应用时，你还可以让它在屏幕上的任何位置播放。



在最近的 Brave 版本中，你可以根据自己的喜好调整弹出窗口的大小。

我不明白为什么 Brave 把它隐藏成这样。为什么不突出它？

无论如何，这适用于 YouTube 等网站，但可能不适用于 Prime 视频。如果你愿意，你可以安装一个扩展。

方法 2：使用画中画扩展

谷歌提供了一个官方插件，可让你在谷歌 Chrome 中获得画中画功能。由于 Brave 基于 Chromium，你可以在 Brave 中使用相同的扩展。


画中画扩展


进入扩展页面并点击 “添加到 BraveAdd to Brave” 按钮。



当你单击它时，它会提示添加扩展的选项。



添加扩展后，你应该会在浏览器的右上角看到它。



播放视频时，单击该扩展图标，视频应该会弹出。

你能在 Brave 中启用 PIP 模式吗？

画中画模式已成为休闲流媒体消费的必备功能。我觉得奇怪的是，Brave 和其他浏览器没有足够重视它。 Firefox 处理得很好。

我希望这个快速的小技巧可以帮助你在 Brave 浏览器中获得 PIP 体验。你更喜欢这两种方法中的哪一种？右键单击还是扩展？

基本上，Linux 无处不在，每个人都在谈论它，因此你可能会不自主地陷入到对错失了 “学习 Linux” 的不安中。

所以，你想知道 Linux 的优势是什么，以及它是否值得去学习。

在这篇文章中，我总结了很多 Linux 的优势和劣势。

如果你在选择 Linux 还是你喜欢的操作系统上犹豫不决，我们愿意为你提供一些帮助。


在开始之前，我们要指出的是，“Linux” 本身并不是一个操作系统，它的操作系统被称为 Linux 发行版，而且 Linux 的发行版有数百种。为简单起见，我将其称为 Linux 操作系统，而不是某个特定的 Linux 发行版。可以参考 这篇文章，来更好地理解这些东西。


使用 Linux 的优势

如果你想使用 Linux 替代现在的操作系统，那么只有当你了解 Linux 的优势，才会有意义。

如果 Linux 在你想要它做的事情上表现出色，你将永远都不会后悔你的决定。

不用购买许可证



你需要拥有苹果公司的设备，才能使用 macOS 作为日常使用；你需要拥有 Windows 许可证，才能使用微软的 Windows。

因此，你需要对这些东西进行一定的投资。但是，对于 Linux 呢？它是完全免费的！

与 Windows 和 macOS 相比，不仅仅是操作系统上的不同，Linux 上还有许多免费的软件包。

你无需支付许可证费用，就可以使用所有主流的 Linux 发行版。当然，你可以选择捐赠来支持该…</span>

美国能源科学网络 ESnet6 带宽升至 46Tbps

成立于 1986 年的美国能源科学网络 ESnet，旨在帮助美国能源部的科学家们打通旗下各个实验室，使之能够快速共享大量原始数据。它由横跨全美的 2.4 万公里的专用光缆组成。随着该网络完成 ESnet6 更新，美国最快的互联网带宽也飙升到了 46 Tbps。2021 年的时候，通过 ESnet 网络传输的数据量，就已经达到了惊人的 1.1 EB。不过，在实验性网络中的最高传输速度的记录是日本创造的 1 Pbps，即 1000 Tbps。

新西兰计划对农场动物打嗝、撒尿征税

据央视新闻，新西兰政府 11 日提议对农场动物打嗝、撒尿排放的温室气体征税，以应对气候变化。新西兰政府表示，该项税收是世界首创，将从 2025 年开始征收，税价未定。新西兰约一半的温室气体排放来自农场，包括牛打嗝产生的甲烷和尿液中所含的一氧化二氮。此前，新西兰政府 2003 年提出征收农场动物的“放屁税”计划，遭到农场主反对，最终告吹。

                              <span>更新 Linux 系统并没有那么复杂，不是吗？毕竟，要更新 Ubuntu 之类的发行版，你只需要使用 apt update 和 apt upgrade 就行。

如果所有的包都是通过一个包管理器安装的，就会是这样。

但现在情况不再如此。你有经典的 apt/dnf/pacman，还有 Snap、Flatpak、Appimages。不止于此，你还可以使用 PIP（用于 Python）和 Cargo（用于 Rust）安装应用。

使用 Node？ NPM 包需要单独更新。Oh My Zsh？需要单独更新。Vim 中的插件、Atom 等也可能不被 apt/dnf/pacman 覆盖。

你现在看到问题了吗？这就是名为 Topgrade 的新工具旨在解决的问题。

Topgrade：处理各种更新的单一程序

Topgrade 是一个 CLI 程序，它会检测你使用的工具，然后运行适当的命令来更新它们。



除了通常的 Linux 包管理器，它还可以检测和更新 Brew、Cargo、PIP、Pihole、Vim 和 Emacs 插件、R 软件包等。你可以在 维基页面 上查看支持的包列表。

Topgrade 的主要特点：


能够更新来自不同的包管理器的软件包，包括固件！

你可以如何控制更新包。

高度可定制。

甚至能够在更新包之前进行概览。


所以不要浪费任何时间，让我们跳到安装。

使用 Cargo 在 Linux 中安装 Topgrade

安装过程非常简单，因为我将使用 Cargo 包管理器。

我们已经有了 详细指南，其中包含设置 Cargo 包管理器的多种方法。所以我将在我的示例中使用 Ubuntu 来快速完成。

因此，让我们以最少方式安装依赖项以及 Cargo：

sudo apt install cargo libssl-dev pkg-config


安装 Cargo 后，使用给定的命令安装 Topgrade：

cargo install topgrade


它会抛出一个警告：



你只需添加 cargo 路径即可运行二进制文件。这可以通过给定的命令来完成，你需要使用你的用户名替换 sagar：

echo &#x27;export PATH&#x3D;$PATH:/home/sagar/.cargo/bin&#x27; &gt;&gt; /home/sagar/.bashrc


现在，重启系统，Topgrade 就可以使用了。但是等等，我们需要安装另一个包来更新 Cargo 以获取最新的包。

cargo install cargo-update


这样我们完成了安装。

使用 Topgrade

使用 Topgrade 非常简单。使用一个命令，就是这样：

topgrade





但这不会给你除了系统包之外的任何控制，但正如我所提到的，你可以将不想更新的仓库列入黑名单。

从 Topgrade 中排除包管理器和仓库

假设我想排除 Snap 和从默认包管理器下载的包，所以我的命令是：

topgrade --disable snap system




要进行永久更改，你必须在其配置文件中进行一些更改，这些更改可以通过给定的命令访问：

topgrade --edit-config


对于此示例，我排除了 Snap 和默认系统仓库：



试运行 Topgrade

评估将要更新的过时软件包总是一个好主意，我从 Topgrade 的整个目录中找到了这个最有用的选项。

你只需使用带有 -n 选项的 topgrade 命令，它就会生成过期软件包的摘要。

topgrade -n




检查需要更新的软件包的一种简洁方法。

总结

在使用 Topgrade 几周后，它成为了我的 Linux 武器库中不可或缺的一部分。 像大多数其他 Linux 用户一样，我只是通过我的默认包管理器更新包。 Python 和 Rust 包被完全忽略了。 感谢 Topgrade，我的系统现在完全更新了。

我知道这不是每个人都想使用的工具。那你呢？愿意试一试吗？

                              <span>通过参与两个令人兴奋的新项目来庆祝开放组织社区的六周年。




2021 年 6 月 2 日，开放组织Open Organization社区庆祝其成立六周年。这是六年来（上百篇的）文章、（一系列的）书籍、（具有启发性的）对话、（我们所 喜欢的）教学和学习。我们非常自豪地成为一个充满活力的开放专家和领导者的社区，致力于将 开放原则 带到大大小小的组织。事实上，许多 开放组织大使Open Organization Ambassadors 以帮助他人变得更加开放为职业，我们的社区仍然致力于帮助各行业的领导者以开放的心态和行为融入他们的社区和环境中。

去年 是开放组织项目的一个 成长 和 发展 时期。今年，我们将在这一势头的基础上继续努力。今天，我们很自豪地介绍两项新的倡议——当然，也邀请你的参加。

开启，调整，开放

首先，我们很高兴地宣布：我们社区的工作有了一个全新的场所。OpenOrgTV。这不仅仅是一个新的平台。它也是另一种媒介的实验：视频。

在我们的频道上，我们将举办各种对话 —— 从深层次的书评到社区圆桌会议。首先，请查看“开放领导力对话Open Leadership Conversations”系列，其中包括对某些富有洞察力的领导者的采访，提供他们对根据开放原则进行领导的意义的观点。或者观看我们的 Q&amp;A 式写作节目 “问大使Ask the Ambassadors”，由社区专家回答你关于组织文化和设计的问题。也想参与这个节目吗？在我们的 新的专门的论坛 中向社区成员提交你的问题。

整个月，我们都会介绍 开放组织大使Open Organization Ambassadors，让你终于可以看到他们的面孔，并听到你多年来阅读的故事、案例研究和采访背后的声音。

                              <span>PostgreSQL 是最灵活的数据库之一，并且它是开源的。


数据库是以一种有组织且灵活的方式存储信息的工具。电子表格在本质上就是一个数据库，但是图形化应用程序这一限制使得大多数的电子表格应用程序对程序员毫无用处。随着 边缘计算 和物联网设备成为重要的平台，开发者们需要更有效且轻量级的方法，来存储、处理、查询大量的数据。我最爱的一种组合是使用 Lua 连接 ostgreSQL 数据库。无论你使用什么编程语言，PostgreSQL 一定是数据库的绝佳选择，但是在使用 PostgreSQL 之前，首先你需要知道一些基本的东西。

安装 PostgreSQL

在 Linux 上安装 PostgreSQL，要使用你的软件库。在 Fedora，CentOS，Megeia 等类似的 Linux 版本上使用命令：

$ sudo dnf install postgresql postgresql-server


在 Debian， Linux Mint， Elementary 等类似的 Linux 版本上使用命令：

$ sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib


在 macOs 和 Windows 上，可以从官网 postgresql.org 下载安装包。

配置 PostgreSQL

大多数发行版安装 PostgreSQL 数据库时没有启动它，但是为你提供了一个脚本或 systemd 服务，能够可靠地启动 PostgreSQL。但是，在启动 PostgreSQL 之前，必须创建一个数据库集群。

Fedora

在 Fedora，CentOS 等类似的版本上，PostgreSQL 安装包中提供了一个 PostgreSQL 配置脚本。运行这个脚本，可以进行简单地配置：

                              <span>现今社会高速发展，充满了不确定性。我们置身于时代的洪流中，被裹挟着不知冲向何处。诚然，时代给了我们更多的选择，同时也让我们更加迷茫，仿佛处在一个有无数岔路的迷宫里，不知道自己将走向何方。
「如何在不确定的风浪里，实现确定性的成长？」这应该是现今大多人所关注的问题吧。
关于成长，市面上有很多方法论，但它往往都不讲背后的原理。不知道大家是否也和我一样，看到一些方法或者教程，经常会收藏起来，跟练一段时间，但大多都是半途而废，坚持一阵子后又打回原形了。
为什么会这样呢？因为每个人的情况不同，适用的方法也不同。如果只是知其然不知其所以然，那只有不断地尝试各种方法，不断地去磨合，才能找到适合自身的。这个尝试的过程，其实就是通过外界的方法，来获得自身的反馈，从而更了解自己。
但如果我们换个角度，一开始就从了解自己出发，再剖析方法背后的原理，那是不是更容易找到适合自己的方法呢？所以我认为，知其然又知其所以然，反倒是一条捷径。
要了解自己，就得先知道我们的心智是怎么运作的。所谓「心智」，就像是大脑里一个可以不断升级的系统，包含了我们对外部世界的所有认知，也包括因此所造就的思维方式。我们的认知和感觉，其实也只是心智对外部世界的投射而已。
前不久出版的一本新书——《打开心智》，正是围绕「心智」这个概念展开的。兵书有云，「知己知彼，百战不殆」。书中先是阐述了大脑的四个基本原理，帮助我们了解心智是怎么运作的，此为「知己」；然后又围绕情绪、习惯、动力、学习、思考和创造等方面，剖析背后的原理，此为「知彼」。不仅如此，它还提供一套行之有效的方法，让我们能更好地实现自己的目标。所以，这是一本帮助我们认识自我、突破自我的书籍，知己知彼，我们才能更有效实现自我成长，去应对时代的不确定性。

                              <span>前言
本教程源于 @yetone 的一篇 推文 ，和 @Jack Huang 讨论后稍作修改。
苹果自带的翻译功能在几次版本更新之后已很好用，但需要多个步骤，对专业词汇的支持也没有欧陆词典好（欧陆词典可自行扩充词库）。本教程基于 iOS 自带的 Back Tap 功能，快速启动翻译软件，并支持截图 OCR 翻译。
前期准备
下载软件： 欧路词典 (Eudic) 和快捷指令 (Shortcuts)
「欧路词典」，是一款经典的翻译软件，可自行扩充词库，专业版需付费。
「快捷指令」是苹果官方的软件，前身是 Workflow Gallery，可以理解成一个无代码开发平台（No-Code Development Platform），不需要编程知识，就能完成很多自动化功能的实现。如果对这方面感兴趣，可访问 Shortcuts Gallery 。
安装 Shortcuts
在 Safari 中打开以下两个链接，点击「获取捷径」，再点击「添加快捷方式」。
Clipboard Translate: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b643ecb89dbd4468b8679cd4888b13d9
Image Translate: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/02bf2bb484a54f50897b8a3f315d48fd
设置快捷方式
点击「设置」- 辅助功能 – 触控 – 轻点背面（Back Tap）- 设置如图所示：

使用
Clipboard Translate：轻点手机背面两次，自动读取「剪切板」中的文本，并跳转欧路词典翻译。
Image Translate: 轻点手机背面三次，自动截屏，并识别图片中的文本，跳转欧路词典翻译。
扩展：

上文是通过 Back Tap 实现的，日常使用中偶尔会有误触的可能，也可以通过「辅助触控」，俗称「小白点」实现。
macOS 上的全文翻译可参考这篇文章：一种几乎永不失效的网页中英对照翻译方案</span>

                              <span>当我第一次接触「断舍离」这个概念的时候，不仅对它描绘的图景所震撼，而且深切认为这就是我想要的生活。于是我在家里翻箱倒柜的搜索可以丢弃物品，从没用的数据线到大件的废纸箱，只要是能扔的我都直接从家中扔了出去。
也许是一次性丢弃的东西过多，还没等到我开始审视剩下的东西要不要留下，家中有些东西就已经告急了，无奈又开始了买买买的旅程。当我检查购物订单，发现其中含有已经丢弃的物品，我才意识到出现了问题。例如有一次，我需要同时充电多个设备，需要多根数据线，但为了实现「断舍离」，只保留了一根。那时我发现，很多我所丢弃的东西不是不需要的，而是在扔东西那一刻我认为不需要。
仔细想想，这种丢完东西后，又重新买的行为不正是商家所乐意看到的吗？把这种观念作为生活的准则似乎是从另一个方面掉入了消费主义的陷阱。为此我重新审视、省察了「断舍离」这个概念和我所想象的生活，并重新制定了一套可行、节俭的规则。
谨慎购买物品
谨慎购买物品应该是我认为最能体现「断舍离」后生活的方法了。毕竟，我希望看到的是一个没有过多杂物和没用物品的家。既然我无法将所有东西都丢弃，那么就控制新增物品的数量。先对已有物品尽可能收纳，让空间看起来不那么杂乱，再对每个想买的东西进行衡量，如果不是必须的，那就对它说不。
当然，谨慎购买物品也要购买物品。例如：平时生活需要用的牙膏、毛巾等必需品直接买就可以了，买时尽可能货比三家，选择合适的价格和种类。真正应该谨慎购买的是那些看起来有大用，但实际到手可能不会使用的东西。
这里可以分享几个我自己的衡量方法作为参考：
谨慎购买「美好生活」
例如，当我在网上看到了一个洗碗机的广告，它不断的宣传购买洗碗机后解放双手的美好。如果按照宣传所描述的，我是可以购买后有更多的时间去干其他的事情。然而，我回顾日常生活后发现我平时并没有洗大量碗的需求，也就是说，在没看到这个广告前我是不会想象到它所描绘的「美好生活」，…</span>

设想这样一个情况吧：
你带着愉快的心情到了一个地方度假，结果在度假期间遭遇新毒株的新冠疫情爆发，全城宣布静默，城市道路、公共交通和出港港口全部封闭或停运。在配合社区每天的核酸检测和居家不出门同时，你也在仔细留意当地发布的相关信息 —— 十分幸运的是，尽管此刻的疫情还很严重，但当地已经宣布恢复机场运行，你似乎看到了一丝曙光，决定购买机票离开。
然而，事情似乎并没有你想象的这么简单。从恢复机场的商业化运行之后，到你真正坐上飞机离开这里的时间，却过去了一个月。那么这一个月里，到底发生了什么？

我和朋友在今年的 7 月 16 日回到三亚，开始为期一个月的旅居生活。然而半个月后，一起从崖州区爆发的境外输入疫情在短短几天内就席卷了整个三亚，然后迅速波及了整个海南岛内。受到疫情的影响，我和朋友只能决定提前结束旅居，在 8 月 5 日的晚上购买了 8 月 9 日从海口回广州的火车票，并决定在 8 月 6 日一早坐环岛高铁前往海口。
但计划总是赶不上变化。就在 8 月 6 日的凌晨 3 点 52 分，三亚发布发出通知，宣布全域进入静默状态。

自 2022 年 8 月 6 日凌晨 6 时起，全市实行临时性全域静态管理，除保障社会基本运行服务、疫情防控和紧急特殊情况外，全市范围限制人员流动，暂停城市公共交通。恢复时间另行通告。

好在 8 月 15 日之后，三亚宣布有序恢复凤凰国际机场国内客运航班商业化运行。这意味着，只要是符合…</span>

                              <span>平时工作中往往会遇到新的知识点，这个时候需要我们快速学习并且进行最佳实践。往往是在真正学习了一段时间之后，才会发现有哪些地方可以优化，这样磨合出来的工作流才是最适合自己的。经过两年工作之余的学习后，我磨合出了以下学习工作流：

底层核心逻辑
一开始我学习新知识时会参考一些博客或者是视频，当我开始敲代码实践时往往会出现一些纰漏和错误，我开始意识到我参考的信息可能是错误的，毕竟发博客的门槛低，因此文章的可信度可能不高，于是我开始查阅一些相关的中文书籍。
中文书籍的确是比较全面且系统地讲解了知识点，但众所周知，技术更迭很迅速，又因为老美在 CS 方面一直都是灯塔，所以一般中文书籍里的内容会滞后于当前最新的知识，导致我跟着中文书籍实践会出现软件版本差异的问题。这时我开始意识到一手信息的重要性，有些中文书籍是翻译英文书籍的，一般翻译一本书也要一两年，这会导致信息传递的延迟，还有就是翻译的过程中信息会有损失。如果一本中文书籍不是翻译的呢，那么它肯定也是参考其他书籍的，参考的过程会带有对英文原著中语言和语义理解的偏差。
于是我就顺其自然地开始翻阅英文书籍。不得不说，整体英文书籍内容的质量是比中文书籍高的，一个原因是写英文书籍的作者更会写作，他们会用自己的话很详尽地解释一个知识点，而不是像一些中文书籍那样罗列知识点并且理所当然地以为读者能读懂而忽略一些细节的描述，还有一个原因就是知识很注重时效性，英文书籍的内容往往更新一点。后来随着学习的层层深入，以知识的时效性和完整性出发，我发现 源代码 &gt; 官方文档 &gt; 英文书籍 &gt; 英文博客，最后我得出了一张 信息损失图

虽然一手信息很重要，但后面的 N 手信息并非一无是处，往往这 N 手资料里写了作者对源知识的转化——作者对知识基于某种逻辑的梳理（流程图、思维导图等）以及自己的一些理解（对源知识的抽象、类比、延伸到其他知识点），这些转化可以帮助我…</span>

                              <span>如果说苹果发布会是每年一度的春晚，微信的间歇性更新就像不期而至的假期。在过去的十一年间，微信逐步从最初的简单样子一步步变迁为现在承载了许多功能和期待的国民软件。
而我作为一个非极客普通用户，在翻看朋友圈时蓦然发现这款软件自己也已经不知不觉得用了九年，发布了无数朋友圈内容和加入了许许多多的群聊。自己也从一个微信聊天使用者变成了公众号重度用户和创作者。不妨总结下过去这些年我是如何一步步从抗拒到全面使用微信的以及它带给了我日常生活哪些改变。
面朝屏幕的对话
毫无疑问，所有微信用户使用频率最高的一定是微信的基本功能：聊天。一对一或一对多，文字或语音。每个人都习惯了面对着屏幕表达自己。
加个微信
随着微信的普及，几乎没有朋友没有微信，以至于“加个微信”变成一个礼貌性和建立连接的标准动作。
我一开始并不理解为何微信会拿下偌大的市场，但过年回到老家后看到那么多中老年非QQ用户拿着微信发语音消息时，我才意识到它极大得拓宽了用户群体：“按住说话，松开发送” 简洁而易用。即便是我自己并不喜欢对面突如其来的数个60秒语音（希望微信语音能像子弹短信那样实现可以自动转为文字或者暂停播放的语音管理），但毕竟使用门槛大大降低了，而且简洁爽气的操作界面远远超过了当时花里胡哨的QQ。
所以几乎国内智能手机用户人均一个微信号时，加个微信，犹如一个登门入户的邀请，使得物理分离开之后，依旧保持了进一步交流的可能性，既有的情感更容易维系或加深。
当我们都拥有了一个便宜而高清的通讯渠道时，高昂的运营商资费带来的束缚瞬间被打破，许多亲人和朋友的联系变得频繁。当某个中秋和朋友们打着微信视频“云喝酒”，一起庆祝花好月圆夜时突然觉得科技的进步真好。如果哪一天能够启用Callkit（即像接听电话一样接听），微信电话或视频的体验应该会更好。
遇见陌生人
刚刚开始使用微信时的的朋友大多是熟人，群聊大多是家庭群，工作群，同学群。之后…</span>

Tech is everywhere! And it&#x27;s important to remember, everyone is a beginner once. The industry is continually growing, looking for new folks to add valuable perspectives. How do we inspire our next batch of tech contributors?
In honor of Ada Lovelace Day, we asked our community of writers if they had any resources or books they recommend for young programmers or enthusiasts. Here&#x27;s what they had to share.

Lately, I&#x27;ve been looking at how Groovy streamlines the slight clunkiness of Java. This article examines some differences between connecting to a PostgreSQL database using JDBC in Java versus Groovy.
Install Java and Groovy
Groovy is based on Java and requires a Java installation. Both a recent/decent version of Java and Groovy might be in your Linux distribution&#x27;s repositories, or you can install Groovy by following these instructions. A nice alternative for Linux users is SDKMan, which provides multiple versions of Java, Groovy, and many other related tools. For this article, I&#x27;m using SDK&#x27;s releases of:
Java version 11.0.12-open of OpenJDK 11
Groovy version 3.0.8

                              <span>前段时间清理电脑，发现「坚果云」在电脑上缓存了 50GB 平时用不上的文件。在与技术人员沟通后，被告知自从 M1 芯片发布以来，「云桥模式」的接口就无法使用，缓存只能手动清理。于是萌生了自己搭建一个 NAS 服务器的想法。
什么是NAS

NAS (Network Attached Storage：网络附属存储) 是一种连接您家中或办公室网路的智慧储存装置。您可以将家人或同事的重要文件、珍贵的相片、影音收藏等档案储存于 NAS，仅需透过网页浏览器或手机应用程式，即可轻松存取档案并享有 NAS 提供的丰富服务。

NAS 也可以简单理解为：「不限速的个性化本地网盘」。
不知道你在日常生活中是否遇到过以下的情形：

电脑的储存空间不够用，想要使用文件，但不想把所有文件存在本地；
存在百度云盘的文件或视频，下载速度仅有 69KB/s；
急需从 OneDrive 下载一个文件，却发现 OneDrive 无法打开；
迅雷下载影片，进度超过 98% 之后下载速度只有 5KB/s；
无处安放的照片存在云相册，画质受到不可逆损伤；
MAC 内建备份功能「时间机器」无处备份个人数据；
无法忍受互联网大厂的隐私乱象；
团队协作交互讨论、修改、审批效率太低，大文件传输困难；

如果你在生活中遇到过以上痛点，这篇文章或许会给你提供一个解决思路。
如何选购 NAS
目前的 NAS 市场基本被群晖和威联通垄断，即便是采用 DIY 方案，也还是要使用黑群晖或黑威联通的系统（即破解版系统）。本文以本土化更好些的群晖NAS（Synology NAS）为例，介绍如何选购家用 NAS。

「双核和四核」表示可以同时运行的程序数量。
「2GB内存」代表程序运行的速度，部分型号可以进行扩展。但要注意，部分…</span>

我是特斯拉 Model 3 的用户，个人觉得特斯拉在大陆的导航和娱乐系统确实不太好用，当然可能也和我日常喜欢用高德导航、Spotify 听歌这些比较多有关系。相信很多特斯拉的用户也和我一样，非常希望能用上苹果的 CarPlay，但特斯拉的车机系统其实是 Linux 并且非常封闭，目前也不太存在破解和安装软件这种捷径的可能。
特斯拉 CarPlay
不过波兰的开发者 Michał Gapiński 前段时间给出了一个用树莓派的解决方法，实现了在特斯拉上使用 CarPlay。因为之前一直需要的两块树莓派的开发板，直到最近简化到了一个并且也简单稳定了不少，我也就做个教程和大家分享下。
准备工作
需要说一下，树莓派 4B 目前的价格依然比较高，整个过程也稍微有点麻烦，折腾的乐趣大于实际使用的意义，不太建议特意为这个去买树莓派，也不太建议不熟悉刷机的朋友尝试。
为了实现在特斯拉上使用 CarPlay 的效果，你需要准备：

树莓派 4B 开发板（需包含 SD 卡和读卡器）
HDMI 转 CSI-2 转接板
Micro HDMI to HDMI 连接线
车连易的 CarPlay 盒子
USB Type-C 数据线（用于刷机以及连接车供电）
一台电脑（用于给树莓派安装系统 Win Mac 都可以）
下载好系统 （版本：2022.38.1)

当然有些是可选的：比如树莓派的外壳和散热风扇，推荐选择塑料的外壳，因为金属的可能会屏蔽树莓派的 Wi-Fi 信号；如果想让特斯拉连接到树莓派的 Wi-Fi 的时候还能使用网络，则需要再购买一个 USB 4G…</span>

                              <span>我的第一部手机是在去外地上初中时，从我妈那里淘汰下来的诺基亚 3100，之后是高中时用的诺基亚 5320XM。读中学时移动互联网才初露头角，5320XM 用 100 MB 流量的 EDGE 网套餐承载了我躲在宿舍床上的摸鱼时光，按键的漆也在一条条聊天短信里被磨掉。当时我的所有朋友都在用全拼打字，而我为了提高速度，把手指挪动更少的笔划输入法练得飞快。

后来我换了 Android 机器，在还有不少想去把玩的手机没试过时，迎来了 Symbian 与诺基亚的衰落，送走了滑盖、旋盖、全键盘。移动互联网改变了我们使用手机的习惯，也同样改变手机的形态——所以当我发现还有厂商在出实体数字键盘的智能机时，就一直想找个机会试试。赶上多亲 F22 Pro 新品发布，我付了款，等过了两周的疫情，终于把它拿到了手。
这份喜悦在到手的一小时内烟消云散。

青涩但合格的硬件设计
多亲 F22 Pro 的设计和前代的 F21 Pro 其实有很多不同。
除了处理器从 MT6761 / 虎贲 T310 一下跃升到 MTK G85 以外（虽然还是挺弱的），比较显眼的就是尺寸变化。屏幕从此前的 2.8 英寸 480*640 升级到了 3.5 英寸 640*960，这样的参数现在看来可能并不出色，但它和 iPhone 4 的那块 Retina 细腻程度其实一致，文字显示效果不错。而且由于用了几天只有三英寸的 Jelly 2，这块屏幕甚至让我有种换上大屏手机的错觉。

机身和之前的多亲手机一致，依然是与功能机一样的瘦长手感，再加上与 iPhone 4 一样的屏幕和圆形的导航键，整个手机颇有一种当年 iPhone 配上 Typo 键盘壳的感觉。手机的宽度也因为屏幕增大从 53 mm 扩展到 58 mm，和现在流行的尺寸相比，仍然很容易上手。
按键方面，F22 Pro 抛弃了上代采用的孤岛式按键，转向了一体式的按键设计…</span>

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become more prevalent in our daily lives. While AI systems may intend to offer users convenience, there have been numerous examples of automated tools getting it wrong, resulting in serious consequences. What&#x27;s happening in the AI system that leads to erroneous and harmful conclusions? Probably a dramatic combo of bad AI combined with a lack of human oversight. How do we as a society prevent AI ethics fails?
The open source community has had, for well over 20 years, clear processes for dealing with errors (&quot;bugs&quot;) in software. The Open Source Definition firmly establishes the rights of developers and the rights of users. There are frameworks, licenses, and…</span>

                              <span>我在硅谷科技大厂工作，自20年初疫情爆发至今居家办公已有2年半。在此期间，为应对远程办公而打造的软件、平台、工具雨后春笋般涌现而发展壮大，工作中的沟通协同方式乃至绩效考核机制也随之发生了深刻的改变。相信如此大规模且持续的远程办公潮流在人类工业发展史上都是头一次，而这种趋势还将继续延续下去。
这股远程办公的潮流和趋势，对于身处其间的打工仔而言又有怎样的影响呢？首先要强调的是，远程办公也许并不适用于所有行业(至少在现阶段)，居家远程办公也未必适合所有人。
以我个人的经历而言，我的小孩在此期间出生现都已2岁有余，除此之外我还经历了买房升职。似乎远程办公的工作形式并没有对我的人生重要节点造成什么特别的影响。然而回过头来看又不能不承认，我的生活作息、社交活动与工作方式都已发生积极正面的改变。
居家办公始末
20年初，随着疫情的爆发和公司对于员工健康的关注，硅谷的科技公司陆续允许员工在家远程办公。除去极少数公司在初期就允诺疫情结束之后员工可以继续远程工作，绝大多数的公司还是给出了一个返回办公室的预定时间目标。不过由于漂亮国防疫政策的拉垮，这个预定时间不断地被推迟。直到疫苗的大规模铺开，最终在今年的5月前后，各大公司开始号召员工返回办公室。
2年多的远程办公已经深刻地改变了人们的生活方式：有人已经离开房价高企的硅谷或大都市搬迁到物价更低的偏远地区，有人因为家中有高危人群（老人或小孩）而不愿意回到办公司暴露在潜在的感染风险之中，有人单纯习惯了不用上下班通勤的生活而不再愿意花费时间去办公室。把四散各地的员工“驱赶”回办公室并非可一蹴而就。有感于此，大多数“开明”的公司都发布了混合办公的政策，即一周可以有若干个工作日在家办公（其余工作日仍然需要回到办公室）；又或者开放了永久远程办公的申请，为铁了心不回办公室的员工打开一个通道。某种程度而言，全员远程办公这件事情，已经在今年夏天结束。

最近需要给长辈置换一下手机，在有限的预算内，经过多次比较发现还是小米的硬件配置更好一些，最后也是下单了小米。
在 2022 年，Android 系统对手机权限的进一步限制，一些过往的卡顿问题都得到了一定的解决。但是在国内的定制版 Android 机上，和原生 Android 系统还是多了一些特色的东西：

无处不在的系统级广告，诱导用户点击/误触，从而去跳转/下载 APP
“不小心下载” 的 APP，占用宝贵的内存/硬盘资源，拖慢手机速度
国内特色的航母级 APP，一个 APP 占几个 G 的硬盘，有些小而美的应用甚至几十个 G

上面的三个问题中，前两个可以通过一定的努力解决大部分，第三个大家都没得选只能硬抗。本文就是聚焦于「关闭 MIUI 无处不在的广告」这个话题的。

虽然 MIUI 一直有 ADUI 的称呼，但是个人身处这个行业也能表示理解：
小米把硬件上的利润压到了最低，赚不到钱就要从其他路子上想办法，只能不停的“加点儿广告怎么了”

废话不多说，我们直接开始。

本文成文于 2022.09，使用的是 MIUI 13.0.4 版本，随着时间的推移，其它版本 MIUI 可能有操作不一致的情况，这点需要读者注意。

一、通过常规手段关闭广告推送
1.1 关闭系统广告
MIUI 的许多内置应用（例如 天气、万年历、音乐）和系统级页面（例如桌面文件夹）上都会推送一些贴片广告，诱导用户观看和点击。
可能用户反馈过于激烈，2019 年年末某个版本更新中，新增了「一键关闭系统广告」的功能。这个开关也很好找，我们直接进入「设置」，然后在搜索框里输入「系统广告」，然后点击进入新页面，把「系统工具广告」这个开关关上即可。

                              <span>相信对于很多小伙伴来说，Twitter并非单纯是一个“社交”平台，而是“信息获取”平台。通过追踪各类名人、机构的账号来了解所关注领域的最新动向。比如最近火热的NFT、Web3.0社区中就有大量的意见领袖在Twitter发声。
然而从获取信息效率的视角来看，常规Twitter浏览界面并不是特别友好，时间线上有着各类广告，同时经常用着用着就发现自己迷失在几十个选项卡和搜索结果页中。如果你遇到过类似问题，并希望提高在Twitter获取信息的效率，我会强烈推荐Tweetdeck这个功能。
Tweetdeck是Twitter官方提供的在线工具，有模块化，高度自定义化的浏览界面，不仅适合专业的Twitter运营人员工作使用，也非常适合个人用户来改造优化自己的信息时间线。通过对比图片，可以很清楚的看到两种模式的差异。Tweetdeck可以在设置中选择 黑/白 两种显示模式，我个人更喜欢黑暗模式，看起来更轻松。
4K显示器下的twitter常规界面，大量留白非常浪费空间4K显示器下的tweetdeck界面
 
基础介绍
Tweetdeck和常规界面相比最重要的功能主要是3点：自动刷新、多列显示和自定义模块。自动刷新不需要过多解释，节省频繁刷新的操作和时间。自定义模块可以定制每一列种显示的内容，例如：

我想单独查看Elon Musk的所有推特或者他直发的内容。 - 单用户模式
我希望把多个账号归为一个主题，单独浏览，如：NBA球星们、实时股市新闻、NFT相关资讯。 - 清单模式
我想追踪网友对正在发生的热点事件的评论，如：WWDC大会、俄乌冲突事件等 - 搜索模式

多列显示则大幅度提升了屏幕利用率，让我们可以同时间追踪上述这些不同的主题。

上图是我最近使用Tweetdeck的截图，我通过Vivaldi浏览器“垂直平铺”功能在右边放置了Tesla AI Day的视频直播，在左边放置了Tweetdeck，并添加了：“tesla ai day”搜索结果列、“tesla bot”搜索结果列、Elon的个人内容列，和常用的市场资讯列。
 
模块选择
在Tweetdeck中，可以选择添加多种不同的模块，其中包含，
内容类模块：单用户模式、搜索模式、清单模式、正在流行内容等
功能类模块：通知、站内信、@我的、已预约内容等
我并没有做账户运营的需求，因此最常使用的还是：搜索结果、单个用户、多用户清单这几个内容类模块。
可添加模块截图
 
搜索模式：
显示关键词搜索结果配合自动刷新功能，达成“直播”的效果。并且可以通过设置条件对搜索结果进一步筛选，可设置条件包含：

按推文类型过滤：例如包含图片、视频、GIF等的推文；或者是否显示“转发”内容。
筛选内容的发布时间范围，最小单位可以精确到半个小时。
按照推文语言类型筛选，例如：中文、英文、日语等。
筛选推文发布者：选择特定的单个用户或者一组用户的搜索结果。
内容互动情况：显示至少有多少点赞、转发或评论的内容。

 
单用户模式 &amp; 多用户清单：
这2个模式本质差别就是关注用户的多少，选定关注范围后的筛选条件选项完全一致。在这2个模块中，同样可以通过设置筛选条件，包含：

按推文类型过滤：例如包含图片、视频、GIF等的推文；或者是否显示“转发”内容。
关键词过滤：显示或排除包含指定关键词的内容。
用户筛选：由指定用户发布的内容 或 @特定用户的内容。

在Tweetdeck追踪的，不管是单用户还是清单，并不要求是关注的账户。这点非常贴心，也帮助我区分不同使用场景，我把大量“新闻资讯”类账号从关注列表中去除，放在Tweetdeck清单中，日常在手机上浏览就不会被刷屏，而更关注轻松的内容，坐在电脑前则可以追踪查看这些庞杂的资讯。
在Tweetdeck创建的清单可以选择设置为公开或者私有列表，同时这个列表也会同步到常规界面左侧的列表按钮中。

 
模块设置：
这几个内容模块中都可以单独设置“媒体展示尺寸大小”，可以大体理解为模块中每一条内容的高度。以及是否通过“声音”或者“桌面通知”的形式发送通知，提示关注的内容有更新。

Tweetdeck是简单，但又很强大的工具，给我带来了很多的便利，也希望分享给大家，打造适合自己的内容模块。
 
PS：
Tweetdeck访问地址：https://tweetdeck.twitter.com
今年Twitter官方下架了Tweetdeck的桌面客户端软件，仅提供网页版本，如果想在电脑上安装独立客户端可以使用Tweeten，有Windows和Mac版本，并且基于Tweetdeck提供了更多的功能。

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol based on SSLv3 designed to encrypt and decrypt traffic between two sites. In other words, TLS ensures that you&#x27;re visiting the site you meant to visit and prevents anyone between you and the website from seeing the data being passed back and forth. This is achieved through the mutual exchange of digital certificates: a private one that exists on the web server, and a public one typically distributed with web browsers.
In production environments, all servers run securely, but server certificates may expire after some period. It is then the server&#x27;s responsibility to validate, regenerate, and reuse newly genera…</span>

@甜食：神藤毛巾内毛圈浴巾

入手渠道：淘宝
入手价格：370 元

最近因为搬家，许多生活用品需要重新购买，其中自然也包括各类卫浴洗漱用品这种又占空间、单价又便宜，导致搬走不如买新的的物件。在物色新浴巾的时候，我发现了神藤毛巾这个品牌。神藤毛巾是日本大阪的毛巾品牌，有别于传统的毛圈表面的毛巾，他们的产品以棉纱材质的毛巾见长。
传统毛巾的毛圈材质表面积更大，用来清洁自然是效率更高的，不过生活在南方的读者应该多少都会有潮湿天气下毛巾连日难以风干，甚至产生异味的经验，神藤的毛巾采用了多层纱布的织法，既保证了良好的吸水性，疏松的质地也让毛巾更加速干，同时比较平滑的表面也提供了更清爽的触感。
我最终购买的这款产品叫作 Inner Pile，算是神藤毛巾比较创新的一款产品（和很多刻板印象中的日本作坊式品牌一样，他们总共只有三款产品 —— 另外两款是多层棉纱毛巾「2.5-PLY GAUZE」和传统的毛圈毛巾「YUKINE」，具体用途只通过尺寸来区分），由外层的两层纱布夹着中间的一层毛圈构成。由于中间的毛圈层，这款毛巾的吸水性比纯纱布的毛巾更胜一筹，整体也更蓬松，摸起来甚至有点冬天棉衣的蓬松感，但又非常轻。外层的纱布又保证了清爽的触感，格外适合作为浴巾使用。
毛巾的近距离状态，可以看到多层疏松透光的结构毛巾的标签，我到手之后直接把标签拆了，没有拍到新品缝在毛巾上的样子
我这些年的一个经验是，从所谓改善生活质量的角度出发，买更多更好更贵的大件（如电子产品）带来的幸福感往往远不如买一些高品质的小件生活用品。…</span>

今年，赛博朋克的风又刮了起来。一部《赛博朋克：边缘行者》的热播动画，不仅让游戏《赛博朋克2077》的玩家数量暴涨近400%，也让赛博朋克风再度成为亚文化讨论焦点。而说起赛博朋克美学，则绕不开一座城——香港。
香港街头琳琅满目的霓虹灯招牌，曾是赛博朋克视觉想象的灵感之源，但时至今日，这些霓虹魅影正在被拆除、消亡、遗忘。
01.赛博朋克的视觉语言
「Cyberpunk」一词源自1983年美国作家Bruce Bethke创作的短篇小说，是「Cybernetics」与「Punk」的结合词。「Cybernetics」是一种「关于在动物和机器中控制和通信」的科学研究，又称模控学，「Punk」则是由1960年代摇滚乐流派延伸出来的词，指涉那些对主流社会充满反叛精神的边缘人群。
《赛博朋克：边缘行者》中的主角出身贫民阶层
赛博朋克作品一般设定在科技高度发达的近未来，模控化的义体人或仿生人被大量应用，同时，这样的社会又往往被极权政府、跨国财团或秘密组织所掌控，导致贫富差距严重，恶劣的生存环境刺激底层punk们进行反叛。因此，高科技、低生活的反乌托邦景象成为赛博朋克作品的鲜明特征。
而赛博朋克的视觉化构建，是早于这个词诞生的。
1982年的电影《银翼杀手》，可以说是奠定了赛博朋克视觉美学的基础。片中总是雨水潮湿的街道、鱼龙混杂的路边摊、荧光闪烁的立面装饰、英文与亚洲文字混杂的霓虹灯招牌……成为众多观众心目中对于赛博朋克的经典印象，导演雷德利·斯科特曾经表示，这些布景的感觉是参考了「天气很差时的香港街道」。
电影《银翼杀手》中的街道
1995年的动画电影《攻壳机动队》则将香港与赛博朋克更紧密地联系在一起。导演押井守认为21世纪的亚洲将主导未来世界的发展，而香港是当时其他城市效仿的对象，于是他选择了香港作为片中未来大都会「新港市」的想象蓝本。

                              <span>一阵秋雨过后，忽然就意识到气温的变化，于是给衣橱换季也不得不提上了日程。
从收拾夏日衣物并分批洗涤，到把冬衣填进衣柜、不再穿的衣服送去衣物回收，一共用了三四天的时间。其中大部分时间都用在洗涤和晾晒，专门用来收拾布局的只有不到一天的时间。
之前的每次换季都不可避免地会撞上搬家，所以正儿八经的衣橱换季还是第一次。以下就是我这次整理衣橱的心得，另有对消费和断舍离的反思，希望对你有所帮助。
第一步：辞旧
此处的「旧衣服」指的是夏季的衣物，还有一些不打算再穿的衣服。
夏季出汗多，为了防止汗渍沉积，因此需要在收纳前清洗干净。如果是年初的冬夏换季，需要注意的是不能烘干的毛衣等需要更长的时间手洗、晾干，可能需要提前预留更多时间。
第一步就是把所有冬天不准备再穿的衣服都拿出来，掏干净口袋后分门别类放进不同的洗衣袋里。我的分类依据主要是洗涤方式：只可机洗不能烘干的，以及可机洗可烘干，深浅分开，一共四筐。另外还有一个纸箱，专门用来放不准备再穿的衣物。
 
洗涤先从至少需要过夜晾干的娇贵衣服开始，然后是可烘干的那些。中间我留了足够的时间，以确保大部分的衣服都能在差不多的时间内足够干爽，可以安心放进储藏室而不用担心发霉。
接下来，就是把所有衣服，按照洗涤方式分类放入收纳箱。家里的教诲是「把娇贵的衣服放在最上层才不容易被压坏」，但以我对自己的了解，天气热起来的时候肯定直接从最上层拿衣服，所以在上层放好洗的普通衣物总没错；同理，冬装收纳的最上层也是轻薄的毛衣。
这个过程中，我没有把所有洗干净的衣服都放进收纳箱，而是专门留下了许多不打算再穿的衣服。关于我的「断舍离」，会在后面有一节详细讲述。
而收起来准备明年再穿的衣服，都和一小块檀香皂放进可密封的袋子里，明年拿出来再穿的时候，衣服上就自然染上好闻的香气了！除了檀香皂，还可以尝试樟木球、香挂，以及切成小段、放进纸袋里的线香，都是可以持续散发香气、且味道不会…</span>
