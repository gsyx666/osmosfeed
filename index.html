Intel has teased its upcoming NUC 13 Extreme PC, the latest addition to the NUC (Next Unit of Computing) family of small-form-factor computers and barebone computer kits. The PC codenamed Raptor Canyon was revealed at TwitchCon this past weekend, as reported by VideoCardz, and notably sports a significantly bigger design than its predecessor to support larger graphics cards.
A teardown of the upcoming PC was carried out on the convention floor, giving us an indication of its larger size compared to previous models within Intel’s NUC range. It confirmed that Raptor Canyon can support up to a full desktop Core i9 processor and up to 64GB of DDR5 memory. 2.5 and 3-slot graphics cards are also supported, with an unnamed Nvidia GeForce RTX 30...

                              <span>Delta Airlines will invest $60 million in Joby Aviation, a leading electric air taxi startup, to create a “home-to-airport” service using the startup’s five-seat electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, the companies announced Tuesday. Delta said its investment in Joby could go as high as $200 million if the company hits certain milestones. 
The service, which will launch first in New York City and Los Angeles with other cities to follow, will be “mutually exclusive” across the US and UK for five years, with the option to extend that exclusivity for longer, the companies said. The home-to-airport service will exist in parallel to Joby’s currently nonexistent airport service, transporting passengers from cities to airports.

Roku is about to make a big entrance into the smart home if a photo posted to Reddit and two shipping manifests spotted by ZatzNotFunny are to be believed. 
The unannounced lineup reportedly consists of both white and color smart bulbs, a smart light strip, a smart plug, and indoor and outdoor internet-connected security cameras. Roku also appears to be planning to launch a dedicated Roku Smart Home channel, which will presumably let users control the devices from smart TVs and streaming boxes running the company’s operating system.

On Monday afternoon, as pointed out by Parker Molloy, CNN ended its big Web3 project by announcing, “we have decided that it’s time to say goodbye to the Vault by CNN.” 
You may have already forgotten about it, but Vault by CNN launched in the summer of 2021 as a marketplace for its own NFTs (non-fungible tokens) that would “offer collectors the opportunity to own a piece of history.” Sort of like NBA Top Shot except for media nerds instead of basketball nerds, it minted CNN reports of key events or artistic interpretations inspired by them, creating digital collectibles that owners could show off somehow or trade with others, like baseball cards. This idea apparently seemed more reasonable while cryptocurrency prices were sky-high, and...

In this article, you&#x27;ll learn how to build a team to-do list with React.js and Socket.io. Users can create, read, and delete to-dos and add comments to each to-do via Socket.io. You&#x27;ll also learn how to add notifications to the application when you create or delete a to-do item.

Just a quick background about us. Novu is the first open-source notification infrastructure. We basically help to manage all the product notifications. It can be In-App (the bell icon like you have in the Dev Community - Websockets), Emails, SMSs and so on.
I would be super happy if you could give us a star! It will help me to make more articles every week 🚀

                              <span>To cherry-pick a commit from another repository you have to first add the other repository as a remote (a remote is a repository whose branches you are tracking). You have to give the remote a name.
git remote add  https://github.com/example.git

Then, you have to fetch the branches of the remote.
git fetch 

Now that you are tracking the other repository and have fetched the changes you can list the commits of a specific branch and cherry-pick a commit.
git log otherRepo/
git cherry-pick 

In case that you don&#x27;t want to track the remote anymore you can remove it with:
git remote remove

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with express and nodejs and that you have your expressjs application up and running if not please refer to the article here
1.Install the following packages multer for file upload and mkdirp for creating multilevel directories.
2.We will create two files multer-config.js and fileupload.route.js. 
This is a middleware that will contain the logic for uploading an image. This middleware makes use of the mkdirp package to create the path to where the image file will be stored. We also added a fileFilter function to check that the file to be uploaded is an image

Firstly login to your WordPress website&#x27;s admin panel and install the free plugin named Import and export users and customers

Now in your WordPress dashboard go to Tools&gt;Export&gt;Users (in CSV format) and then Download Export File

Then download the csv file according to your preferred settings

To import users into Appwrite, we can use any Server SDK to access the Users API. For this example, we will use the NodeJS SDK.

Mobile First
Users are able to view and scroll to view the agenda, when they click the link, the will be redirected to the detailed part
A few UI requirements (font, font-size, color etc)

Repeat myself again, nothing is hard. 😎 The only concern here is:
How to deliver it fast, 
At the same time to have a good Flexibility to have changes,
And have a very goof Performance



JAMStack is quite popular, to gain better flexibility, Headless CMS could be used. For having even better flexibility, I decided to use a BaaS here.  (Read more about Comparison between BaaS and JAMStack) SupaBase is one of the stable and popular option. It is a BaaS powered by Postg…</span>

                              <span>这份简要指南能够帮助你快速开始使用 Git，以及配置一些选项。




在 Linux 中设置 Git 十分简单，但为了获得完美的配置，我做了以下五件事：


创建全局配置

设置默认名称

设置默认邮箱地址

设置默认分支名称

设置默认编辑器


我使用 Git 管理我的代码、命令行脚本以及文档版本。这意味着每次我开始一项新的任务，首先我需要创建一个文件目录并将其添加到 Git 库中：

$ mkdir newproject
$ cd newproject
$ git init


有一些我一直想要的常规设置。不多，但可以避免我每次都进行配置。我喜欢利用 Git 的 全局 配置功能。

Git 提供了进行手动配置的 git config 命令，但这有一些注意事项。例如，通常你会设置邮箱地址。你可以通过运行 git config user.email 你的邮件地址 命令进行设置。然而，这只会在你当前所在的 Git 目录下起作用。

$ git config user.email alan@opensource.com
fatal: not in a git directory


此外，当这个命令在 Git 仓库中运行时，它只会配置特定的一个仓库。在新的仓库中，你不得不重复这个步骤。我可以通过全局配置来避免重复。选项 --global 会指示 Git 将邮箱地址写入全局配置 ~/.gitconfig 文件中，甚至在必要时会创建它：


请记住，波浪线（~）代表你的主文件夹。在我的电脑中它是 /home/alan。


$ git config --global user.email alan@opensource.com
$ cat ~/.gitconfig

那一年是 2020 年，关于大流行病的消息迅速涌来，每个人都感到完全被类似的新闻文章所淹没，提供了不同程度的更新。

但我需要知道的是，我们的官方准则何时改变。最后，这就是对我来说最重要的事情。

无论关注的是大流行病还是最新的科技新闻，提前了解网站内容的变化都至关重要。

changedetection.io 项目为网站变更检测和通知提供了一个简单但强大的开源解决方案。它很容易设置，而且可以通知 70 多个（还在不断增加）不同的通知系统，如 Matrix、Mattermost、Nextcloud、Signal、Zulip、Home Assistant、电子邮件等等。它还能通知专有应用，如 Discord、Office365、Reddit、Telegram 和许多其他应用。

但 changeetection.io 并不只是局限于观察网页内容。你也可以监视 XML 和 JSON 源，它将建立一个 RSS 馈送，记录变化的网站。

由于其内置的 JSON 简单存储系统，不需要设置复杂的数据库来接收和存储信息。你可以 使用 Docker 镜像运行 或用 pip 安装它。该项目有一个 全面的维基帮助页，大多数常见的问题都有涵盖。

对于使用复杂 JavaScript 的网站，你可以用内置的 Playwright 内容获取器 将你的 changeetection.io 连接到 Chromium 或 Chrome 浏览器。

运行后，在你的浏览器（默认情况下是 http://localhost:5000）中访问该应用。如果你的电脑可以从外部网络访问，你可以在 设置Settings中设置一个密码。

                              <span>谷歌 AI 引入了一个用于数组存储的高性能开源库 TensorStore。


谷歌开发的开源 C++ 和 Python 框架 TensorStore 旨在加速大型多维数组的读写设计。覆盖单一大型坐标系的多维数据集通常用于当代计算机科学和机器学习应用程序中。使用这些数据集具有挑战性，因为客户经常希望进行涉及多个工作站并行操作的调查，并且可能会以不可预测的间隔和不同的规模接收和输出数据。

谷歌研究院开发了 TensorStore，该库为用户提供了一个可以管理巨大数据集的 API，而无需复杂的硬件，以解决数据存储和操作问题。该库支持许多存储系统，包括本地和网络文件系统、谷歌云存储等。

为了加载和处理大量数据，TensorStore 提供了一个简单的 Python API。任何任意大小的基础数据集都可以加载和更新，而无需将数据集完整存储在内存中，因为在需要精确切片之前不需要在内存中读取或保存实际数据。

这是通过索引和操作语法实现的，它与 NumPy 操作的语法非常相似。除了虚拟视图、广播、对齐和其他复杂的索引功能，TensorStore 还支持如数据类型转换、降低取样和随意创建的数组这些功能。

此外，TensorStore 包含一个异步 API，可以并发进行读取或写入操作。在执行其他工作时，软件可以进行内存缓存处理（可配置），从而减少在访问常用数据时处理较慢存储系统的需要。

大型数值数据集需要大量的处理能力来检查和分析。实现这一点的常用方法是在分散在许多设备上的大量 CPU 或加速器内核之间并行化任务。在保持出色速度的同时并行分析单个数据集的能力一直是 TensorStore 的关键目标。 PaLM、脑图和其他复杂的大规模机器学习模型是 TensorStore 应用案例的一些例子。

As a growth professional, I’ve always struggled to work with media content. Producing good blog articles is difficult enough, but working with podcasts and webinars... is a whole new can of worms.

Existing tools are built for professionals and are overpowered with features that most of us don’t need. Most podcasters and small businesses don’t have the time or resources to learn how to edit waveforms, navigate complex timelines, and create content with them. Hipclip is here to change that.

How Hipclip can help:

1. Automatically convert your podcasts and webinars into interactive transcripts visualized like a word document.

2. Edit words, not waveforms. Quickly eliminate filler words, pauses &amp; silences, and off-topic bits you don’t need. Our AI identifies these for you.

3. Repurpose long-form content into bite-sized clips to promote your episodes and win on social media. (Graphic design templates coming soon)

4. Turn your transcripts into blog posts or e-books. Make the most of your content by getting that free search traffic! (AI copywriter coming soon)

All of this works inside your browser; no need to download or install anything.

We are just getting started and super excited for what’s coming next:

- Grammarly-like assistant to further automate your work

- Seamless multi-track editing that won’t make your head spin

- 1-click sound enhancement and de-noise

And so much more!

We made a special discount for the PH community – give us a try with a code “HELLOPH”

Our team will be here all day, so feel free to drop us a comment :)

Lately, I&#x27;ve been looking at how Groovy streamlines the slight clunkiness of Java. This article examines some differences between connecting to a PostgreSQL database using JDBC in Java versus Groovy.
Install Java and Groovy
Groovy is based on Java and requires a Java installation. Both a recent/decent version of Java and Groovy might be in your Linux distribution&#x27;s repositories, or you can install Groovy by following these instructions. A nice alternative for Linux users is SDKMan, which provides multiple versions of Java, Groovy, and many other related tools. For this article, I&#x27;m using SDK&#x27;s releases of:
Java version 11.0.12-open of OpenJDK 11
Groovy version 3.0.8

设想这样一个情况吧：
你带着愉快的心情到了一个地方度假，结果在度假期间遭遇新毒株的新冠疫情爆发，全城宣布静默，城市道路、公共交通和出港港口全部封闭或停运。在配合社区每天的核酸检测和居家不出门同时，你也在仔细留意当地发布的相关信息 —— 十分幸运的是，尽管此刻的疫情还很严重，但当地已经宣布恢复机场运行，你似乎看到了一丝曙光，决定购买机票离开。
然而，事情似乎并没有你想象的这么简单。从恢复机场的商业化运行之后，到你真正坐上飞机离开这里的时间，却过去了一个月。那么这一个月里，到底发生了什么？
偶遇三亚疫情，与「幽灵航班」斗智斗勇
我和朋友在今年的 7 月 16 日回到三亚，开始为期一个月的旅居生活。然而半个月后，一起从崖州区爆发的境外输入疫情在短短几天内就席卷了整个三亚，然后迅速波及了整个海南岛内。受到疫情的影响，我和朋友只能决定提前结束旅居，在 8 月 5 日的晚上购买了 8 月 9 日从海口回广州的火车票，并决定在 8 月 6 日一早坐环岛高铁前往海口。
但计划总是赶不上变化。就在 8 月 6 日的凌晨 3 点 52 分，三亚发布发出通知，宣布全域进入静默状态。

自 2022 年 8 月 6 日凌晨 6 时起，全市实行临时性全域静态管理，除保障社会基本运行服务、疫情防控和紧急特殊情况外，全市范围限制人员流动，暂停城市公共交通。恢复时间另行通告。
原本 7 月最后一个周末还因为办音乐节而人流爆满的三亚后海主街，短短一周就变得萧条异常
好在 8 月 15 日之后，三亚宣布有序恢复凤凰国际机场国内客运航班商业化运行。这意味着，只要是符合…</span>

                              <span>如果说苹果发布会是每年一度的春晚，微信的间歇性更新就像不期而至的假期。在过去的十一年间，微信逐步从最初的简单样子一步步变迁为现在承载了许多功能和期待的国民软件。
而我作为一个非极客普通用户，在翻看朋友圈时蓦然发现这款软件自己也已经不知不觉得用了九年，发布了无数朋友圈内容和加入了许许多多的群聊。自己也从一个微信聊天使用者变成了公众号重度用户和创作者。不妨总结下过去这些年我是如何一步步从抗拒到全面使用微信的以及它带给了我日常生活哪些改变。
面朝屏幕的对话
毫无疑问，所有微信用户使用频率最高的一定是微信的基本功能：聊天。一对一或一对多，文字或语音。每个人都习惯了面对着屏幕表达自己。
加个微信
随着微信的普及，几乎没有朋友没有微信，以至于“加个微信”变成一个礼貌性和建立连接的标准动作。
我一开始并不理解为何微信会拿下偌大的市场，但过年回到老家后看到那么多中老年非QQ用户拿着微信发语音消息时，我才意识到它极大得拓宽了用户群体：“按住说话，松开发送” 简洁而易用。即便是我自己并不喜欢对面突如其来的数个60秒语音（希望微信语音能像子弹短信那样实现可以自动转为文字或者暂停播放的语音管理），但毕竟使用门槛大大降低了，而且简洁爽气的操作界面远远超过了当时花里胡哨的QQ。
所以几乎国内智能手机用户人均一个微信号时，加个微信，犹如一个登门入户的邀请，使得物理分离开之后，依旧保持了进一步交流的可能性，既有的情感更容易维系或加深。
当我们都拥有了一个便宜而高清的通讯渠道时，高昂的运营商资费带来的束缚瞬间被打破，许多亲人和朋友的联系变得频繁。当某个中秋和朋友们打着微信视频“云喝酒”，一起庆祝花好月圆夜时突然觉得科技的进步真好。如果哪一天能够启用Callkit（即像接听电话一样接听），微信电话或视频的体验应该会更好。
遇见陌生人
刚刚开始使用微信时的的朋友大多是熟人，群聊大多是家庭群，工作群，同学群。之后…</span>

Amazon Prime Day is no longer a once-per-year shopping event. This year, the company is hosting a second deal extravaganza for Prime members called the Prime Early Access Sale, which kicks off tomorrow, October 11th, and runs through Wednesday, October 12th. If it’s anything like the two-day shopping blitz that is Prime Day, it’ll be filled with some of the lowest prices we’ve seen on 4K TVs, Amazon Echo devices, noise-canceling headphones, gaming accessories, laptops, and more. We also expect to see competing deals at retailers like Target, Best Buy, and Walmart, all of which we’ll cover during the 48-hour window.
Like we’ve done in the past with Prime Day, we’ll be rounding up all of the details regarding Amazon’s fall sales event...

In an interview with the Financial Times last week, Elon Musk revealed that figures in the Chinese government have asked him directly to withhold Starlink access within China. Musk told FT that, in the publication’s summary, “Beijing has made clear its disapproval of his recent rollout of Starlink...in Ukraine” and “sought assurances he would not sell Starlink in China.”
It’s unclear from the description whether Musk agreed to Beijing’s request, but Starlink’s service map shows no plans to deploy in China. Adjacent countries like Taiwan, Mongolia and Vietnam are listed as “pending regulatory approval.”

                              <span>Hello Product Hunt 👋🏻

We&#x27;re so excited to present Grace major update for iOS16:
• Lock Screen widgets
• App Shortcuts 
• Shared across devices.

WHY
Parents had zero visibility and wasted hours in iPhone’s Settings trying to determine if and which restrictions were active on the child’s device.

It’s time to change that.

SEE WITH LOCK SCREEN WIDGETS
• Active or scheduled restrictions
• Whether the child has reached today’s screen time limit
• Whether all apps &amp; sites are blocked on the child’s device

All the information is beautifully packed into one rectangular widget.

APP SHORTCUTS
• Control the child’s device with voice through Siri
• Block all apps &amp; sites on the child’s device in one tap
• Automate your workflow: combine shortcuts and enhance the experience

SHARE ACROSS DEVICES
All restrictions are now shared across child&#x27;s devices so you don’t have to configure each child’s iPhone and iPad individually. Usage time is also summed across devices.

Grace’s core features are free. Additional features are available in the affordable Grace+ plan for $19.99/year with 14 days free trial.

👇🏻 SPECIAL OFFER
Use the code HUNTGRACE to get Grace for 2 month free (instead of the regular 14 days trial). The offer expires in a week.

We would love to hear your feedback and answer your questions!

Appreciate all your support 🙏

We were facilitating a few dozen interviews per month, and we were exhausted. Collecting feedback, maintaining the quality of interviews we were not present for, and making decisions with minimal data points. We knew we could do better, and less than a week after that Reddit post, we started building. We received backing from a VC firm with only a team and a dream just two months later. After being waitlist-only for seven months as we built out our initial offering, we&#x27;re ready to fix hiring processes for the masses, and we&#x27;re celebrating by launching on Product Hunt.

🐜 Disclaimer

The Insects JSON REST API is actually in the alpha stage, which implies that &quot;bugs&quot; and issues may still remain undiscovered until this phase of testing is complete. The alpha stage also means that the data may be corrupted, is not 100% validated or complete, and is subject to change. Finally, services may have downtime and the API schemas and calls are subject to change

两年前我们 报道 过，Linus Torvalds 攒了一台新电脑，一晃两年半过去了，如今，这台电脑的内存条坏了，频繁出现机器不稳定甚至编译器损坏的情况。当时，Torvalds 本来想买 ECC 内存，但是又嫌太贵，于是买了 4 条便宜的 16GB DDR4-2666 的内存。目前，Torvalds 使用他外出携带的 MacBook Pro 工作，但是拖慢了他的工作进度。他说，“我正在我的笔记本电脑上进行合并（非常缓慢），同时在等待新的 ECC 内存条的到来。”。

老王点评：谁能想到，整个 Linux 世界的进步瓶颈就卡在几条内存上。🤣




龙架构已初步支持开源鸿蒙操作系统

龙芯中科宣布，开源鸿蒙（OpenHarmony）操作系统与龙芯 2K0500 开发板完成适配验证，龙架构（LoongArch）平台对于开源鸿蒙已形成初步支持。龙芯 2K0500 是基于 64 位 LA264 处理器核设计的高集成度处理器芯片，该芯片主要面向工控互联网应用、打印终端、BMC 等应用场景。

老王点评：这对于龙芯和鸿蒙都是一小步，但是或许会带来更多想象空间。




英特尔确认 Alder Lake BIOS 源代码被泄露

英特尔 Alder Lake BIOS 源代码被泄露到 4chan 和 Github，这个 6GB 的文件包含用于构建和优化 BIOS/UEFI 镜像的工具和代码。但英特尔“不认为这暴露了任何新的安全漏洞”，英特尔称，“这段代码属于我们的‘断路器项目’中的漏洞赏金计划，我们鼓励任何可能发现潜在漏洞的研究人员通过该计划告知我们。”

老王点评：这件事或许没有英特尔说的那么轻描淡写，如果真的无关紧要，何不开源呢？</span>

                              <span>在最小安装的服务器中设置互联网或网络非常容易。本指南将解释如何在最小安装的 CentOS、RHEL 和 Rocky Linux 中设置互联网或网络。


当你安装了任何服务器发行版的最小安装环境，你将没有任何 GUI 或桌面环境来设置你的网络或互联网。因此，当你只能访问终端时，了解如何设置互联网非常重要。NetworkManager 工具提供了必要的工具，辅以 systemd 服务来完成这项工作。以下是方法。

在最小安装的 CentOS、RHEL、Rocky Linux 中设置互联网

在你完成了服务器的安装后，启动进入服务器终端。理想情况下，你会看到一个终端提示符。使用 root 或管理员账户登录。

首先，尝试使用 nmcli 检查网络接口的状态和详细信息。nmcli 是用于控制 NetworkManager 服务的命令行工具。使用以下命令进行检查。

nmcli device status


这将显示设备名称、状态等。



运行工具 nmtui 来配置网络接口。

nmtui 是 NetworkManager 工具的一部分，它为你提供了一个友好的用户界面来配置网络。

这是 NetworkManager-tui 包的一部分，在你完成最小服务器安装后默认安装。

nmtui


单击 nmtui 窗口中的“编辑连接Edit a connection”。



选择接口名称



在“编辑连接Edit Connection”窗口中，为 IPv4 和 IPv6 选择“自动Automatic”选项。并选择“自动连接Automatically Connect”。完成后按 “OK”。



使用以下命令通过 systemd systemctl 重启 NetworkManager 服务。

systemctl restart NetworkManager


如果一切顺利，你可以在最小安装的 CentOS、RHEL 和 Rocky Linux 服务器中连接到网络和互联网。前提是你的网络有互联网连接。你可以使用 ping 来验证它是否正常工作。



附加技巧：在最小化服务器中设置静态 IP

当你将网络配置设置为自动时，接口会在你连接到互联网时动态分配 IP。在你设置局域网的某些情况下，你可能希望将静态 IP 分配给你的网络接口。这非常容易。

打开你的网络配置脚本。将 ens3 改为为你自己的设备名。

vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens3


在上面的文件中，使用 IPADDR 属性添加所需的 IP 地址。保存文件。

IPADDR&#x3D;192.168.0.55


在 /etc/sysconfig/network 中为你的网络添加网关。

NETWORKING&#x3D;yes
HOSTNAME&#x3D;debugpoint
GATEWAY&#x3D;10.1.1.1


在 /etc/resolv.conf 中添加任意公共 DNS 服务器。

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4


然后重启网络服务。

systemctl restart NetworkManager


这就完成了静态 IP 的设置。你还可以使用 ip addr 命令检查 IP 详细信息。

总结

我希望本指南可以帮助你在最小化安装的服务器中设置网络、互联网和静态 IP。如果你有任何问题，请在评论区告诉我。

                              <span>开源代码可能是当今大多数公司最可行的选择，但它也伴随着自己的问题。


许多人支持使用 开源软件open source software（OSS）。毕竟，我们为什么要不断地尝试构建代码来解决别人已经解决过的问题？为什么不分享信息并逐步和迭代地增强当前的开源解决方案呢？这些平等主义价值观egalitarian values，可能是整个文明的根本，更不用说软件了，但还是包含了几千年来一直存在的冲突。

开源软件安全的问题在于，尽管任何人都可以查看源代码，但这并不意味着他们会这么做。有一些广泛使用的开源项目仅由数量有限的工程师维护。这些工程师无法完全自愿地提供时间和精力，因为他们也需要支付他们的账单。

即使对于更复杂的开源项目，这也是一个问题。举个例子，Linux 内核项目由 3000 多万行代码组成，包含数百个需要解决的缺陷，并有近 2000 名活跃的开发者。每个活跃的开发者都写了超过 15000 行的代码。

根据 Linux 基金会最近的一项研究，一个应用程序平均有 5.1 个重大漏洞仍未解决，41% 的企业对其开源软件的安全性缺乏信心。而更糟糕的是，只有 49% 的企业拥有开源安全策略。

即使开源软件有安全漏洞，这也不能保证它能被修复。调查显示，目前修复一个漏洞平均需要 97.8 天，使使用该软件的企业在几个月内容易受到攻击。这就是开源软件安全有时被忽视的地方：就像好人可以寻找代码中的错误和漏洞来修复它们一样，坏人也可以寻找同样的漏洞来利用它们。

仅仅依靠志愿者社区来发现漏洞、报告漏洞和修复漏洞是一个漫长的过程。在你继续受益于开源的广泛优势的同时，花钱请人检查你的开源解决方案的安全性可以帮助弥补这个问题。

由于必须部署开源软件的更新和补丁以保证系统的安全，这一要求会带来独特的困难。如果你的解决方案依赖于某个软件版本，更新你的关键任务软件可能会导致功能损失和/或计划外的停机。当情况对业务至关重要时，聘请专家来回传补丁并维护一个时间更长的版本可能比让大型社区愿意去做更加优雅。

开源社区经常使用的一句话是：“这是开源的，去改变它吧！”它强调了一个关键点：当别人在项目中投入时间、精力或金钱的时候，期望白白得到良好的安全水平是不合理的，也是不可持续的。

要么按原定计划为开源做出贡献，改进代码并为他人发布，要么聘请专业人士管理开源代码并在必要时进行调试，这些都是选择。然而，这个行业无法承担完全不做贡献。

                              <span>为英伟达显卡开发的一个全新的开源驱动正在开发中！这里有一些好的进展……




NVK 是一个全新的用于英伟达显卡的开源 Vulkan 驱动，它的目标是成为新的主流显卡驱动。

这成为可能的部分原因是因为英伟达开源了数据中心 GPU 和消费级 GPU（GTX/RTX）的 GPU 内核模块。


英伟达在改善其 GPU 在 Linux 上的体验方面迈出了重要的一步


它使开发人员能够改进开源驱动程序并启用比以前更多的功能。

让我们来看看 NVK 可以提供什么。

新的适用于英伟达 GPU 的 NVK 开源驱动程序

Jason Ekstrand（Collabora 的工程师）和 Red Hat 的其他人已经在过去几个月里编写了 NVK 的代码。

他们可以利用 Turing 系列显卡提供的统一固件 BLOB，然后在其上构建 Vulkan 支持。

但是，不是已经有了 nouveau 开源驱动程序了吗？

NVK 与其他的 nouveau 驱动非常不同，因为它是从头开始编写的。

nouveau 是一个主要的英伟达显卡的开源驱动程序，已经年久失修了，试图在它的基础上构建是一个很多人都无法承担的任务。

当然，它是由有很多才华的工程师开发的，但是缺乏公司的支持和贡献者的影响了它的发展。

NVK 旨在克服这些问题，同时专注于对 Turing 系列及更高版本 GPU 的支持。

由于内核的开发方式，对于 Kepler、Maxwell 和 Pascal 等较旧的 GPU 的支持可能不会很容易地加入 NVK。它也许极大地依赖于新内核，从而只支持较新的 GPU。

同时，nouveau 内核接口与 Vulkan 不兼容，阻碍了对较旧 GPU 的支持。

但是，仍然有进一步测试的空间，这可能会让 NVK 可以支持较旧的 GPU。

当然，随着更多的社区贡献，NVK 可以通过增加额外的功能和 GPU 支持来改进。

如何尝试它？

NVK 目前处于非常初级的状态，有很多功能缺失，并且正在持续开发中。

所以，它还不适合让所有类型的用户尝试。

你还是可以通过拉取 freedesktop.org 上的 nouveau/mesa 项目 的 nvk/main 分支并构建它来尝试它。

如果你想的话，你也可以通过贡献到该项目下的 nvk/main 分支 来帮助 NVK 的开发。

对于更多的技术信息，你可以参考 官方公告。

未来潜力

NVK 有很多潜力，尤其是与老化的 nouveau 图形驱动套件相比。

这可以为 nouveau 带来一个合适的继承者，同时为 Linux 提供一个带有很多功能的、主流的开源英伟达图形驱动套件。

💬 你对此有什么看法？你认为这最终能够实现 nouveau 驱动程序所未能实现的吗？

                              <span>前段时间清理电脑，发现「坚果云」在电脑上缓存了 50GB 平时用不上的文件。在与技术人员沟通后，被告知自从 M1 芯片发布以来，「云桥模式」的接口就无法使用，缓存只能手动清理。于是萌生了自己搭建一个 NAS 服务器的想法。
什么是NAS

NAS (Network Attached Storage：网络附属存储) 是一种连接您家中或办公室网路的智慧储存装置。您可以将家人或同事的重要文件、珍贵的相片、影音收藏等档案储存于 NAS，仅需透过网页浏览器或手机应用程式，即可轻松存取档案并享有 NAS 提供的丰富服务。

NAS 也可以简单理解为：「不限速的个性化本地网盘」。
不知道你在日常生活中是否遇到过以下的情形：

电脑的储存空间不够用，想要使用文件，但不想把所有文件存在本地；
存在百度云盘的文件或视频，下载速度仅有 69KB/s；
急需从 OneDrive 下载一个文件，却发现 OneDrive 无法打开；
迅雷下载影片，进度超过 98% 之后下载速度只有 5KB/s；
无处安放的照片存在云相册，画质受到不可逆损伤；
MAC 内建备份功能「时间机器」无处备份个人数据；
无法忍受互联网大厂的隐私乱象；
团队协作交互讨论、修改、审批效率太低，大文件传输困难；

如果你在生活中遇到过以上痛点，这篇文章或许会给你提供一个解决思路。
如何选购 NAS
目前的 NAS 市场基本被群晖和威联通垄断，即便是采用 DIY 方案，也还是要使用黑群晖或黑威联通的系统（即破解版系统）。本文以本土化更好些的群晖NAS（Synology NAS）为例，介绍如何选购家用 NAS。

我是特斯拉 Model 3 的用户，个人觉得特斯拉在大陆的导航和娱乐系统确实不太好用，当然可能也和我日常喜欢用高德导航、Spotify 听歌这些比较多有关系。相信很多特斯拉的用户也和我一样，非常希望能用上苹果的 CarPlay，但特斯拉的车机系统其实是 Linux 并且非常封闭，目前也不太存在破解和安装软件这种捷径的可能。
特斯拉 CarPlay
不过波兰的开发者 Michał Gapiński 前段时间给出了一个用树莓派的解决方法，实现了在特斯拉上使用 CarPlay。因为之前一直需要的两块树莓派的开发板，直到最近简化到了一个并且也简单稳定了不少，我也就做个教程和大家分享下。
准备工作
需要说一下，树莓派 4B 目前的价格依然比较高，整个过程也稍微有点麻烦，折腾的乐趣大于实际使用的意义，不太建议特意为这个去买树莓派，也不太建议不熟悉刷机的朋友尝试。
为了实现在特斯拉上使用 CarPlay 的效果，你需要准备：

树莓派 4B 开发板（需包含 SD 卡和读卡器）
HDMI 转 CSI-2 转接板
Micro HDMI to HDMI 连接线
车连易的 CarPlay 盒子
USB Type-C 数据线（用于刷机以及连接车供电）
一台电脑（用于给树莓派安装系统 Win Mac 都可以）
下载好系统 （版本：2022.38.1)

当然有些是可选的：比如树莓派的外壳和散热风扇，推荐选择塑料的外壳，因为金属的可能会屏蔽树莓派的 Wi-Fi 信号；如果想让特斯拉连接到树莓派的 Wi-Fi 的时候还能使用网络，则需要再购买一个 USB 4G…</span>

                              <span>我的第一部手机是在去外地上初中时，从我妈那里淘汰下来的诺基亚 3100，之后是高中时用的诺基亚 5320XM。读中学时移动互联网才初露头角，5320XM 用 100 MB 流量的 EDGE 网套餐承载了我躲在宿舍床上的摸鱼时光，按键的漆也在一条条聊天短信里被磨掉。当时我的所有朋友都在用全拼打字，而我为了提高速度，把手指挪动更少的笔划输入法练得飞快。

后来我换了 Android 机器，在还有不少想去把玩的手机没试过时，迎来了 Symbian 与诺基亚的衰落，送走了滑盖、旋盖、全键盘。移动互联网改变了我们使用手机的习惯，也同样改变手机的形态——所以当我发现还有厂商在出实体数字键盘的智能机时，就一直想找个机会试试。赶上多亲 F22 Pro 新品发布，我付了款，等过了两周的疫情，终于把它拿到了手。
这份喜悦在到手的一小时内烟消云散。

青涩但合格的硬件设计
多亲 F22 Pro 的设计和前代的 F21 Pro 其实有很多不同。
除了处理器从 MT6761 / 虎贲 T310 一下跃升到 MTK G85 以外（虽然还是挺弱的），比较显眼的就是尺寸变化。屏幕从此前的 2.8 英寸 480*640 升级到了 3.5 英寸 640*960，这样的参数现在看来可能并不出色，但它和 iPhone 4 的那块 Retina 细腻程度其实一致，文字显示效果不错。而且由于用了几天只有三英寸的 Jelly 2，这块屏幕甚至让我有种换上大屏手机的错觉。

机身和之前的多亲手机一致，依然是与功能机一样的瘦长手感，再加上与 iPhone 4 一样的屏幕和圆形的导航键，整个手机颇有一种当年 iPhone 配上 Typo 键盘壳的感觉。手机的宽度也因为屏幕增大从 53 mm 扩展到 58 mm，和现在流行的尺寸相比，仍然很容易上手。
按键方面，F22 Pro 抛弃了上代采用的孤岛式按键，转向了一体式的按键设计…</span>

NTP 是互联网的关键组成部分，几乎所有设备都运行 NTP 来保持时间一致的因果关系。它是由 David Mills 创造的。几十年来，他是决定 NTP 应该如何工作的人。但他对该协议的维护已经走向终点，他生来患有青光眼，如今已完全失明，生于 1938 年的他如今已经 84 岁高龄。而他的一位最忠实的合作者 Harlan Stenn 如今也有 66 岁了，而且退休储蓄已经耗尽了。Mills 对社区提交的代码要求严格，递交一个修复问题的补丁是不够的，还会要求给出数学分析和证明，这对于绝大多数开源贡献者来说很难。

Plasma 5.27 将是 Plasma 5 系列的最后一个功能版本

由于 Qt 6 移植和 KDE 框架 6 的开发正在全速进行，KDE 开发者决定在今年 12 月底冻结 KDE 框架 5 的功能，已经存在了 8 年的 Plasma 5 的最后一个版本将是 5.27。KDE Plasma 5.26 将在下周发布，5.27 应该在明年 2 月发布。因此，KDE Plasma 6.0，如果不出意外将在明年六月发布。

Rust 成立新的团队来制定官方编码风格

每种语言都有风格指南，如果它们足够流行，可能会有来自主要用户的多种风格指南，比如谷歌有针对 C++ 的指南，Chrome 就是用这种语言风格编写的。Rust 已经有一个官方的风格指南，比如，使用空格而不是制表符，缩进必须是 4 个空格等等。但在 2016 年至 2018 年期间负责编写风格指南的团队已经“按设计”结束了，所以 Rust 现在决定创建新的风格团队。新的团队有三个目标：对新的 Rust 结构的样式进行确定；演化现有的 Rust 风格；定义发展 Rust 风格的机制，同时考虑到向后兼容。

                              <span>负载均衡就是将资源分配到某一时刻最需要它的地方。




当个人电脑刚开始发展的时候，一个家庭可能只有一台（或更少）的电脑。孩子们白天玩电脑游戏，家长们晚上在业务支撑系统上做会计、编程，或者漫游。然而，想象一下今天一个只有一台电脑的家庭，你可以预想到这样会产生什么样的冲突。每个人都想使用电脑，而只有一副键盘和鼠标。

随着计算机变得越来越普遍，IT 行业或多或少也出现了同样的情况。对服务和服务器的需求已经增长到了会因为用量过大而停机的程度。幸运的是，我们现在有了负载均衡的概念来帮助我们处理需求。

负载均衡是什么？

负载均衡是一个通用术语，指的是为了确保高效分配所管理的资源而做的事情。对于 Web 服务器的系统管理员来说，负载均衡通常意味着确保 Web 服务器软件（例如 Nginx）配置了足够的工作节点来处理激增的访客。换言之，如果一个网站突然变得非常受欢迎，其访问者在几分钟内增加了四倍，那么运行服务器的软件必须能够响应每个访问者，并不能让任何访问者发现服务质量下降。对于简单的网站，这就像修改一行配置选项一样简单，但对于具有动态内容的复杂站点，每个用户都有多个数据库查询，这可能是一个严重的问题。

这个问题本应随着云计算的发展而解决，但当 Web 应用程序遇到意外激增时，无法扩展也不是不可能。

在进行负载均衡时，需要记住的重要一点是，高效地分配资源并不一定意味着平均地分配资源。并非所有任务都在任何时候都需要所有的可用资源。一个智能的负载均衡策略仅在需要资源时才为用户和任务提供资源。这通常是应用程序开发人员的领域，而不是 IT 基础架构的责任。异步应用程序对于确保离开计算机休息的用户不占用服务器上的宝贵资源至关重要。

负载均衡是怎么工作的？

负载均衡通过在多个计算节点上分配工作负载来避免瓶颈。这些节点可能是数据中心中的物理服务器、云环境中的容器、用…</span>

                              <span>好消息：一个免费的 Ubuntu Pro 计划，每个人都可以获得 10 年的安全更新。




Canonical 为 Ubuntu Pro 引入了一个免费计价层，该层针对个人使用和小规模部署。

Ubuntu Pro 订阅（以前称为 “Ubuntu Advantage”）最初是为企业提供的，用于为他们额外提供 5 年的 Ubuntu LTS 版本的扩展安全维护更新。

该免费计价层已在公共测试版中提供。

对于个人与数据中心的 Ubuntu Pro




目前作为测试版提供，Ubuntu Pro 的免费计价层可供个人用户或小型数据中心使用，最多可容纳五台机器。

随着此次发布，Canonical 首席执行官 Mark Shuttleworth 表示：


自从我们首次推出 Ubuntu LTS 以来，并为这个主要的操作系统免费提供五年的安全保障，我们的企业客户要求我们在私人商业协议下覆盖越来越广泛的开源领域。今天，我们很高兴通过免费的个人 Ubuntu Pro 订阅免费向世界上的任何人提供！


与标准发行版相比，Ubuntu Pro 的主要优势在于不断提供安全补丁。



对于希望系统稳定而又不会丢失安全更新的用户来说，这是一个难以置信的好消息。

安全维护更新会定期推出，尤其是在发现新的 CVE（常见漏洞和暴露）时。

用户可以利用 Livepatch 来应用安全补丁，而无需关闭他们的系统。这包含在 Ubuntu Pro 订阅中。

小型企业和个人还可以使用合规管理所需的各种工具，支持 PCI-DSS、HIPAA、FedRAMP 等合规标准，并作为 Ubuntu Pro 订阅的一部分。

那么，个人和企业使用 Ubuntu 的更多激励措施？


💡 如果你最多有五台机器要用，Ubuntu Pro 的免费个人层应该是一个不折不扣正确的选择，而不是其他平台。


借助个人 Ubuntu Pro 计划，小规模用户现在可以享受 10 年安全保障（5 年 LTS 更新 + 5 年扩展安全维护更新），其中包括对额外 23,000 个软件包的支持。

这个免费的 Ubuntu Pro 订阅层的推出可以帮助 Canonical 吸引更多用户使用 Ubuntu，这对于计算机用户采用 Linux 来说是一件好事。

你只需在他们的 官方网站 上注册个人 Ubuntu Pro 订阅。

更多详情，请查看官方公告。

💬 你会考虑选择免费的个人 Ubuntu Pro 订阅吗？ 或者，你认为你会每 5 年升级到新的 LTS 版本吗？

                              <span>Ubuntu MATE 的体验将在 2023 年进入 Debian 的 MATE 版中？从这里了解更多。




Ubuntu MATE 的创始人与维护者之一 Martin Wimpress，在 Ubuntu MATE 22.10 的测试版发布说明中提到了一些相当有趣的事情。

他的目标是将 Ubuntu MATE 的体验带到 Debian 🧐。

等等，你不是已经可以在 Debian 上安装 MATE 了吗？

是的，但是怎样使用 Debian 上的所有现代工具获得与 Ubuntu MATE 类似的用户体验呢？

将 Ubuntu MATE 的体验带入 Debian 的版本中



以下是 Martin 提到的内容：


用最近的标准来说，Ubuntu MATE 22.10 是一个适度更新，专注与“提高生活质量”。而这个版本的 Ubuntu MATE 没有采用你通常期望的桶状 🪣 变化清单是有原因的，这是因为我一直在帮助将 Ubuntu MATE 的完整体验带到 Debian MATE 🧉。


这是很吸引人的东西。

这是否意味着 Ubuntu MATE 未来不会有任何重大更新？

不，Ubuntu MATE 仍然会收到更新。

另外，Martin 还澄清说，他并没有退出 Ubuntu MATE 的开发，并且将和往常一样进行。

然而，如果你想看看 Ubuntu MATE 的主要功能更新的长列表，你必须要等待一段时间。

他打算在 Debian MATE 和 Ubuntu MATE 之间提供一致的体验。

Debian MATE 在用户中不那么受欢迎并不足为奇。主要是因为它不提供 Ubuntu MATE 那样的现代改进。

因此，他们的目标是为 Debian MATE 带来类似的体验，这将使现有用户既可以使用 Debian 也可以使用 Ubuntu。

**此外，**这将使开发变得更容易：


使 Debian 和 Ubuntu 中的 MATE 体验保持一致，使所有相关人员的维护变得更加容易。


那么，我们是否可以期待与 Debian 上是否能和 Ubuntu MATE 22.10（Kinetic Kudu）非常相似？



大概是。但这需要时间。


💡 他们希望在 Debian 12 的 Debian MATE 上提供类似的体验。我们已经知道 Debian 12 计划于 2023 年发布。因此，有足够的时间等待它。


你可以期待将 MATE Tweak 和 Ayatana Indicators 等应用程序集成到 Debian MATE 中。

这让我认为 Debian MATE 可以成为 Ubuntu MATE 用户寻求改变或想要尝试 Debian 的MATE 风格的绝佳选择。

当然，这并不会让即将到来的 Ubuntu MATE 22.10 变得不那么令人兴奋。它仍将包括许多有价值的好东西；你可能想查看它的 beta 版本说明 以了解更多信息。

💬 在了解了这一发展之后，你如何看待 Debian 未来的 MATE 版本？你会为此放弃 Ubuntu MATE 吗？让我知道你的想法！

                              <span>我在硅谷科技大厂工作，自20年初疫情爆发至今居家办公已有2年半。在此期间，为应对远程办公而打造的软件、平台、工具雨后春笋般涌现而发展壮大，工作中的沟通协同方式乃至绩效考核机制也随之发生了深刻的改变。相信如此大规模且持续的远程办公潮流在人类工业发展史上都是头一次，而这种趋势还将继续延续下去。
这股远程办公的潮流和趋势，对于身处其间的打工仔而言又有怎样的影响呢？首先要强调的是，远程办公也许并不适用于所有行业(至少在现阶段)，居家远程办公也未必适合所有人。
以我个人的经历而言，我的小孩在此期间出生现都已2岁有余，除此之外我还经历了买房升职。似乎远程办公的工作形式并没有对我的人生重要节点造成什么特别的影响。然而回过头来看又不能不承认，我的生活作息、社交活动与工作方式都已发生积极正面的改变。
居家办公始末
20年初，随着疫情的爆发和公司对于员工健康的关注，硅谷的科技公司陆续允许员工在家远程办公。除去极少数公司在初期就允诺疫情结束之后员工可以继续远程工作，绝大多数的公司还是给出了一个返回办公室的预定时间目标。不过由于漂亮国防疫政策的拉垮，这个预定时间不断地被推迟。直到疫苗的大规模铺开，最终在今年的5月前后，各大公司开始号召员工返回办公室。
2年多的远程办公已经深刻地改变了人们的生活方式：有人已经离开房价高企的硅谷或大都市搬迁到物价更低的偏远地区，有人因为家中有高危人群（老人或小孩）而不愿意回到办公司暴露在潜在的感染风险之中，有人单纯习惯了不用上下班通勤的生活而不再愿意花费时间去办公室。把四散各地的员工“驱赶”回办公室并非可一蹴而就。有感于此，大多数“开明”的公司都发布了混合办公的政策，即一周可以有若干个工作日在家办公（其余工作日仍然需要回到办公室）；又或者开放了永久远程办公的申请，为铁了心不回办公室的员工打开一个通道。某种程度而言，全员远程办公这件事情，已经在今年夏天结束。

最近需要给长辈置换一下手机，在有限的预算内，经过多次比较发现还是小米的硬件配置更好一些，最后也是下单了小米。
在 2022 年，Android 系统对手机权限的进一步限制，一些过往的卡顿问题都得到了一定的解决。但是在国内的定制版 Android 机上，和原生 Android 系统还是多了一些特色的东西：

无处不在的系统级广告，诱导用户点击/误触，从而去跳转/下载 APP
“不小心下载” 的 APP，占用宝贵的内存/硬盘资源，拖慢手机速度
国内特色的航母级 APP，一个 APP 占几个 G 的硬盘，有些小而美的应用甚至几十个 G

上面的三个问题中，前两个可以通过一定的努力解决大部分，第三个大家都没得选只能硬抗。本文就是聚焦于「关闭 MIUI 无处不在的广告」这个话题的。

虽然 MIUI 一直有 ADUI 的称呼，但是个人身处这个行业也能表示理解：
小米把硬件上的利润压到了最低，赚不到钱就要从其他路子上想办法，只能不停的“加点儿广告怎么了”

废话不多说，我们直接开始。

本文成文于 2022.09，使用的是 MIUI 13.0.4 版本，随着时间的推移，其它版本 MIUI 可能有操作不一致的情况，这点需要读者注意。

一、通过常规手段关闭广告推送
1.1 关闭系统广告
MIUI 的许多内置应用（例如 天气、万年历、音乐）和系统级页面（例如桌面文件夹）上都会推送一些贴片广告，诱导用户观看和点击。
可能用户反馈过于激烈，2019 年年末某个版本更新中，新增了「一键关闭系统广告」的功能。这个开关也很好找，我们直接进入「设置」，然后在搜索框里输入「系统广告」，然后点击进入新页面，把「系统工具广告」这个开关关上即可。

                              <span>相信对于很多小伙伴来说，Twitter并非单纯是一个“社交”平台，而是“信息获取”平台。通过追踪各类名人、机构的账号来了解所关注领域的最新动向。比如最近火热的NFT、Web3.0社区中就有大量的意见领袖在Twitter发声。
然而从获取信息效率的视角来看，常规Twitter浏览界面并不是特别友好，时间线上有着各类广告，同时经常用着用着就发现自己迷失在几十个选项卡和搜索结果页中。如果你遇到过类似问题，并希望提高在Twitter获取信息的效率，我会强烈推荐Tweetdeck这个功能。
Tweetdeck是Twitter官方提供的在线工具，有模块化，高度自定义化的浏览界面，不仅适合专业的Twitter运营人员工作使用，也非常适合个人用户来改造优化自己的信息时间线。通过对比图片，可以很清楚的看到两种模式的差异。Tweetdeck可以在设置中选择 黑/白 两种显示模式，我个人更喜欢黑暗模式，看起来更轻松。

基础介绍
Tweetdeck和常规界面相比最重要的功能主要是3点：自动刷新、多列显示和自定义模块。自动刷新不需要过多解释，节省频繁刷新的操作和时间。自定义模块可以定制每一列种显示的内容，例如：

我想单独查看Elon Musk的所有推特或者他直发的内容。 - 单用户模式
我希望把多个账号归为一个主题，单独浏览，如：NBA球星们、实时股市新闻、NFT相关资讯。 - 清单模式
我想追踪网友对正在发生的热点事件的评论，如：WWDC大会、俄乌冲突事件等 - 搜索模式

多列显示则大幅度提升了屏幕利用率，让我们可以同时间追踪上述这些不同的主题。

上图是我最近使用Tweetdeck的截图，我通过Vivaldi浏览器“垂直平铺”功能在右边放置了Tesla AI Day的视频直播，在左边放置了Tweetdeck，并添加了：“tesla ai day”搜索结果列、“tesla bot”搜索结果列、Elon的个人内容列，和常用的市场资讯列。
 
模块选择
在Tweetdeck中，可以选择添加多种不同的模块，其中包含，
内容类模块：单用户模式、搜索模式、清单模式、正在流行内容等
功能类模块：通知、站内信、@我的、已预约内容等
我并没有做账户运营的需求，因此最常使用的还是：搜索结果、单个用户、多用户清单这几个内容类模块。
可添加模块截图
 
搜索模式：
显示关键词搜索结果配合自动刷新功能，达成“直播”的效果。并且可以通过设置条件对搜索结果进一步筛选，可设置条件包含：

按推文类型过滤：例如包含图片、视频、GIF等的推文；或者是否显示“转发”内容。
筛选内容的发布时间范围，最小单位可以精确到半个小时。
按照推文语言类型筛选，例如：中文、英文、日语等。
筛选推文发布者：选择特定的单个用户或者一组用户的搜索结果。
内容互动情况：显示至少有多少点赞、转发或评论的内容。

 
单用户模式 &amp; 多用户清单：
这2个模式本质差别就是关注用户的多少，选定关注范围后的筛选条件选项完全一致。在这2个模块中，同样可以通过设置筛选条件，包含：

按推文类型过滤：例如包含图片、视频、GIF等的推文；或者是否显示“转发”内容。
关键词过滤：显示或排除包含指定关键词的内容。
用户筛选：由指定用户发布的内容 或 @特定用户的内容。

在Tweetdeck追踪的，不管是单用户还是清单，并不要求是关注的账户。这点非常贴心，也帮助我区分不同使用场景，我把大量“新闻资讯”类账号从关注列表中去除，放在Tweetdeck清单中，日常在手机上浏览就不会被刷屏，而更关注轻松的内容，坐在电脑前则可以追踪查看这些庞杂的资讯。
在Tweetdeck创建的清单可以选择设置为公开或者私有列表，同时这个列表也会同步到常规界面左侧的列表按钮中。

 
模块设置：
这几个内容模块中都可以单独设置“媒体展示尺寸大小”，可以大体理解为模块中每一条内容的高度。以及是否通过“声音”或者“桌面通知”的形式发送通知，提示关注的内容有更新。

Tweetdeck是简单，但又很强大的工具，给我带来了很多的便利，也希望分享给大家，打造适合自己的内容模块。
 
PS：
Tweetdeck访问地址：https://tweetdeck.twitter.com
今年Twitter官方下架了Tweetdeck的桌面客户端软件，仅提供网页版本，如果想在电脑上安装独立客户端可以使用Tweeten，有Windows和Mac版本，并且基于Tweetdeck提供了更多的功能。

在不久之前，我写了一篇文章，大概讲了一下我认为出国留学「摄影」这件事对我而言的几个较有价值的部分，其中有一点是获得了「从学术的角度出发理解摄影」的一个方法。今天我就打算展开讲讲我从英国这个摄影的「发源地」学到的方法论之——如何理解摄影，希望和大家一同探讨。
需要提醒的是，这篇文章里有一些学术概念，我已经用了尽量简单易懂的方式表述，但出于对「信息传递更精准」的目的，我依然保留了一些可能不好理解的名词，建议大家收藏本文，慢慢看。
首先，我想先对「理解摄影」这个话题加上一个更具体的语境，即——如何用一种具有创造性的方式理解摄影，而这也是我们上个学年在讨论的一个核心议题：「The central question will be how to read photographic images in an innovative manner. 」。
正如上面提到的，「用创造性的方式解读摄影」，这个表述背后事实上是默认了在「创造性 」的解读照片的方式背后还有一种「非创造性」的方式解读照片。那么所谓的「非创造性」和「创造性」指的是什么呢？让我们先从「非创造性」开始说起。
「非创造性」——摄影的本质
首先，要从沃克·埃文斯（Walker Evans）在 1931 年写的一篇名为《摄影的重生》（The Reappearance of Photography）的文章说起。这篇文章里提到了尤金·阿杰特（Eugene Atget）、史泰钦（Edward Steichen）、阿尔伯特·伦格-帕茨（Renger Patzsch）等多位摄影师的作品，并对他们有…</span>

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol based on SSLv3 designed to encrypt and decrypt traffic between two sites. In other words, TLS ensures that you&#x27;re visiting the site you meant to visit and prevents anyone between you and the website from seeing the data being passed back and forth. This is achieved through the mutual exchange of digital certificates: a private one that exists on the web server, and a public one typically distributed with web browsers.
In production environments, all servers run securely, but server certificates may expire after some period. It is then the server&#x27;s responsibility to validate, regenerate, and reuse newly genera…</span>

@甜食：神藤毛巾内毛圈浴巾

入手渠道：淘宝
入手价格：370 元

最近因为搬家，许多生活用品需要重新购买，其中自然也包括各类卫浴洗漱用品这种又占空间、单价又便宜，导致搬走不如买新的的物件。在物色新浴巾的时候，我发现了神藤毛巾这个品牌。神藤毛巾是日本大阪的毛巾品牌，有别于传统的毛圈表面的毛巾，他们的产品以棉纱材质的毛巾见长。
传统毛巾的毛圈材质表面积更大，用来清洁自然是效率更高的，不过生活在南方的读者应该多少都会有潮湿天气下毛巾连日难以风干，甚至产生异味的经验，神藤的毛巾采用了多层纱布的织法，既保证了良好的吸水性，疏松的质地也让毛巾更加速干，同时比较平滑的表面也提供了更清爽的触感。
我最终购买的这款产品叫作 Inner Pile，算是神藤毛巾比较创新的一款产品（和很多刻板印象中的日本作坊式品牌一样，他们总共只有三款产品 —— 另外两款是多层棉纱毛巾「2.5-PLY GAUZE」和传统的毛圈毛巾「YUKINE」，具体用途只通过尺寸来区分），由外层的两层纱布夹着中间的一层毛圈构成。由于中间的毛圈层，这款毛巾的吸水性比纯纱布的毛巾更胜一筹，整体也更蓬松，摸起来甚至有点冬天棉衣的蓬松感，但又非常轻。外层的纱布又保证了清爽的触感，格外适合作为浴巾使用。
毛巾的近距离状态，可以看到多层疏松透光的结构毛巾的标签，我到手之后直接把标签拆了，没有拍到新品缝在毛巾上的样子
我这些年的一个经验是，从所谓改善生活质量的角度出发，买更多更好更贵的大件（如电子产品）带来的幸福感往往远不如买一些高品质的小件生活用品。…</span>

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a standard for how computers, servers, and people communicate within a system. It was the first standard model for network communications and was adopted in the early 1980s by all major computer and telecommunications companies.
The OSI model provides a universal language for describing networks and thinking about them in discrete chunks, or layers.
Layers of the OSI model
The model describes the seven layers through which computer systems communicate over a network.
Application layer
Presentation layer
Session layer
Transport layer
Network layer
Data link layer
Physical layer
Each of these layers has its own way of working, with its own set of protocols that disti…</span>

Apache ShardingSphere, a powerful distributed database, recently released a major update to optimize and enhance its features, performance, testing, documentation, and examples. In short, the project continues to work hard at development to make it easier for you to manage your organization&#x27;s data.
1. SQL audit for data sharding
The problem: When a user executes an SQL query without the sharding feature in large-scale data sharding scenarios, the SQL query is routed to the underlying database for execution. As a result, many database connections are occupied, and businesses are severely affected by a timeout or other issues. Worse still, should the user perform an UPDATE/DELETE operation,…</span>

今年，赛博朋克的风又刮了起来。一部《赛博朋克：边缘行者》的热播动画，不仅让游戏《赛博朋克2077》的玩家数量暴涨近400%，也让赛博朋克风再度成为亚文化讨论焦点。而说起赛博朋克美学，则绕不开一座城——香港。
香港街头琳琅满目的霓虹灯招牌，曾是赛博朋克视觉想象的灵感之源，但时至今日，这些霓虹魅影正在被拆除、消亡、遗忘。
01.赛博朋克的视觉语言
「Cyberpunk」一词源自1983年美国作家Bruce Bethke创作的短篇小说，是「Cybernetics」与「Punk」的结合词。「Cybernetics」是一种「关于在动物和机器中控制和通信」的科学研究，又称模控学，「Punk」则是由1960年代摇滚乐流派延伸出来的词，指涉那些对主流社会充满反叛精神的边缘人群。
《赛博朋克：边缘行者》中的主角出身贫民阶层
赛博朋克作品一般设定在科技高度发达的近未来，模控化的义体人或仿生人被大量应用，同时，这样的社会又往往被极权政府、跨国财团或秘密组织所掌控，导致贫富差距严重，恶劣的生存环境刺激底层punk们进行反叛。因此，高科技、低生活的反乌托邦景象成为赛博朋克作品的鲜明特征。
而赛博朋克的视觉化构建，是早于这个词诞生的。
1982年的电影《银翼杀手》，可以说是奠定了赛博朋克视觉美学的基础。片中总是雨水潮湿的街道、鱼龙混杂的路边摊、荧光闪烁的立面装饰、英文与亚洲文字混杂的霓虹灯招牌……成为众多观众心目中对于赛博朋克的经典印象，导演雷德利·斯科特曾经表示，这些布景的感觉是参考了「天气很差时的香港街道」。
电影《银翼杀手》中的街道
1995年的动画电影《攻壳机动队》则将香港与赛博朋克更紧密地联系在一起。导演押井守认为21世纪的亚洲将主导未来世界的发展，而香港是当时其他城市效仿的对象，于是他选择了香港作为片中未来大都会「新港市」的想象蓝本。

                              <span>一阵秋雨过后，忽然就意识到气温的变化，于是给衣橱换季也不得不提上了日程。
从收拾夏日衣物并分批洗涤，到把冬衣填进衣柜、不再穿的衣服送去衣物回收，一共用了三四天的时间。其中大部分时间都用在洗涤和晾晒，专门用来收拾布局的只有不到一天的时间。
之前的每次换季都不可避免地会撞上搬家，所以正儿八经的衣橱换季还是第一次。以下就是我这次整理衣橱的心得，另有对消费和断舍离的反思，希望对你有所帮助。
第一步：辞旧
此处的「旧衣服」指的是夏季的衣物，还有一些不打算再穿的衣服。
夏季出汗多，为了防止汗渍沉积，因此需要在收纳前清洗干净。如果是年初的冬夏换季，需要注意的是不能烘干的毛衣等需要更长的时间手洗、晾干，可能需要提前预留更多时间。
第一步就是把所有冬天不准备再穿的衣服都拿出来，掏干净口袋后分门别类放进不同的洗衣袋里。我的分类依据主要是洗涤方式：只可机洗不能烘干的，以及可机洗可烘干，深浅分开，一共四筐。另外还有一个纸箱，专门用来放不准备再穿的衣物。
 
洗涤先从至少需要过夜晾干的娇贵衣服开始，然后是可烘干的那些。中间我留了足够的时间，以确保大部分的衣服都能在差不多的时间内足够干爽，可以安心放进储藏室而不用担心发霉。
接下来，就是把所有衣服，按照洗涤方式分类放入收纳箱。家里的教诲是「把娇贵的衣服放在最上层才不容易被压坏」，但以我对自己的了解，天气热起来的时候肯定直接从最上层拿衣服，所以在上层放好洗的普通衣物总没错；同理，冬装收纳的最上层也是轻薄的毛衣。
这个过程中，我没有把所有洗干净的衣服都放进收纳箱，而是专门留下了许多不打算再穿的衣服。关于我的「断舍离」，会在后面有一节详细讲述。
而收起来准备明年再穿的衣服，都和一小块檀香皂放进可密封的袋子里，明年拿出来再穿的时候，衣服上就自然染上好闻的香气了！除了檀香皂，还可以尝试樟木球、香挂，以及切成小段、放进纸袋里的线香，都是可以持续散发香气、且味道不会…</span>

前言
开始的时候我就决定了，未来哪天必定要写这样的一篇阶段性总结文章，只不过那时设想的时间点远在第十个视频之后，而这天的到来比我所预期的要早很多，因为很幸运地提前完成了一个年初定下的小目标，全网 5 万关注达成了。
也因为我的账号起源与少数派这个网站有莫大关系，所以选择将这篇长文首发于此，希望能帮到对运营 B 站有想法、以及对视频剪辑工具有需求的同学。

数字文具盒征文活动 中看到许多将 Obsidian 纳入日常学习工作流的好文章，想必使用过程中或多或少都与命令（command）打过交道。所谓命令，其实就是在 Obsidian 执行的各种操作：新建文档、星标文档、打开大纲面板等常规操作，以及所有与插件的交互、使用快捷键执行的操作……这些都是命令。
和许多文本编辑器一样，Obsidian 内建了一个命令面板（Command Palette），用于快速搜索并执行命令。默认的快捷键 ⌘+P 唤起方便是方便，只不过这个内建的命令面板还是略显简陋了：只能搜索，顶多在设置中将常用命令置顶，就没了。它没办法记忆最近使用的项目，每次都要重新查找；并且文本编辑、核心插件、社区插件的命令一股脑儿混在一起，很多 几乎永远用不到的命令，由于首字母的关系，排名却很靠前。
尽管 Obsidian 一直在更新，也已经增加了许多呼声颇高的内容（比如 窗口多开），但还是没有往命令面板上做文章。你可能会说，常用的命令，用用快捷键就好了呀。不过我的系统全局快捷键已经很多了，所以除了极为常用的诸如加粗（⌘+B）这种命令，我还是倾向用快捷键以外的方式去执行命令。
那么本文将介绍三款优秀的社区插件，让 Obsidian 的命令更为好用。

写在前面：

本文若涉及快捷键，那么 modifier key 将会使用 Mac 标准的 ⌘、⌥、⇧ 等，Windows 系统请相应替换。
随着 Obsidian 的更新，许多插件已不再适配或是迁移、合并至新的版本。本文推荐的插件都是写作时点（2022-09-20）能够使用的。

                              <span>前言
为了在上班前再抓紧时间享受一下旅行的快乐，我和女朋友一起去了一趟杭州和绍兴。十年前，我和父母曾经去过一次杭州和苏州，但那时正值盛夏，酷暑难耐，我的父亲出行时又是出了名的紧张和暴躁，导致少了不少游玩的乐趣，杭州在我心目中也并没有留下什么深刻的印象。在一位杭州「土著」同学的怂恿下，为了帮助杭州洗刷这个对她并不公平的心理评价，我决定再来一次杭州。
按照这位同学说，我们这一次来得正是时候，赶上了杭州为期两周的秋天，早来了太热，晚来了太冷。
她是没错的。九月底的杭州真的是——好舒服啊！
除了正午那几个小时，杭州的天气这几天一直稳定在很适宜的温度，在室内和室外几乎没有温差。哪怕是上午快十二点，大晴天走在大街上也只是有丝丝暖意，如果这时候有几阵微风从西湖吹来，送上岸边荷叶清新的香气和清凉，我就会情不自禁地把手臂张开，闭上眼睛，好好感受这让人舒服得跺脚的惬意。
因为我们这一次以休闲游为主，并没有安排很满的行程，这几天都是睡到自然醒，吃完饭中午才出门，所以行程上也安排得不是很有效率。作为一个旅行攻略太过勉强，但也确确实实享受到了放空身心的那种悠闲和惬意。
灵隐寺
食
很惭愧，这一次是摆烂的行程。因为不想时间太紧张，所以并没有专门搜一些当地人才会去的苍蝇馆子，吃的都是比较常见的连锁餐厅，外婆家、新白鹿、绿茶。我这个外地人尝不出地不地道，但坐着挺舒适，味道也挺好的。我特别喜欢西湖天地那家外婆家，旁边就是西湖，吃完饭去消消食也是一流的。
第一天晚上杭州的同学带我们去银泰附近吃了一家名为杭州酒家的餐厅。据说已经有一百年历史了。叫花鸡被一层壳包裹，需要客人颇具仪式感地亲自敲几下，而后师傅再帮忙敲开，鸡肉已经酥软无比，香味甚至渗进了骨头；熏鱼比我想象中的多汁，带着一种甜甜的味道；藕粉样子很好看，但感觉味道稍淡了些，响铃沾了不同的酱料味道很丰富。

Awk is a powerful scripting tool that makes it easy to process text. Awk scripts use a pattern-action syntax, where Awk performs an action for every line in a file that matches a pattern. This provides a flexible yet powerful scripting language to deal with text. For example, the one-line Awk script /error/ {print $1, $2, $3} will print the first three space-delimited fields for any line that contains the word error.
While we also have the GNU variant of Awk, called Gawk, the original Awk remains under development. Recently, Brian Kernighan started a project to add Unicode support to Awk. I met with Brian to ask about the origins of Awk and his recent development work on Awk.

                              <span>2021年9月，也许是某一个灵光乍现的瞬间，也许是受到学姐和其他老师重读红楼梦的触动，我开始对红楼梦感到好奇：到底是怎样的一本小说，能成为一代又一代人终身治学的根基。考虑到我浅薄的文化素养，直接阅读文本收益不大，于是曲线救国，从他人的解读开启红楼之旅，所以试听了被高频推荐的《欧丽娟讲红楼梦》。

一入坑就被深深抓住了，198讲，每讲1.5～2h，听之前觉得太多了这怎么可能听得完，听之后感觉时间过得飞快，书里的时间，视频里的时间，还有现实生活中的时间，三条时间线交织重叠，构筑成一个亦真亦幻的世界。
这篇文稿不是为了总结300多小时的视频内容，只是作为一个外行人，分享在窥探瑰丽文学世界时的一些发现，以及这段经历给我带来的改变，包括对红楼梦观感的变化，对学问的深入理解，以及对自身心智模型的重塑。
书中的道理--超越风花雪月，草木荣枯
听完198讲红楼梦，更新了我对红楼梦的认知。目前我对红楼梦的理解，从它是一部关于贵族爱情的小说，变成了它是一部关于人的小说。
金玉良缘与木石前盟，映射着青春期的少男少女对爱情的懵懂。在我还没有足够的耐心去咀嚼优美的文字和艺术的行为前，一连串的言辞已经给我大脑一种“我已知晓此书”的信号：忧郁柔弱的林妹妹和纯真无邪的富家贵公子，爱而不得和包办婚姻，隐忍的，圣洁的；凄清的，热闹的；荒凉的，繁盛的……，构成了红楼的初印象：首先，世界并不只围绕着我；其次，即便如此，我也会被人无条件地坚定地选择。这种印象也可以被概括为：才子佳人模式。
曾经关注发生在人身上的情感流转，视频将我的视角转移到人本身。描写人物关系和个体命运的小说有那么多，红楼梦的精妙之处，是超越了风花雪月，草木荣枯。
每一个人物专论，都很容易让人产生强烈两个阶段的情绪共鸣。第一阶段，太真实了，这不就是我嘛。他们身上有非常鲜明的人格特质，其行事逻辑也能在我们身上找到影子。于国于家无望的宝玉，虽柔弱不安也…</span>

Don Watkins

Not that long ago, docking a laptop was a new idea to me. Since then, I&#x27;ve set up two different laptops for docking, and I&#x27;ve been more than satisfied with how this configuration works. This article describes how I set up the laptop docking stations and gives tips and guidance for anyone considering the same.
How I discovered docking
I began 2020 with one laptop: a Darter Pro purchased from System76 the year before. It had been more than adequate, and I enjoyed the freedom of movement that toting a laptop gave me. Then, of course, everything changed.
Suddenly, I was at home all the time. Instead of an occasional video conference, remote meetings and get-togethers became the norm. I grew tired of the little square …</span>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

首先，非常开心少数派上婉莹和甜食大大的播客制作栏目《100 小时后请叫我播客主理人》终于上线了，两位都是我很尊敬的播客制作者，之前也和两位有过关于播客和其他领域（比如音乐收藏和泉州故事）的交流，相信这个栏目一定会给到各位对于播客有兴趣的朋友很多帮助。
关于如何制作播客的相关教程，互联网上已经不少了，我自己之前也和生产力维基的白宦成合作过一期简单教学版本《小白和大耳的播客入门指南》，私下里我也在深圳线下做过几次关于制作播客的心得分享。很多教程和指南往往会集中在技术，设备，内容策划和运营等等方面，是一种「法」或者「术」层面上的描述，对于大多数的个人播客制作者，尤其是以兴趣为出发点的制作者来说，往往看了一些指南以后，就「一时兴起」录制并上传了自己的第一期节目，然后经历了一段时间的「方兴未艾」后，在某个时间突然因为繁忙的工作打断了「周更」的节奏，于是「戛然而止」。我自己的节目《对讲鸡 RadioChicken》也经历过几次这样的过程，曾经我也对诸如断更和订阅数减少（即使现在小宇宙的订阅只有 300 多个，最近几十个还都是各种社交 app 认识的）感到失落甚至焦虑，但经历了一些列佛系的思考后，我发现制作播客对我自己的意义，完全不在于「向外展示性表达」，更多的喜悦和快乐，反而在于「向内探索性成长」。
所以今天我想就此分享一些关于「向内探索性成长」的心得，希望对于各位对于播客有兴趣，甚至已经开始制作播客的朋友有所启发。
降低期待
我给新人播客制作者的第一个建议，是做好「降低期待，甚至不要有期待」的心理建设。我相信可能会有部分朋友开始做播客的原因…</span>

                              <span>我的 AirPods Pro 2 还没发货，我的 AirPods Pro 1 已经吃灰很久。AirPods Pro 的耳塞我越来越戴不稳，再加上比较「白开水」的调音，以及削弱后的主动降噪效果，让我觉得虽然 AirPods Pro 综合体验不错，但总是少了点意思，对我这个 PC 玩家来说使用场景也有些窄。
在 PC 上玩游戏，我始终不喜欢用头戴耳机，太大一坨挂头上，戴久了累，耳朵闷，还压头发。习惯各种无线 TWS 之后，我也无法再适应回去用有线耳机，有根线扯着，会极大降低我起身活动的频率。所以 TWS 真无线耳塞一直是我的心头好。
以我常玩的 PUBG 为例，PC 桌面端能用来打游戏的真无线耳塞，至少必须得延迟够低，才有可能听声辨位，这样的耳塞市面上少之又少。所以很自然地，踩中我的喜好和需求的怒喵 CYBERBLADE 在发售后，我第一时间就上手并主力用了一段时间。所以这篇文章，我想分享一些我的体验感受。内容比较主观，没有受任一方干涉。
先说结论：抛开前期我也不喜欢的营销方式不谈，上手后的 CYBERBLADE 本身没有让我失望。它主打的桌面端体验不错，实物的质感挺好，佩戴舒适度和音质也有超出我预期，虽然缺点短板都有，但它确实可以称得上是我用过的最好的 PC 桌面端 TWS，而且，没有之一。
我是不是说得太满？请注意定语——「PC 桌面端 TWS」。就像我刚说的，PC 桌面端、能低延迟打游戏的真无线耳塞，市面上的可选项就没两个，这个垂直细分品类太小众，愿意像怒喵这样认真做一个偏高端定位好产品的厂商，更是没有。
你可以说怒喵只是在讨巧，从成熟的音频市场，挑了个没什么竞争的品类来做，没啥了不起；但对我这种目标受众来说，有人做了我需要的东西，并且除了核心的桌面低延迟游戏体验 OK 之外，还做出了别家没有的特色，就很棒。

CYBERBLADE 到底是个怎样的 TWS 耳机？

如果你来武汉的时间只有一天，那去江边走上一天，便可以心中有谱地说出：我去过武汉了。那些或声势显赫或寂寂无名的景色，许许多多便是散布在长江汉水之畔的。

漫步路线：江汉路-江汉关-武汉科学技术馆-汉口江滩
江汉路
每个城市里都有一条名号最响的路，在北京是王府井大街，在上海是南京路，在广州是上下九，在武汉自然就是江汉路了，江汉路很长，它的一头伸到了江边，另一头连着解放大道，被誉为「天下第一步行街」。江汉路在清末时期叫做广利巷，是商人集资修建来往贸易之用的。1861 年，汉口开埠之后，洋人也是看中了这里的临江的交通便利之处，便在广利巷附近的地盘上相继建立租界，江汉路便逐渐形成。现今江汉路著名的建筑，即是当年各个租界遗留的场所。
江汉路沿路与江汉一、二、三路，黎黄陂路，保成路，水塔街等道路相连。弯弯绕绕，一转身，便可以看到不同风景。黎黄陂路是旧时汉口俄租界上的街道改造而成，作为一条拥有百年历史的老路，黎黄陂路见证着滚滚的历史车轮从此经过，漫步在这里，主要体会宁静，在老时光咖啡馆里享受一段悠然时光，在小物商行里欣赏别出心裁的饰件，或是在路上发发呆，看一看那些时不时提着婚纱走过的新人。保成路是承袭了几十年不断演变的夜市，短短几百米的道路上承载了近千家小商贩，漫步在这里…</span>

                              <span>使用 Obsidian 的过程中发现一些痛点：
1&gt; 使用插件 annotator 时，引用的文本内不能添加链接

如果强行将关键字改成链接，就会出现格式错乱

我想要的效果如下：引用的文本能够给添加链接

2&gt; 使用简悦剪藏文章时 ，文章内的图片是外链。如果图片是外链，那么如果外链链接失效了就找不回图片了

我想要的效果如下：将外链转为图床的链接

3&gt; Media Extended 虽然能使用链接跳转到视频指定时间点，但是手写链接太麻烦了

我想要的效果：自动生成一个视频的全部字幕和引用，且每句字幕和一点时间点引用呈一一对应的关系

❗❗❗为了节省大家的时间，我在文末写了我常用的 Obsidian 插件的下载链接，这些插件中有部分插件的源码都是被我修改过的，有两个需要注意的事项：

被我修改过源码的插件不全是可以直接用的，比如发送图片到 Picgo 时的 url 要换成你在 Picgo 内设置的 url
修改过源码的插件不要升级，如果升级了会导致修改失效

❗❗❗再附加一个注意事项：

入门简悦的时候如果运气不好（比如我），会遇到很多问题，如果看了入门文章还是解决不了就到 https://github.com/Kenshin/simpread/issues 提交自己的问题，简悦的开发者回复消息还是挺快的（顺便夸夸开发者很积极，这很难得）

修改 annotator 引用格式
使用工具
Annotator：是一个用于给 pdf 做标注和跳转的开源插件
Linter：是一个用于格式化笔记的开源插件
配置 Linter
目标：修改其源代码，添加将 Annotator 样式修改为 📌
添加规则分类：

添加具体的规则处理：

代码如下：
