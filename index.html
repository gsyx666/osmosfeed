                              <span>Django is a great web framework for fast development. Django Admin allows you to manage your data without creating your own views. 
The primary use case of the Admin is CRUD operations. You can populate your local database with test data or change some real data in the production environment.
Sometimes, you need some custom interfaces to perform your routines on the project. Fortunately, Django Admin has a lot of room for customization. In this guide, I&#x27;ll show how to create a custom detail page in Django Admin.
Let&#x27;s start from scratch. I&#x27;ll use python3.9 in this guide. If you are not interested in the basic details, you can jump to the custom Order page part.
First, create a virtual environment and install Django. Also, we need Pillow for Django&#x27;s ImageField:

                              <span>In the universe of npm, there are a lot of packages to choose from, so knowing which one to choose from can be very difficult. In This article, we will first look at the categories of libraries which are server-side-rendering, animation,state-management, and General Utilities and we will then look at the packages under these categories.
The npm packages in this category are just packages that are helpful so few specific tasks and you may eventually need them. The packages in this include:
moment.js -- very good for working with dates
Axios -- good for handling async tasks 
React-hot-toast, React-toastify — handling small notifications and toasts
react-icons,&quot; @mui&quot;/icons-material  —  For icons
react-paginate —  For pagination 
React-share — Share things Socially

React-slick, react-responsive-carousel — For Carousel 
clsx — For conditional classes 
react-intersection-observer — For intersection 
react-dropzone  — For file upload and drag and drop
Bringing animation to your site just makes it more fun and pleasant for your viewers. That being said, the packages under animation include:
GSAP
Framer motion
React-spring
Anime.js
Sometimes the data in your React.js application can be very difficult to manage effectively and the React content API isn&#x27;t just good enough. That being said, the packages under state management include:
Redux
Redux Toolkit -- my personal favourite
Recoil
Mobx
React Context -- not recommended for big projects
if you are building a highly optimized robust website you will need an SSR framework because they make routing easier, they fetch data on the server and return to the component, they optimize images so it doesn&#x27;t bottleneck performance, and much more. That being said, the packages under server-side rendering include:
 Next.js
Gatsby.js -- for only SSG (static site generation)
Remix

While being able to code is certainly a valuable skill, it&#x27;s not the quintessential element when it comes to landing a job in tech. 
In today&#x27;s tech landscape, employers are looking for various skills, such as problem-solving and critical thinking. So if you&#x27;re not a coder, don&#x27;t worry; there are still plenty of ways to get your foot in the door.

                              <span>What terms would you utilize to define software development? Is it something that you have to work hard at or does it come naturally to you? If you are unfamiliar with software development, you may be surprised by some of the custom software development challenges involved.
The process of creating programs and applications that perform specific tasks is known as software development. The process begins with requirements definition, then moves on to designing the program, coding it, testing it, and finally deploying it into production.
&quot;Developing custom software is a difficult task; several aspects of software development require attention, such as selecting the right programming language, understanding design patterns, and knowing the tools needed to build the application.&quot;

                              <span>Coding is not always an easy task. Many people face many obstacles in their development journey. Encountering tricky bugs, tackling difficult coding concepts, job hunting, career growth etc.
Communities help developers connect with others who share the same experiences, failures, and successes in the industry.
“You end up learning a lot just trying to answer the questions correctly. You end up solidifying your knowledge. This may be something you&#x27;ve seen before, but when you try to teach it, you learn quite a bit as well.” - Daniel Tew (Software Developer at Trello).
There are many Communities out there where there are lakhs of developers helping each others , Collaborating and learning new skills daily. However it is sometimes difficult for someone who is especially new and wants to be the part of such big communities as you might be unnoticed, so it&#x27;s good if you can join Communities that are new and adding values as these communities are new so there is high chance that you will get full attention and you can become most important members of the community if you are contributing and adding value in it.
We are also Creating a Community for Developers where we are posting new Jobs from some of the best companies out there &amp; also posting Coupon codes of some of the best courses on development. You can collaborate with other community members and create something meaningful. Moreover there are many senior developers in the community so if you are looking for a referral you can request for the same as well.
You can join us on Slack or Discord whichever platform you are more comfortable with.
The developer community becomes stronger through collaboration. So let&#x27;s Collaborate and build something meaningful.</span>

Most of the time that I spent on social media was now blocked. Just 15 minutes per day. Seeing my apps being blocked made me realize how much of my time I have been spending on autopilot. Feeling bored? Open an app.
I evaluated which social media actually brought value to my life. And I considered Instagram to not be one of them. And I decided to remove it from my phone. I almost never used it to see content from my friends and family. As the algorithm was pushing me creators I don&#x27;t follow. Why spend time on it?
I discovered a plugin for Youtube called Unhook. It removes all recommendations, autoplay, homepage, e…</span>

In this post I will explain what closures are using examples as well so that you too can use them to write your code better.
Before directly explaining what closures are, it is appropriate to explain the concept of scope and lexical scope.
The scope of a function refers that area of code where its variables are &quot;visible&quot; and can be used.
scope chain.
Lexical scope, also called static scope, refers to when the location of a function&#x27;s definition determines which variables you have access to.
E.g. :
const life &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
  const pastEvents &#x3D; &#x27;past&#x27;

  //console.log(actualEvents) this will create an error because that inner variable is not accesible here

  const present &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {    
    const actualEvents &#x3D; &#x27;present&#x27;

    console.log(pastEvents, …</span>

Given the flaky nature of these end-to-end automation tests, most of the teams design some sort of alerting mechanism to get notified when there are test failures.
Communication platforms like slack or microsoft teams are becoming the new graveyard for these alerts as most engineers end-up ignoring them over a period of time. The primary reasons for ignoring these alerts are
Excess Alerts
Lack of Visibility
Poor Accountability

                              <span>九年前，也是这个上午，我创建了 LCTT 及其第一个项目 TranslateProject。从最初只是有感于 Unix/Linux 上的中文手册页实在太糟糕，希望做一些事情；到最后变成了一个以翻译国外各个开源社区的技术文章和开源资讯/讨论的“流水”式项目，LCTT 已经走过了令我自己都非常吃惊的九年。

人的一生，几十年而已，能在一件事上持续投入九年时光，这是我从未想过的事情。驻足回望，LCTT 其实并没有完成我最初的想法，这是缺憾；但是 LCTT 就这样变成了另外一种并非在我计划中的样子，或许也有其必然性。现在看来，LCTT 做了一些事情，也有一些存在的意义。我试着总结一下：

LCTT 的主项目 TranslateProject，选题广泛，参与门槛低，从某种意义上，为初识开源的小伙伴提供一种成为开源贡献者的方式。一些人就是通过这个项目，迈出了成为开源贡献者的第一步，并在日后的学习和工作中，成为了开源爱好者、专业技术人员。

LCTT 持续翻译了数千篇（截至今日，已经翻译发布了 6395 篇文章），这些文章的专业程度横跨了入门到精通等不同难度，内容方向涉猎了开发、运维、使用和文化等各个方面。虽然，有些文章仅堪一读，但也有不少文章值得收藏、一再细读。我屡屡能从读者那里得到反馈，这些文章对他们提供了很大的帮助，我想这就是 LCTT 的存世价值之一吧。唯独可惜的是，这些文章，没有以很好的方式组织起来，甚憾。

LCTT 有数百成员（截至今日，成功地在仓库中进行了贡献的贡献者有 311 位），他们的年龄不等，最年轻的有初中的学生、最老的，嗯这个不需要说了；他们的职业各异，比较多的是大学生，也有很多从事技术工作的专业人员，甚至还有完全不从事技术工作的贡献者。但是，他们都有一个共同的身份就是 LCTT 贡献者，因此，他们都有很多开源兄弟姐妹。

There was a time when 5 MB was the reasonable maximum size for an email attachment. Today, it&#x27;s easily possible for a single photo to be 5 MB. Accordingly, the maximum attachment size has increased to, say, 25 MB. But of course file sizes are getting bigger and bigger too, and so eventually the attachment limit will go up too. It&#x27;s an endless cycle, common in the digital world: the tools are built for today&#x27;s data, and today&#x27;s data increases in complexity and size until the tools are revised and improved. You have to contain data, preferably in the smallest packaging possible, so that sharing it online goes faster for everyone. Here are five ways to optimize images for the Internet.

我们总是看到这样的例子——当一家软件公司开始做大做强，用户量飞速上涨之后，他们的产品往往就走向一条不可挽回的庞杂之路。开发团队试图用更多的新功能和更大的饼圈住更多用户，越来越臃肿的界面和逐渐扩充的体积也让用着老设备的用户更加痛苦。
不过大厂也并非所有产品都如此不堪，总有一些优质应用，因为顶着「大厂」的帽子让用户望而却步。这篇文章就简单介绍几个由头部开发商开发的小应用，希望这些好产品能得到它们应有的认识。
微软数学：你手机里的数学老师
平台：iOS / Android / 网页

微软数学是一款用来求解数学方程式的 App——但它不止于此。通过拍照、手写或者是键盘输入待求解的方程式，它不仅可以帮你求出结果，还可以查看详细求解过程，必要时还会附加图片，再也不怕答案里的「略」。
书签、历史记录功能都很完善，App 还提供了测验功能，可以根据运算过的方程式生成类似的题目，帮助你巩固知识点。详细的功能我们在之前的 App+1 文章中有过介绍，如果你常常被数学困扰，微软数学可以让你的学习之路更加轻松。此外，Edge 浏览器已经内置了微软数学，你可以在打开含有数学公式的页面时尝试这一功能。
Layout：快捷图像拼贴工具
平台：iOS / Android

Layout 是一款用来拼接图片的 App，开发者是当时推出了多款独立图像编辑应用的 Instagram。Layout 功能简单，操作也很直观，选择图片与给定的拼接模板即可。不过在 Facebook（Meta）再次改变策略后，这些独立应用又都纷纷整合回了 Instagram。2020 年 Instagram 上推出的 Layout 功能就是这款 App 的延伸。
Layout 上次更新停留在 2018 年末，但其体积小巧，功能粗暴，成图迅…</span>

If you’re the kind of person who’s always dropping your phone, AppleCare Plus may have just become a much better deal. As MacRumors points out, the service now covers “unlimited repairs for accidental damage protection.” According to an archived version of the AppleCare Plus page from last month, you used to be limited to “two incidents of accidental damage protection every 12 months.” 
Before you toss your phone in the air in celebration, though, do note that the service fees and deductibles are still around — a screen or back glass repair will cost $29, while “other accidental damage” will run you $99. Also, Apple’s fine print clearly notes that the damage has to be caused by “unexpected and unintentional events” to fall under...

Elon Musk has sent a third letter to Twitter attempting to terminate his $44 billion acquisition of the company. Musk’s legal team cited Twitter’s multimillion dollar severance payment to former security chief and whistleblower Peiter Zatko as a violation of the merger agreement and a reason to end the deal. The letter, dated September 9th, was sent to Twitter’s chief legal officer Vijaya Gadde, and was included in a filing Twitter made with the SEC on Friday (which you can read at the bottom of this article). 
Last month, Zatko made headlines by accusing Twitter of misleading investors about the number of bots on the service, failing to delete users’ data, and having poor security practices, among other things. Musk jumped on the...

If something’s broken with your Steam Deck and you don’t want to try to fix it yourself, Valve now has a new option for you: you can send your handheld gaming PC to one of the company’s new repair centers to get it fixed. 
Repairs for anything that’s covered by the Steam Deck’s warranty (which is one year in the US) will be free, Valve says. If your device is out of warranty, the company will offer to fix it up for a cost. If you don’t want to pay that fee, you can decline the repair and ask to have your Steam Deck sent back.
This out of warranty paid repair service is completely optional, and if you want to repair your Deck yourself (via @iFixit parts and guides, for instance), that&#x27;s up to you! More details here: h...

Apple is delaying the release of iOS 16’s iCloud Shared Photo Library feature, saying it’s “coming later this year” instead of when the mobile operating system refresh launches on September 12th (via AppleInsider). An archived version of the iOS 16 webpage shows the notice about the delay was added sometime this week.
When it does launch, the feature will let you and up to five other people automatically share a collection of photos, with the option of including all the photos in your personal library, photos from after a specific date, or that include specific people. 


It’s not particularly unusual for Apple to withhold features from the initial release — last year, iOS 15 launched without SharePlay, Universal Control, and better Find...

Disney just wrapped up its Disney and Marvel Games Showcase at D23, and the event was packed with news and announcements about games from the entertainment company’s many franchises. The show was a lightning-fast deluge of trailers for a wide variety of games, including titles that are out right now, like Disney Dreamlight Valley, and ones that are a bit farther off.
Here’s a rundown of some of the biggest news from the show. And if you want to watch the 23-minute showcase in full, you can catch it on Marvel’s YouTube channel.

If you can believe it, Instagram is testing a new feature that mimics other social networks. TechCrunch reports Instagram confirmed tests of “reposts” to bring someone else’s content onto your own timeline. It’s similar to Twitter’s retweets or the kind of reshares that are common on Tumblr and Facebook and are also in testing on TikTok. 
TechCrunch writes the “repost” feature was spotted by Matt Navarra, a social media consultant who posted images in a Twitter thread on Wednesday. However, Alessandro Paluzzi noticed it in development back in May, showing Instagram has been working on it for a while.

One of the new features of iOS 16, and something that was again highlighted during Apple’s event on Wednesday, is personalized spatial audio. Once you’ve installed the latest iOS release on your iPhone beginning September 12th, you’ll be able to create a custom sound profile that should improve the sense of immersion and overall spatial audio experience you get from AirPods.
To produce this personalized tuning, Apple uses the iPhone’s front-facing TrueDepth camera to scan your ears. The process, which involves holding your iPhone about 10 to 20 centimeters from the side of your head, takes under a minute, and the resulting data is then used to optimize spatial audio for your unique ear shape. “The way we all perceive sound is unique,...

President Joe Biden traveled to Ohio on Friday to celebrate the groundbreaking of Intel’s new $20 billion semiconductor plant, one of the first domestic chip-making facilities to come out of the recently passed CHIPS and Science Act.
Intel’s Friday groundbreaking ceremony kicked off construction of what the company has called the “largest silicon manufacturing location on the planet.” It’s part of Intel’s plans to invest $100 billion in Ohio over the next 10 years. The company has said that the project could take more than 7,000 workers to build the facility that is expected to house two separate factories and, once finished, employ 3,000 workers. 
“We need to make these chips right here in America to bring down everyday costs and create...

On October 2nd, the TV adaptation of Interview with the Vampire will debut on AMC Plus, and it’s got a new trailer. It further highlights the big departures from the source material and features the exquisite torment of the show’s protagonist, vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac. 
This is the second trailer for Interview, and it presents a luxurious and sumptuous tale centered on desire, seduction, and, ultimately, betrayal. 
In this adaptation, Louis de Pointe du Lac (Jacob Anderson) is a Black entrepreneur in 1910s New Orleans. The trailer hops between Louis’ memories of the past and the present day, in which he spills his guts to Daniel Molloy, a journalist played by Eric Bogosian. Louis tells Daniel his tale about being hunted by the...

                              <span>@alexdanilowicz and I came up with this idea in college when we were debating who texted their girlfriends more. We built a MVP, posted it on Reddit, and went viral. Our MVP was a web version, so people were hesitant to use the product because of privacy and security concerns. We went back to the drawing board...

Today, we&#x27;re thrilled to release Left on Read as an open-source Mac Desktop App: Github Repo

In addition to unique analytics about your texting habits, we&#x27;re also exploring productivity tooling such as response reminders and scheduling messages ⏰. (Better search coming soon!)

Our vision is to build a fast and feature-rich iMessage client that can enhance our daily experience on iMessage (and tell us how many ❤️ emojis we send).

We’ll be spending the day here to answer any questions and collect feedback!

Happy Analyzing!

                              <span>Fedora 37 将于下个月发布。让我们来看看它带来的变化。




最好的 Linux 发行版之一的升级版，Fedora 37，即将面世。它将在下个月发布，如果一切按计划进行，它最早将于 2022 年 10 月 18 日发布。而测试版应该在 2022 年 9 月 13 日发布。

让我重点介绍一些你可能想关注的 Fedora 37 重要功能。

Fedora 37 功能



Fedora 37 带有最新的 GNOME 桌面以及其他完善的功能。这些包括：

1、GNOME 43



GNOME 43 和其他一些技术改进将在 Fedora 37 中首次亮相。所以，看看它的体验如何应该是很令人感兴趣的。

这是一次旨在提高用户体验的实质性升级。GNOME 43 中的标志性的重要改进包括一个新的快速切换菜单和 对 Nautilus 文件管理器的改变。



此外，其他一些重要的变化还有：


GNOME Web 浏览器对 WebExtensions 的支持。

文件管理器中新的文档上下文菜单。

GNOME “软件”的改进。


2、Linux 内核 5.19



Linux 内核 5.19 是一个有用的更新，它改进了对 ARM SoC 的支持、英特尔的 Arc GPU 支持，以及对 RISC-V 架构支持的一些调整。

你可以查看 Linux 内核 5.19 的变化列表 来了解更多。

3、桌面环境更新

虽然 GNOME 43 是 Fedora 的旗舰桌面环境，但你也可以找到带有 KDE Plasma 5.26、Xfce 4.16 和 MATE 1.24 的 Fedora 升级版。

在这些版本中，鉴于 KDE Plasma 桌面的一系列改进，带有 KDE Plasma 5.26 的 Fedora 37 也是一个不错的选择。

你可以在我们之前的报道中阅读更多 关于 KDE Plasma 5.26 版本的信息。

不要忘记，你也可以看到一个 新的 Budgie 桌面的 Fedora 定制版。

截至目前，桌面、控制中心、屏幕保护程序和桌面视图的软件包都已经出现在 Fedora 的软件包源。所以，我想你可以期待它们出现在 Fedora 37 的发布中。

4、树莓派 4 支持

Fedora 支持树莓派，但不支持树莓派 4。

在 Fedora 37 中，由于对较新的 Linux 内核和 Mesa（图形加速）的上游改进，它 正式引入了对树莓派 4 的支持。

这些变化也应该使 Fedora 37 在树莓派 3 系列和 Zero 2 W 上有更好的体验。

5、实验性的基于 Web 界面的安装程序

Fedora 37 将是第一个为其 Anaconda 安装程序 提供基于网页的用户界面的版本。

换句话说，这是对其当前安装程序的重新设计。请注意，在本次发布之后，它将只作为一个额外的预览镜像提供。

你可以单独下载它并进行实验。到现在为止，我们还不能试用它。所以，你需要在预览镜像可用后再去试试它。

其他变化和新的默认壁纸



对于 Fedora 37，除了可以期待很多技术上的改进，不要忘了，它还有一个新的壁纸，有浅色/深色的变体。上图显示了 Fedora 37 的深色壁纸。

浅色变体可以在本文的开头看到。

Fedora 37 的其他变化包括：




Fedora CoreOS 将被确认为 Fedora 的主要版本之一。

Fedora Cloud 将被列为官方版本之一。

GNU Emacs 28 更新。

用于 Fedora 服务器的新 KVM 镜像。


你可以参考 官方的 Fedora 37 更新日志 了解更多技术细节。

                              <span>如果你在笔记本电脑上使用 Ubuntu，你可能已经注意到当你合上盖子时系统处于挂起状态。

这是预期的行为。它可以节省电池和你的工作。你掀开盖子，系统唤醒，你可以登录并继续工作。

这一切听起来都不错，除非你使用多显示器设置。像我这样的一些人更喜欢关闭笔记本电脑，只使用外接显示器。

但是，如果关闭笔记本电脑盖会挂起系统，那么会产生问题。

让我告诉你如何改变这种行为。

关闭笔记本电脑盖时不要挂起

实际上，我注意到最近的 Ubuntu 版本在这个情况下更智能。当笔记本电脑连接到扩展坞并合上盖子时，它不会进入挂起模式。

这是正常的预期行为，但由于 Ubuntu 某种神才知道的原因，它可能不会一直有效。

好消息是你可以使用 GUI 和命令行强制更改此行为。

让我分享这两种方法。

方法 1：使用 GNOME 优化

如果你使用的是默认的 GNOME 桌面，那么你很幸运。 在 Ubuntu 的软件中心安装 GNOME 优化（Tweaks）工具，或使用以下命令：

sudo apt install gnome-tweaks


安装后，启动优化应用。在侧边栏的常规General选项卡中，关闭“笔记本电脑盖合上时挂起Suspend when laptop lid is closed”按钮。



这就好了。你不需要重启即可使更改生效。

现在，让我们谈谈命令行方法。

方法 2：更改登录配置（针对高级用户）

如果你查看文件 /etc/systemd/logind.conf 的内容，你将看到三种不同类型的笔记本电脑合盖默认设置：


HandleLidSwitch&#x3D;suspend：当笔记本电脑使用电池供电时，合盖挂起

HandleLidSwitchExternalPower&#x3D;suspend：当笔记本电脑插入电源插座时，合盖挂起

HandleLidSwitchDocked&#x3D;ignore：当笔记本电脑连接到扩展坞时，合盖忽略




如你所见，如果合上盖子，笔记本电脑将挂起，无论它是否连接到电源。而连接扩展坞忽略合盖。

如果需要，你可以根据自己的喜好将这些参数的值更改为其中之一：


suspend：合盖时挂起

lock：合盖时锁定

ignore：什么都不做

poweroff：关机

hibernate：合盖时休眠


如果你不希望你的系统在笔记本电脑盖合上时执行任何特殊操作，我建议你使用 ignore。

你可以编辑 /etc/systemd/logind.conf 文件，或者在 /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d 目录中创建一个新文件，并取消注释上述设置并更改其值。如果此目录不存在，请创建此目录。

我不会给你确切的命令。如果你熟悉命令行，你应该可以做到。如果你对命令行感到不习惯，请使用前面的 GUI 方法。

我希望这可以帮助你。如果你有任何问题，请告诉我。

谷歌鼓励开源社区对代码进行模糊测试

谷歌在 2016 年推出了社区模糊测试服务（OSS-Fuzz）以应对心脏流血漏洞，目前已经检查了大约 700 个关键开源项目的漏洞。模糊测试，是一种软件测试技术，试图通过向软件注入随机或半随机数据来发现错误。谷歌的开源安全团队表示，OSS-Fuzz 已经帮助修复了开源项目中的 8000 多个安全漏洞和 26000 个其他错误。他们鼓励开源社区参与该项目，如果在该项目中发现至少两个以前未发现的漏洞，将获得一万多美元的奖励。

中科大发 4 万多封钓鱼邮件，约 10% 的人中招

近日，有中国科学技术大学的学生在社交平台发文称，收到了“中秋免费月饼领取”的邮件，但填写资料后却没有领到月饼。校方表示，这其实是一次官方的钓鱼邮件演练。此次演练共向全校师生发送模拟钓鱼邮件 4.5 万多封，并在邮件中故意留了明显的错误。但截至 9 月 8 日上午，共有 3500 多人在伪造的身份认证界面提交了信息。中科大公布的数据显示，2022 年 1 月至 8 月，该校邮件服务器有 921 个账号被窃取密码发送垃圾邮件，平均每天近 4 个账号。

引子
2016年秋季发布会
开头的这段演讲来自于 2019 年的苹果秋季发布会，Tim 在台上说，在苹果创办的这 40 年里，教育深深的植入进了苹果的 DNA。其实回想一下历年来苹果对外的发言，对 DNA 的表述一直是非常谨慎和克制的，尽管苹果做了许多成功的产品，但你很少会听到什么东西构成了苹果的 DNA，在我的印象中只有两个，乔布斯当年说苹果要始终走在科技和人文的交叉口，这算是一个，而 Tim 口中的教育，则是另一个。而今天这期苹果护城河的视频，我们就来聊聊教育。
坦率来说这个话题其实很早就进入了我们的选题库当中，甚至早于创建这个频道，很早之前我跟零号喝酒的时候就聊起过，你作为一个从业者，是没有办法去忽视苹果在这方面的成就的，但同时我们也知道，这注定不是一个迎合流量的选题，客观上来说，教育这个产品的目标用户不是我，可能也不是看视频的你，做这个选题是很有风险的一件事，有可能费了很大的劲，最后数据非常差。但我后来想清楚了，既然说教育是苹果的 DNA，那我们不妨就看看苹果在教育领域都做了什么，从这些动作和体验的细节上，我们也许就能知道，苹果为何而苹果，他到底哪里不一样。这期视频没有竞品分析，可能在一些细分领域苹果还有一些对手，但把苹果所有的投入放在一起时，尤其在国内的大环境下，苹果其实是没有竞品的，这是苹果真正的护城河。那让我们正式开始。
人人能创造

我们从苹果官网开始，把官网拉到最下面看索引的部分，可以很清晰的看到五列，代表苹果在国内的所有业务，其中第四列全部都是 to B 的商业业务，这里你就能看到 Apple 与教育的入口。打开之后你就能看到教育业务线有三个分支——基础教育、高等教育和高校学生。

我先来给大家简单说几句后面两个，这两个大家应该是非常熟悉的。高校学生这个，就是大家最熟悉的教育优惠，页面当中会比较详细的介绍利用苹果产品和配套的 app 都可…</span>

                              <span>本文写于 iPhone 14 Pro 发布当日，会在后续考虑对一些过时的内容进行更新，如有谬误欢迎指正。
在 2022 年，智能手机显然不再是一个噱头十足的产品类别了。但在 Apple 的下一个重大产品类别「Reality」AR 眼镜出现前（或者说成熟前），iPhone 仍然是 Apple 需要全力以赴迭代以吸引消费者更新的产品。而 iPhone 14 Pro 的有趣之处在于：纵然它的硬件特性和我在发布会前预知的几乎完全吻合，我却从发布会前的「不太考虑购入」变成了「计划购入」。

能制造这样的反差，说明其主要吸引力不止硬件特性，而是在各种无法被硬件特性所囊括的设计与解决方案里。
事实上，硬件特性和其吸引力的相关程度低，是大部分高端产品的共性。而落实到 iPhone 14 Pro 这个产品上，影响其吸引力最重要的便是交互设计与软硬件协同、为专业用户设计解决方案的能力，以及能让它在部分方面「不思进取」的资本。通过今天这篇文章，我想分享一下在 iPhone 14 Pro 发布之后的一些杂思，围绕「iPhone 14 Pro 对我们设计『高端产品』的启示」展开。
注：这些杂思中可能有一部分我在曾经讲过类似的观点。然而，想到互联网的随机性让我们每次的表达能触及和启发不同的人，便觉得适当重提一些观点也无大碍（甚至不介意日后继续这样做），看过我此前作品的读者还请多多包涵。
1. 交互设计与软硬件协同
iPhone 14 Pro 上最吸引眼球的便是 Dynamic Island（灵动岛）这个设计。这个设计甚至让我产生了这样的想法：「如果未来的 iPhone 在实现完全的全面屏后、这个设计被取消，我大概会产生类似对 3D Touch 的一点不舍」。

在我看来，从 iPhone 14 Pro 开始，Apple 事实上已经实现了「概念层面的无边泳池」。从 iPhone X 开始，全面屏的界面有…</span>

It&#x27;s been a little over a year since I wrote my article on Opensource.com, introducing the Cube community. As I worked with our community members and other vendors, I&#x27;ve become more convinced of the benefits of open source in data analytics. I also think it&#x27;s good to remind ourselves periodically why open source matters and how it provides long-term benefits for everyone.
Benefits of open source for users and customers
One of the first things I heard from the Cube community was that they often received better support in chat from other community members than they did with proprietary software and a paid support plan. Across many open source communities, I find people who are motivated to help o…</span>

日本作为工业强国之一，其文具产业量成熟而发达，诸多文具品牌都有百年以上的品牌历史，从早期的仿制和借鉴，到如今堪称原创程度极高、做工精巧细致、设计富有灵感和生活趣味，外观符合现代审美，因而被大家所深深喜欢。
本篇将从品牌+代表现产产品介绍两方面，来和大家详细讲讲日系文具的趣味与实用属性。
国誉

国誉是一家综合的办公类设备供应商，创立于1905年，有极其丰富的文具产品生产线和办公家具产品供应。创始人黑田善太郎先生以封面纸起家，逐步发展成大型纸质品品牌，进而扩展到其它类别文具和家具行业。近年来也收购了多家国内企业，在我国建厂生产文具产品。
购买国誉，还是要以他们的纸品、本册最为代表！
国誉活页本

国誉的活页本堪称是头号招牌，也是率先把活页本灵活收纳+书写的概念引入国内的学生群体，活页结构耐用，多种封面可选，后期还有不硌手的活页结构推出，非常成熟的代表作。

除了结构上的优势，国誉Campus的内页纸质也是非常优秀的存在，设计有不同划线、结构的内页，并且日本进口原纸可能完美双面书写hold住钢笔。
国誉Campus笔记本

不习惯使用活页本的话，可以选择Campus系列下的笔记本，同样使用进口原纸，书写感受和活页本等同，完全hold住各种墨水~
需要注意不要买成国誉子品牌Gambol系列，那个完全国产，虽然价格低，但不如Campus。
国誉自我手账

除了日用向的本子，国誉的自我手账是简易入手账坑的不错产品，有简约耐看的外皮和丰富的内页，可以很好得记录生活~
每年一本，价格不贵~
国誉对开笔袋

极简设计的国誉笔袋也是品牌的热门款，拉链质感非常出色，设计简约耐看，适合中学生和办公一族！除了基础款，国誉还有些立式变形笔袋，基本都可以做到好用且耐用，值得推荐！
国誉空气弹力剪刀

国誉的这款剪刀也是站内神器之一，刃口锋利而耐用，所谓空气弹力是在握持位置增加了两个内握柄，使用感…</span>

                              <span>@Anes and I started esims.io as a side project after using an eSIM for the first time and thinking how crazy it was to be able to &quot;download a SIM card&quot;. We are convinced eSIM, aka &quot;embedded SIM&quot; is the technology that will lead to the end of crazy roaming fees and long waits at the airport sim card shop.

With the iPhone 14 announced as the first eSIM only iPhone, we&#x27;re happy to release esims.io. We offer a powerful yet simple experience for anyone that needs a travel eSIM: we aggregate 4000+ data plans from telecom providers in 200+ countries in our seamless comparison interface.

Here&#x27;s a highlight of some of esims.io&#x27;s best features so far: 
- Find plans by country, region, or with global coverage
- Multi-country search: search for data plans compatible in multiple countries 
- Price/GB: sort offers by how expensive is a gigabyte of data
- Filtering options: select how much data you need, and for how long
- Currency conversions: local plans priced in local currencies are converted to the user&#x27;s preferred currency
- Multi-lingual experience: you should not have to speak english to stay connected while traveling: we&#x27;re solving this trough our multi-lingual interface

What&#x27;s coming-up:
- More supported languages
- Buying eSIM plans directly from our website
- A refresh of our mobile Apps

Thank you for checking us out ! We are of course welcoming feedback.

If you have an idea for a tattoo but can&#x27;t find the right design, let our AI generate one within seconds. It lets you create the perfect design based on what you like, and it will give you unlimited options so that there&#x27;s something for everyone.

Give it a spin. And if you don&#x27;t have time, go check out the Explore page to see what others created.✨

I&#x27;m absolutely shocked by how powerful text2image is.

But, just like how GPT-3 helped copywriters/marketing be more effective, SD/DALL-E is going to be a game changer for artists!

                              <span>如果你希望自动执行常规任务并使你的生活更轻松，那么使用 Shell 脚本是一个很好的选择。本文将向你介绍一些基本概念，这些概念将帮助你编写高效的 Shell 脚本。




Shell 脚本是一种被设计用来运行命令行解释器 UNIX Shell 的计算机程序。Shell 脚本的各类变种被视作脚本语言。Shell 脚本执行的典型操作包括文件操作、程序执行和文本打印。设置环境、运行程序并执行任何必要的清理或日志记录的脚本称为封装。

识别 Shell 命令提示符

你可以通过查看终端窗口中的提示符符号来识别 Linux 系统的计算机上的 Shell 命令提示符的用户是普通用户还是超级用户。# 符号用于超级用户，$ 符号用于具有标准权限的用户。

基本命令

脚本附带了很多可以在终端窗口上执行的、用以管理您的计算机的命令。每个命令的详细信息可以在该命令附带的使用手册中找到。你可以使用如下命令来查看手册：

man 


一些常用的命令有：

date # 显示当前日期和时间
cal # 显示当前月份日历
df # 显示磁盘使用情况
free # 显示内存使用情况
ls # 列出文件和目录
mkdir # 创建目录


每个命令都附带了几个可以一起使用的选项。你可以参考使用手册以了解更多的细节。man date 的输出如图 1 所示。



重定向操作符

当你希望捕获文件中的命令输出或重定向到文件时，可以使用重定向操作符。




命令
描述




ls -l /usr/bin &gt;file
默认标准输出到文件


ls -l /usr/bin 2&gt;file
重定向标准错误到文件


ls -l /usr/bin &gt; ls-output 2&gt;&amp;1
重定向标准错误和标准输出到文件

欧盟的人工智能法案可能对开源产生寒蝉效应

2021 年，欧盟发布了《人工智能法案》草案以征求意见。据该草案，开源开发者必须遵守风险管理、数据治理、技术文件和透明度的准则，以及准确性和网络安全的标准。一些专家在一项新的研究中警告说，这可能会限制产生 GPT-3 等尖端人工智能工具的研究类型的发展。如果一家公司部署的开源人工智能系统导致了一些灾难性的结果，不难想象该公司可能会试图通过起诉他们建立产品的开源开发者来转移责任。这可能会进一步将控制人工智能未来的权力集中在大型技术公司。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：开源开发就是“按原样”提供，既不应该承担额外的责任，也不能承担这些责任，否则个人开发者谁会去贡献，谁敢去贡献？




PHP 8.2 发布了第一个候选版本

在过去的几个月里，经过一系列的 alpha 和 beta 版本，PHP 8.2 的第一个候选版本出来了。PHP 8.2 RC1 带来了各种错误的修复，包括可能的崩溃修复，PHP CLI 的内置 Web 服务器也对处理静态资源进行了各种改进。更多发布细节请参考发布公告。在未来的几周内，预计至少还有五个候选版本，而 PHP 8.2.0 的 GA 版本预计在 11 月 24 日左右。

                              <span>我们经常对比 Linux 和 Windows，那 macOS 和 Linux 有什么区别呢？

Linux 和 Windows 的差异很明显，但 Linux 和 macOS 在很多人看起来却很相似。

二者都可以在命令行中运行 Unix 命令，并且与用户在 Windows 中的体验大相径庭。同时，并不是所有 Windows 上的应用和游戏可以在 macOS 和Linux 上运行。

这就是为什么一些人认为苹果公司的 macOS 是基于 Linux 的系统。但事实并非如此。 尽管有相似之处，但 macOS 并不是 Linux。

这两个类 Unix 的操作系统有很多不同之处，我将在这篇文章中指出二者的异同之处。

就让我们来比较一下苹果和橙子企鹅吧。

起源

macOS 有一段迷人的历史。它的基础是由史蒂夫·乔布斯的 NeXT 计算机公司所开发的，那时候乔布斯不在苹果公司工作。从技术上讲，它是基于 Mach 内核 和 Unix 派生的 BSD。

那时候，NeXT 开发了 NeXTSTEP 操作系统来驱动它设计的设备和电脑。虽然它得到了一些关注，但是它并没有大获成功。之后，苹果公司恢复了史蒂夫在董事会的席位，作为交易的一部分，收购了 NeXT 公司，使得 NeXTSTEP 操作系统成为了 macOS 的基础。

这就是为什么 macOS 是结合了 Unix 组件和苹果公司的专有技术的操作系统。

相反，Linux（内核）是 Unix 的自由并开源的替代品。

Linux 不是一个操作系统，它需要一些组件比如 桌面环境 才能成为一个操作系统。有许多 基于 Linux 的操作系统，称之为发行版。

简单起见，我们将这些操作系统称为 Linux 操作系统而不是特定的发行版。

                              <span>工作区是组织工作的好方法。

假设你打开了太多应用。你的任务栏会很混乱，你可能很难在不同的程序之间查找/移动。

在这种情况下，工作区会派上用场。你可以对不同工作区中的应用进行分组。假设你打开了许多与编程相关的应用，而同时你也在处理文档。

你可以将它们组织在单独的工作区中。单击并拖动应用窗口，它应该显示将应用移动到不同工作区的选项。

这将以更有条理的方式简化你的工作，并节省一些时间和挫败感。

听起来不错？让我向你展示如何在带 Cinnamon 桌面环境的 Linux Mint 中创建工作区并在它们之间切换。

创建新工作区

在 Linux Mint 中创建或访问工作区很容易。只需按 CTRL + ALT+ ↑。它将向你显示如下所示的屏幕。

只需单击右侧的 + 号即可在默认的 4 个工作区之外添加的新工作区。



Linux Mint 中的工作区是持久的。创建后，这些工作区将始终存在，即使在下次启动后也是如此。

在工作区之间切换

有两种方法可以访问工作区并在它们之间切换。


使用 CTRL + ALT+ ↑，将显示出所有工作区，然后使用箭头键或鼠标在它们之间移动。

使用热角并在左上角移动鼠标。


默认情况下，最新版本的 Linux Mint 中禁用了热角功能。

要启用热角在工作区之间切换，你应该进入 系统设置System Settings 并选择 热角Hot Corners 选项。



现在，通过切换按钮启用左上角。默认情况下，此角专用于显示所有工作区（你也可以更改它）。



你现在可以通过将鼠标悬停在左上角来访问工作区网格。

此外，如果需要，你可以按右侧的 + 符号添加新工作区。或根据需要通过单击名称来重命名现有工作区。



删除工作区

实际上，你可以通过单击 + 号来创建多个工作区。如果你想删除工作区，请将鼠标悬停在该工作区上，单击工作区右上角的 X 号。



我希望这篇快速文章能帮助你在 Linux Mint 中创建工作区。你经常使用工作空间吗？让我们知道你对工作空间的看法。同时，你还可以查看 安装 Linux Mint 20 后要做的事情 的帖子。

                              <span>历史长河的锚点
近段期间《梦华录》热播，我在豆瓣上看到网友“黄小胖”吐槽说，“感觉《梦华录》的制作方确实不完全理解北宋官制。”比如顾千帆的父亲说“你十八岁中进士，要是好好干，现在也是个翰林学士了。”事实上翰林学士官职极高，30岁左右的顾千帆正常情况下距离翰林学士还有很远的距离。
《梦华录》
同样的，顾千帆“兴平军节度使，参知政事，知苏州事”的父亲，这个“知苏州事”并不一定主政苏州。顾千帆父亲的历史原型可能是丁谓，有一段时间官名为持节苏州诸军事，苏州刺史，这些都不是实际岗位，都是他实际官名平江军节度使的自然延伸。换言之，丁谓当时应该在南京工作，而不是苏州。
这名网友后来也感叹说：“《梦华录》的编剧就和我们这些普通观众一样，没有明白北宋阶官的制度，望文生义，认为苏州刺史就是苏州的官员，皇城副使就是皇城司的领导。这也是难免的，感觉只有专业人才能弄明白。”这名网友曾经对北宋奇特的官制产生了兴趣，在豆瓣友邻的鼓励下断断续续读了一些科普书籍。那么问题来了，有哪些能打通两宋与当下，专业与科普的书籍呢？或许《在田野看见宋朝》就是其中一本。包伟民先生在本书引言中，就诚恳地认为学术研究应当“走出‘专业’的圈子，以使历史知识能够走近更多的读者”。
《在田野看见宋朝》，包伟民等著，浙江古籍出版社2022年8月出版。图源：浙江古籍出版社微信公众号
就我个人而言，这本书之所以吸引我，在于提供了历史长河的锚点。这锚点，可以是距离我家不远的忠亭，可以是我多次穿越而过的鼓楼，可以是陆游的“深巷明朝卖杏花”，也可以是王安石在鄞县（今宁波）的新政实验。刘成国先生评价王安石时说：“所谓参天之木，必有其根；怀山之水，必有其源。”今天杭州背后的江南韵味、世代匠心，很大程度上来自两宋，而我们借助“锚点”回望两宋，也自有一股独特趣味。

                              <span>大部分的官方路由固件是功能、驱动固化后编译出来的，那自然缺点也很明显，很多第三方插件能提供的内容就不能用；饿，个人如果想要通过路由器实现更多功能和玩法，就只能借助于类似OpenWRT、Padavan这些第三方开源固件了。OpenWRT的框架化设计和包管理模式使用户有了完全的定制能力，国内很多软路由固件也都是基于OpenWRT深度开发的。

为了解决内网设备的各种需求，就需要这些插件来支持了。我们有两种方法：第一个是主路由更换为软路由或者支持开源固件的硬路由；另一个就是添加一台支持开源固件的路由器，将其作为旁路路由使用。不过现在是千兆接入，一个支持2.5G及以上WAN口的旗舰硬路由，价格完全够搞台软路由的价格了，所以添置旁路路由是更合算过渡方案。

1.第一次升级：两台硬路由的旁路由化尝试
这次选择了GL.inet的两台支持OpenWRT的小路由：MT1300和SFT1200。SFT1200算是MT1300的SoC国产化后的一个低配版，二者使用了同样的模具设计，仅有颜色不同。

所以二者的一致性还是很高的，同样都是一个千兆WAN口、两个千兆LAN口，有一个USB-A接口，同样都通过USB-C接口供电。

不过SFT1200精简掉了网口的指示灯，并且USB-A的规格也降到了2.0，供电接口同样是使用的USB-C。

另外就是SFT1200取消了TF卡槽，只能够通过USB接口进行存储扩展。MT1300的插槽标注支持128G，实测200G的卡的还是可以正确识别的。

另一侧的模式选择与Reset按键，没有进行改动，二者这侧没有区别。

在外观以外，MT1300的处理器是联发科MT7261A，32+256MB配置；SFT1200的处理器是矽昌SF19A2890，双128配置。不过二者差价在百元左右，这些差异倒也可以接受。

上电待路由器完全启动后，我们就可以连接对应的Wi-Fi了。M…</span>

                              <span>我前几天无聊在刷哔哩哔哩的时候，看到一个很吸引人的标题「充电，拓展，储存一步到位」，点进去看原来是一家创业公司 X-STATION 发布了一个名字叫「Cyberize 玲珑坞」充电头。看完宣传片后我直呼好家伙，表面上是 GaN 氮化镓 65W 快充头，背地里却偷偷给你最高 1TB 存储，还附带拓展坞和 HDMI 投屏功能，这是什么周星驰行为？
我平时就喜欢折腾一些奇奇怪怪的东西，这玩意儿还能解决出门带上一堆乱七八糟东西的麻烦，自然跑不掉我的欲（划掉）愿望清单，赶紧弄了个回来体验一下。在体验了一周多之后我想说：
坏消息 —— 是个缝合怪；
好消息 —— 全缝上了。

PS：先声明没有恰饭，纯粹是自己的体验，然后已经了解简单情况和基础参数的朋友，可以直接跳到后面的日常使用场景体验和玩法部分，看看有没有你心动的场景。

过一遍外观和简单参数
虽然说充电头也不太容易长成惊世骇俗的模样，但我们还是先来简单看看外观和一些参数。
我拿到手的配件非常简单，就充电头，收纳包还有一条线（买手机不送充电头，买充电头居然送收纳包，十分不环保哈哈），收纳包的质感非常像耳机收纳包，不能说毫不相干，只能说一模一样。
充电头和配件
首次上手玲珑坞给我的感觉就是很轻巧，居然比 OPPO 自带的快充头还轻，重量大概就和小米送的 30W 快充头差不多（99g）。而且大小也是很正常的充电头大小（663CM），仅仅比小米送的 30W 充电头大一点点，和普通 100W GaN 快充头差不多大小，要知道玲珑坞里面还塞了一个固态硬盘和 HDMI 头，这个体积和重量控制还是可以的。另外两个充电脚也是直角收纳设计，不像普通充电头还要突出两个充电脚，进一步减少体积方便收纳。
与不同充电头和固态硬盘大小的对比
另外玲珑坞还自带三个不同颜色的橡胶圈让你套在充电头中间，非常有效防止你财力雄厚买了很多个，然后不小心把装着老师作品的充电…</span>

我是一名今年九月份入学的计科硕士，虽然才入学几天，但是一些工具已经成为我日常学习，写作输出的一部分，硕士生涯的目标是尽可能发几篇论文，然后找个机会寻个大厂落脚，因此难免要看很多的书，很多的论文。
话虽如此，我使用各个软件的时间并不长，所以就按照熟悉程度做一个介绍与分享，以及我在使用的过程中遇到的痛点和爽点。

浏览器 Chrome
Chrome 算是我的浏览器终极选择，之前一直用的 Edge，尤其是在 Windows 上，从新版 Edge 推出到前几天，我一直是 Edge 的忠实粉丝，不过由于 macOS 的 bug，让我不得不放弃 Edge，转投邪恶势力 Chrome。
浏览器是信息最重要的输入接口，每天翻开电脑盖子的第一件事情就是打开浏览器，看看知乎热榜，看看 bilibili 的新动态以及 github 上是否有人给我点 star。其间要是遇到有趣的、有意义的文章我会通过各种剪辑插件将文章保存下来，例如 Cubox 插件和 Webclipper 插件。
Cubox 插件
这是网页收集箱软件 Cubox 提供的一个网页剪辑插件
Cubox
插件主要做了三件事：

将网页的网址保存到 Cubox
在本机深度抓取网页快照（这个功能相当好用，甚至可以抓取到知乎网页里的评论）
对收集的网页进行简单的分类和标注
Cubox 拓展
Webclipper 通用网页剪辑插件
这是一个开源的网页剪辑插件，所有数据都保存在本地，剪辑之后的网页可以分发到多个应用，包括思源笔记，为知笔记，flomo 等。
WebClipper
可以手动选取要抓取的区域，并导出为 markdown 格式的文件，且文章内的图片也可以通过图床设置上传。
对比与分类
一定有人会想，为什么需要两个网页剪辑软件，这难道不会分散注意力吗？
确实是这样的，但是我更坚信专门的软件做专门的事…</span>

Events are an essential component of open source community health. A positive event experience can inspire current contributors and encourage new ones. But how can you tell whether your events are successful?
We at the CHAOSS (Community Health Analytics Open Source Software) App Ecosystem Working Group have considered this question for our events to maintain the health of the communities involved. The CHAOSS App Ecosystem includes several projects focused on developing applications for the Linux platform. While currently dominated by the GNOME and KDE communities, it is not defined by them. The app ecosystem, as it stands today, is primarily driven by volunteers with altruistic go…</span>

几年前有写过用 Spicetify 修改 Spotify 桌面客户端主题的教程，这几天再次重新装上发现有了挺多大的改进：lyric-plus 支持了网易云和 MusixMatch 歌词；fullAppDisplay 也能实现优雅全屏的播放；安装简化了很多主题也更为丰富。目前的状态已经让我觉得十分好看好用了，就特地再写篇 Spicetify 的教程。
安装 Spicetify 客户端
Spotify 在 Linux、Mac、Windows 桌面端都是 CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework) 架构，这给对客户端修改的修改提升了很大的便利和可行性。Spicetify 则是一款开源免费强大能修改 Spotify 客户端的主题、添加插件的命令行工具。Spicetify 官网 有安装教程，这里也是以官网的教程作为参考的。
Mac 或 Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli/master/install.sh | sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spicetify/spicetify-marketplace/main/resources/install.sh | sh
复制命令在终端里执行就能完成安装。

我从8月26日晚上开始，持续高强度地体验了多天的须弥，并在30日晚上达成须弥目前开放地图100% 探索度，总探索40% 的目标，我感觉是时候来夸夸它了。

原神 3.0 如何？
原神截止到目前的发展来看，吸引人的点有哪些？
现在这个时间节点3.0值得入坑吗？

原神 3.0 如何？
瑕不掩瑜
原神这个游戏是什么？我相信各位肯定有着自己的判断，毕竟上线已经快要两年，而且持续不断地出圈，从最开始甚至到现在还引起玩家争论不已的抄袭论，到最近的联动引发各种抢眼球的新闻，海外诸多漫展持续不断的产出相关活动以及素材，这款游戏在不断有负面新闻产生的同时也说明了一件事，原神，确实有东西。
原神核心玩法在于大世界探索，收集宝箱，战斗主打元素反应，营收方式主要以gatcha 角色及武器抽卡为主。
从上海疫情封控结束后，米哈游的产能呈现了井喷式的态势，这一点从2.8的海岛可以很好的体现出来。
2.8版本持续约四十几天，可以体验的内容几乎相当于一个小品级游戏的体量，当然不排除这些东西都是2.6因疫情延迟，厚积薄发造成，关于这一点，需要再过几个版本来下评价。
此次活动主要为四个角色一人一个海岛地图，夹杂有各个角色为主题系列的任务，不重复，且很好的融入了各个角色的特点，进一步的补完了每个角色的人设，其中以皇女、辛焱为最。

皇女，即菲谢尔，直观的一个二次元少女，因为对于幽夜净土的执著追求，导致觉醒了神之眼，唤醒了奥兹——幽夜净土的使者，一只吐槽役的乌鸦。自称为幽夜净土的皇女，因此这个绰号也就留了下来。

而辛焱，在整体剧情中的出现次数过少，且造型为黑皮，摇滚，冲天双马尾，所有的元素都不算大众的喜好因素，给玩家留下的印象则更…</span>

The problem with energy costs is that most people don&#x27;t think about them. They just look at their overall bill without considering how the energy was used. By monitoring and measuring energy use through sensors in very specific locations, energy waste can be made transparent and reduced.
That&#x27;s the premise of the book Reinventing Fire: Bold Business Solutions for the New Energy Era, which offers methods to eliminate the use of fossil fuels by 2050 through energy waste reduction. It&#x27;s also the premise of a story I began in an earlier article about two retired utilities salespeople-turned-consultants who started an open organization community to reduce energy waste in their region…</span>

Having a dark theme for your website is a common feature these days. There are various ways to add a dark theme to your website, and in this article, I demonstrate a beginner-friendly way of programming a dark theme for the web. Feel free to explore, make mistakes, and, more importantly, learn by manipulating the code in your own way.

𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗮 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁:
I often create images for sharing on Twitter and Instagram using Tweetlet. Using Tweetlet I can make images from text but making code snippet images has been bit difficult using markdown text. 

So I wanted to have a full fledged tool to create code snippet images right in the Tweetlet. That&#x27;s where the idea about CodeLet occurred to me.

𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘂𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀:
1. Toggle the top bar of code snippet
2. Feature to select different theme
3. Different font sizes

Hope this CodeLet application will be helpful to all those who want to create attention grabbing beautiful code snippet images just in no time. 💫

Please share your views/feedback about this product.

Thank you for stopping by 🙏

                              <span>Hi，朋友。这个周终于读完了《走出唯一真理观》，翻看笔记时看到了下面这句话，刚好对这个事情也有一些亲身体会，借此契机聊聊这个话题。

所谓的贯通不是用同一套道理概括一切，越是这样笼统地概括，越是无法接近本质，贯通是不同道理之间一种对话的契机。

从抽象到具体
        去年年底我需要招个实习生帮忙完成一些工作，看到HR推来的几份实习生简历还有点惊讶，现在实习生都这么卷吗？一页纸简历满满当当的实习经历，其中不乏优秀的大公司，实习做的事情看起来也很厉害，比如说“用户生命周期”、“销售转化率”、“曝光量”等等，我们开会经常用的词有一大半就出现了实习生的简历上，让人诚惶诚恐。
        面试深入交流就会发现同学对运营、用户的理解远不及简历上绚丽的词汇。回答问题时，套用模板方法论的痕迹很明显。比如，如果让你来策划一个活动，你会怎么策划？很多同学会告诉你网上的那些步骤，当你更深入一层追问其中细节时，“你的转化率是哪一个环节到哪一个环节的转化率？数据提升具体是做了什么动作？你为什么要做这个动作？透过这个动作你的思考是什么？”，同学的水平如何就体现出来了。当然，这样深入的细节追问不仅是实习生，哪怕正职员工的面试也会被细细询问。
        越是细节的追问，越容易发现不同的人对于一件事的理解、思考的深度差异。真正做过、不断思考的人会给你讲得特别清楚，逻辑也会很完善。
        如果说实习生对专业词汇和术语的大肆应用是这个行业的冰山一角，那么对“方法论”和“底层逻辑”的迷恋大概是互联网行业通病。聪明人太多，相较枯燥的执行更愿意去快速了解各种各样的方法论和底层逻辑，倡导快速达成目标和高效率。从这个角度来方法论也是一个ROI高、快速达成目标的方法。只要知道底层的方法论，就可以看透一切，所向披靡。

                              <span>这个周末又被封在家里了，去不了咖啡厅工作，客厅里唯一的办公位被麦嫂占领，两个孩子也很无聊，跑老跑去不得消停。于是，我也选择躺平了，一天睡两觉，醒了就刷视频、看电影。但偶尔又会想起公司的事；疫情各地物流受阻，电商收入又要受到影响；定好的品牌视频拍摄，可能又要因为疫情而延期；想着想着，心中又开始焦虑了，就这样在躺平、焦虑，焦虑、躺平之间反反复复，心情更差了。
其实回头想想，在整个创业过程中，这点焦虑都属于家常便饭，但大部分人可能会困在焦虑之中，难以自拔。今天就聊聊我曾经最焦虑的几个阶段，也许能给大家一点参考吧。
2015 年，为了公司业务转型，我开始尝试寻找投资人。性格内向且缺乏经验的我，除了要面对外部的各种质疑，还有应对内部的复杂关系，老股东该如何安顿？合伙人该怎样分配？每一次谈话，每一次邮件发出之后，都会让我无比焦虑。那段时间，我经常无意识的在街上暴走，或者去海边呐喊宣泄，情绪一直处于过山车状态，非常抑郁。直到融资搞定之后，我安排的第一件事是去医院做了全面体检，特别担心身体会出现大问题。
焦虑归焦虑，真正解决问题的方法，还是要不停的尝试，通过理性沟通处理各方的诉求，该留的留，该走的走。突破自己原有的圈层，放开性格包袱，去寻找更多的可能性。所以，最终的融资不是来自投资公司，而是来自客户、同行和用户。
2017 年，迎来了又一次创业考验，好不容易融到的一点钱，很快就花完了，马上就要进入发不出工资的窘境。现在想想其实也怪自己，拿到投资的一年时间里，过度的沉醉于资本市场逻辑当中，把大部分精力放在 BP 故事里，忽略了公司管理和业务聚焦，且一度自我感觉良好。
此刻摆在眼前只有两条路：要么想尽一切办法支撑下去，要么选择清算并关闭公司。但这两条路都很难。不能再指望外人援助，靠自己就只能抵押房子，一旦失败，全家归零。想想已经积累数年的内容、用户、品牌，如果选择结束，也很难再有这样的机会了。何况我们确实做着正确且有价值的事情，只是我们还没有掌握更好的商业模式。
一边筹措资金，一边送走部分团队，一边重新走出去约见客户。让客户了解我们的内在价值，哪怕是很小的客户，哪怕没有预算也无所谓，做好服务，以真诚换真诚。因为有前面的积累，加上团队的努力，半年之后，公司就能自己运转了。
2020 年，公司业务已经稳定了，且略有盈余，我也终于还完了大部分贷款，总算可以轻装上阵。没想到春节刚过，新冠疫情全面爆发，全体成员隔离在家。刚刚起步的电商业务，直接就休克，客户拜访计划也全都暂停。说内心不慌是不可能的，焦虑情绪也开始了，但天灾面前，似乎也没什么办法。
既然公司业务上没办法，就做点力所能及的事吧。无意间在工作群里发现了疫况小程序，可以通过地图定位周边疫情风险，我仔细研究发现是之前认识的开发者做的，聊天一问才知道，他也正在发愁中，数据录入、服务器压力，马上就撑不住了。于是我立刻动员了产品开发团队，参与到这个小程序的支持中，重构界面、扩容服务器、招募数据志愿者、紧急制作疫情科普防护内容，每天熬十几个小时，连续一周，竟然把这个小服务提供给三千万人。
这段时间的无偿投入，虽然没有多少商业收益，却让更多人知道了少数派的存在，展现了团队的价值观，也间接验证了优质内容的多重价值。
经过这些事情之后，我个人的抗焦虑能力算是大幅提升，并且也建立了应对原则。人非圣贤，孰能无虑，适当的放低预期，知足常乐。另一方面，既然焦虑不可避免，就不要轻易放弃思考和行动。要知道宏观环境下，很多问题都是阶段性和周期性的，它总会过去或者从头再来，但你的人生经历只有一次，你的行动将决定自己未来的走向。不管有多焦虑，都应该先选择承担起当下的责任，因为转机就发生在这个过程之中。
换个角度来看，这世界上还有很多人，正在面对着各种生存、病痛、离别、各种不可逆转的人生变故，他们可能都还没有焦虑的机会，相对来说，我们依然属于幸运的多数派了。</span>

不知不觉又到 8 月底了，回顾电子手帐，一川今年截至8月看完了 24 本书，这其中只有两本小说，其中之一是萨莉 · 鲁尼的新作《美丽的世界，你在哪里》。今天就想和大家聊一聊这位 90 后爱尔兰当红作家的三部作品——《聊天记录》（2017 年）、《正常人》（2018 年）和《美丽的世界，你在哪里》（2021 年）。
一川今年的阅读记录
#顺遂的作家之路
迄今为止，鲁尼的作家之路可谓无比顺遂。处女作《聊天记录》斩获七家出版社的青睐、在 12 个国家出版，彼时她还在攻读美国文学硕士学位。第二本《正常人》全球销量超 300 万册、获奖无数，并于 2020 年被 BBC 和 Hulu 改编成热门剧集。第三本《美丽的世界，你在哪里》一经发售，便占据《纽约时报》小说排行榜第一名，还被 “美国版豆瓣”Goodreads 评为 2021 年年度最佳小说。《纽约时报》更是称鲁尼为 “千禧一代的第一位伟大作家”，虽然有些捧杀，但毫无疑问她是当今欧美文坛最闪耀的新星。
萨莉 · 鲁尼的三部作品
一川最初知道鲁尼就是因为她实在太红了，于是在北京前门逛 Page One 书店时便买了她的处女作《聊天记录》，但我阅读的第一本鲁尼作品是《正常人》。
《正常人》是鲁尼作品中主人公中初始年纪最为年轻的，两位爱尔兰西部的小镇青年——玛丽安和康奈尔是中学同学，虽然两人的家庭环境、社会阶层截然不同，但是原生家庭的伤痛让他们走到了一起，开启了一段友谊与爱欲交织的关系。两人在成长的不同时期，都曾经是世俗眼中的 “非正常人”、边缘人，虽然中途各自与他人交往，却又有某种不可抗拒的磁力让两人彼此拉近，双方在纠缠中既有伤害也有爱与救赎，最终慢慢学会了以对方为镜子，找到自己在生活中的位置。
老实说，我没有那么喜欢大火的《正常人》，大概由于青春期距离我太遥远了，书中某些残酷青春的情节于我而言缺乏共鸣，我可以理解两…</span>

There are (at least) two ways to look at the move to more green power generation: the supply side and the demand side. The supply side emphasizes a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy and carbon-free energy. The demand side, however, looks at how to reduce energy use, preferably without hurting the current standard of living.
This article will focus on making changes from the demand side.
The business opportunities in reducing energy demand
Imagine two salespeople who sell electricity for a utility company. They decide they don&#x27;t want to promote or sell electricity use anymore because of its negative environmental and climate change impact. They retire and then decide they…</span>

Updates to a system used to be relatively straightforward. When a developer needed to revise something that they&#x27;d already distributed to the public, an updater would be released for people to run. Users would run the updater, allowing old files to be replaced by new files and new files to be added. Even with these &quot;relatively straightforward&quot; updates, though, there was a catch. What happens when a user&#x27;s installation is in an unexpected state? What happens when an upgrade is interrupted? These questions are just as relevant now when all kinds of devices are online, and sometimes in need of important security updates. Many updates today are delivered wirelessly, over-the-air (…</span>

如今因为网课、居家办公已经深入生活，打印机除了是企业办公的必备品，也成为了不少家庭书房的一部分。打印机耗材一般是指墨盒、墨粉、墨水、晒鼓等，但最核心的必备品则是复印纸，它是打印载体，对于我们一般家庭使用，都是A4尺寸的复印纸。
复印纸国家标准的技术指标

我们如今在使用的A4打印纸，执行的是GB/T 24988-2020 《复印纸》，是2021年正式施行的新国标，起草标准的牵头单位为A股上市公司太阳纸业，代表产品为金太阳。消费者比较熟悉的亚太森博品牌也是新国标的起草单位之一。
复印纸根据参数水平不同分为优等品和合格品，优等品有更为出色的参数表现。在尺寸方面，我们最为熟悉的A4纸的标准尺寸为210*297mm。

技术指标方面，国标规定了定量、厚度、挺度、平滑度、不透明度、D65亮度、可勃值、尘埃度、交货水分等指标的检测。
定量指标也称为克重，指的是单位面积的质量，我们常说的70g、80g纸，其实单位是g/㎡，对打印纸的质感起决定性作用，对于市面上的大部分产品而言，70g纸适合单面打印，80g纸适合双面打印，90g纸可用于照片打印。
高定量纸张一般伴随高厚度，但这也和印刷工艺有关，优等品的厚度要求更高。
挺度指纸张的抗弯曲呢你，高挺度的纸张在打印机中更稳定，更不容易卡纸。
平滑度则是对纸张表面凹凸特性的测试，变向影响着纸张的最终印刷效果。
不透明度则是单张反射因数和内反射因数的比值，是纸张不透光能力的体现，高不透明度的纸张在双面打印、书写时更不容易受到背面的影响。
D65亮度指的是纸张在D65（R457)光源下的内反射因数，体现的是纸张的白度，越接近100%，纸张的白度越高。
可勃值是反映纸张的吸水能力，吸水少的打印纸在遇到水泼溅时，受到的影响就越小。

                              <span>7 月 29 日，Beyoncé 发布了时隔六年的录音室专辑 Renaissance。Beyoncé 在这张专辑以电子舞曲为底色，探讨了关于性别、种族、接纳与和解的议题。自发布起，这张专辑也获得了乐评与听众的广泛好评，除了到现在还没有发正经 MV 这件事1。
除去对社会议题与个人议题的人文关怀，这张专辑一个极大的特点就是「听感流畅」，在保持专辑主题内涵一致的前提下，歌曲与歌曲之间衔接自然，节奏的变化与旋律的流动没有带来割裂。如果你在 Apple Music 或其他支持「无缝播放」的平台按顺序播放整张专辑，会发现在大部分时间，你甚至无法听出两首歌之间的区隔，上一首歌最末的点题同时成为下一首歌的引子。而这正是我们今天的主题：无缝播放、segue 与概念专辑。
 
在数字音乐之前的年代，无缝播放（gapless playback）根本算不上一个值得单独拿出来的概念。当一张黑胶唱片或磁带被灌录好，送到消费者手上时，往往也是像灌录的过程一样，从头开始一直播放到底的。专辑的封底或是歌词本可能会标注不同歌曲时长或所在的时间点，但整个播放的过程是连贯的。
这样的播放习惯与介质特性给了一些擅长以概念构建专辑的艺术家机会。其中最典型的就是 Pink Floyd 乐队的「摇滚歌剧」专辑《The Wall》，与围绕时间、死亡和精神疾病的《The Dark Side of the Moon》。这支乐队非常明显的特征，就是专辑中常常毫无断点或停顿。其中，后者甚至在灌录之前，先行在剧场不间断地演出完四十余分钟的全长，如同一出无法停止的舞台剧；唱片则为未能到达剧场的听众带去同样的连贯体验，随着音乐进行感受唱片中讲述的孤独、恐惧与对现实的嘲讽。这种处理方式就被称作「segue」，直译作「无间断地从一段（音乐或场景）自然转向另一段」，在模拟音乐时代，甚至绝大多数的 CD 中，这是一件非常自然的事，因为音乐就是…</span>

Chris Hermansen
Sat, 09/03/2022 - 03:00

            
Recently I wrote a series on using Groovy scripts to clean up the tags in my music files. I developed a framework that recognized the structure of my music directory and used it to iterate over the content files. In the final article of that series, I separated this framework into a utility class that my scripts could use to process the content files.
This separate framework reminded me a lot of the way awk works. For those of you unfamiliar with awk, you might benefit from Opensource.com&#x27;s eBook, A practical guide to learning awk.
I have used awk extensively since 1984, when our little company bought its first &quot;real&quot; computer, which ran System V Unix. For me, awk was a revelation: It had associative …</span>

                              <span>有效的笔记并不只是简单地记录所听所见。
普通的笔记记录可以帮助巩固加深记忆和信息的过程，除了用自己的话尽可能准确地总结核心概念之外，还有更多思路方法可以进一步优化笔记。
大多数好学生的共同点是：他们使用特定的记笔记方法。在课前充分准备，在课堂中保持专注、积极参与，在课后高效复习关键概念。备考时也可以少走很多弯路。
本文中，我们整理了五种最适合大学生的记笔记方法，以及它们的适用场景和优缺点：

大纲法
康奈尔笔记法
笔记法
笔记法
笔记法

 
1. 大纲法 (The Outline Method)
大纲法可能是我们最熟悉的一种笔记法：结合项目符号（通常是小黑圆点）来表示不同的主题及其子主题，以大纲的形式构建笔记。开始在页面的最左侧编写主要主题，并使用缩进在下面的项目符号中添加相关的子主题。
大纲法可以在短时间内将大段信息的结构组织分明，也方便日后回顾时进一步审阅和编辑。
小红书博主 @百年摸鱼老字号
 
适用场景：课程/讲座/会议设置有比较清晰的结构和逻辑。
优点

以逻辑的方式突出讲座的重点
易于使用让学生集中注意力
减少审阅和编辑时间
为笔记提供适当和干净的结构

缺点

不适用于化学或数学等需要结合公式图表的科目
结构设定较为零散、不遵循特定逻辑的课程/讲座

 
2. 康奈尔笔记法 (The Cornell Method)

我们在之前的一篇文章中介绍过康奈尔笔记法。它与其他方法的区别主要在于页面布局：将页面分为三或四个部分，从顶部的一排标题和日期（可选）开始，底部一排，中间两列。 左列占页面30%的宽度，右列占70%。
 
右列记录所有实时课堂/会议笔记，左侧较窄的一列则用来补充记录关于笔记的评论、疑问或提示。在课堂/会议结束后，再花一点时间在底部栏补充总结主要思想，进一步加深记忆、消化知识点。

While skimming through SQL to prepare for interviews, I often come across this question: Find the employee with the highest or (second-highest) salary by joining a table containing employee information with another that contains department information. This raises a further question: What about finding the employee who earns the nth-highest salary department-wide?

                              <span>刚接触效率软件的朋友，经常会被两类软件弄混淆：
一类是清单/待办/Todo类软件，比如知名的滴答清单、极简待办、Reminder（苹果系统自带的提醒事项）、Microsoft to do、Things3、Sorted3、Todoist等等。
一类是日历类软件，比如苹果手机、华为手机系统自带的日历app，还有一些第三方的日历软件，比如Fantastical、Busycal、Google日历、Calendars等等。
这两类都能可以记录待办事项，进行时间上的规划，比如它们都能实现像「周三出差」、「5月3日购物」这样的日程提醒，但是二者又有很多不同之处，比如界面上的差异、使用方法上的差异等等。如果用更专业的术语来形容，这两类软件的目标也有显著的差别，前者主要进行任务（Tasks）管理，后者主要进行日程或时间（Time）管理，侧重点是不一样的。
这篇文章会从新手角度，聊一聊如何开启一段效率之旅。文章讲的内容比较浅显，一部分来自我这两年的探索，另一部分来自少数派友的分享。推荐大家读一读 @闲者时间_王掌柜君的文章（注意搜索之后选择「不限时间」，否则很容易错过早先的好文章），这篇文章也受到王掌柜 《术与道-聊聊我的时间管理》 这篇文章的启发，推荐大家阅读。
概念梳理
待办清单：侧重任务管理
第一类待办软件，顾名思义，就是以处理等待办理的事情，核心功能落在要做的「事件」上。
这类软件最简单的使用方法，就是在Inbox（收件箱）里输入一件待办事项。比如你想约几个老友抽空聚餐，只要在收件箱里记下这几个字，无需更多设置，等到你打开软件，看到这句话，就会起到提醒的作用。
如果你想要把这件事情规划得更详细，也可以为它设置各种属性，比如确定时间（约好在下周三晚8点），也可以预设提醒（前一天21:00提醒你，以提前安排出行），还可以设置标签（放到 #生活 这个标签下）、优先级（高，毕竟老朋友难得聚一次…</span>

我不希望你在没有判断的情况下全盘接受这篇文章的概念，所以请你在阅读的时候保持警觉。
文章里会涉及大量概念，由于和平时的使用方式有很大区别又想要便于理解，我用「」做了区分，如果你不习惯，请谅解。
另，最近住的地方开始降温了，我心情很好，希望你也有个好心情。

概念的第一个特征，非均质性
我想和你聊聊「概念」，准确地说，聊聊「概念」的两个特性。
第一个是非均质性。鉴于这个词我平时不常用，我觉得你应该也不太熟悉它。那你可以这么理解——你无法用「是」来说明一个概念。或者更直白一些，你无法对一个概念下一个准确的定义。
有些例子可以帮你理解这句话。你现在在脑子里随便选一个词，然后挑几本不同的字典查一下，或者网上找字典也可以。我作个假设，你大概会发现每本字典的解释都有一些差异，如果是纸质的字典，甚至同一字典不同的版本对同一个词的解释也有可能不一样。
所以你觉得发生了什么事？明明是同一个词，为什么不同的字典会有不同的解释？
或者我们可以举个更生活化的例子，包子。我不了解你的口味，但我猜你应该知道包子。于是，包子是什么？
就我个人而言，这大概是早餐偶尔会吃的，在早餐店一般都有的，从蒸笼里拿出来的，圆圆白白的，松松软软的，里面有馅的那个东西。
但是，你可能会有不同的意见。

包子必须在早餐店里才有吗？自己在家做过包子的人肯定也不少吧？
包子必须早餐吃吗？中午或者晚上甚至当零食解馋吃包子的人应该也有吧？
包子必须是圆的吗？做得稍微长一点，稍微三角形一点也有吧？
包子必须是白色的吗？黑麦包子应该也能找得到吧？

所以，到最后你可能会不认同我的想法。那么，包子是什么？我找到了度娘给的包子的定义。

包子，指用发面皮包馅蒸成的食品。

这当然比我给出的答案要准确了不少，但我觉得还有「一点点」不准确。

比如，你应该吃过一种生煎的包子吧？烤包子可能少一点，但也有，我还听说过油炸包子，虽然…</span>

                              <span>一直身处「音乐学院」这所「深宅大院」的我，常常面对一众亲朋：「你既为作曲专业，是否能如周杰伦那般给写曲一首，以引亢高歌？」的类似疑问感到十分无奈，也为当代古典音乐创作似乎已然成为妥妥的「少数派」，更几近沦为「音乐游乐园」中的「弃儿」而倍感受挫。
为了自己投身至今且热爱的「专业」，也为了分享更多隶属20世纪这一时期与所谓「Contemporary Classical」风格的音乐，遂尝试奋笔直书，一吐为快！
然，申请作者资格已半年有余，面对腹稿万千，竟不知该从何下手？直至今日读罢青年钢琴家张昊辰所写的 《演奏之外》 一书，对其中个别关键词若有所思，便「借题发挥」一二，间隙穿插作品若干，以供交流。
音乐与语言：音乐需要被听「懂」吗？
哲学语言自索绪尔始即讲求「能指」和「所指」的对应性，这是一种被彻底主体化的主客观映射。语言层面的二元性：能指和所指、深层和表层、语言和言说等关系在被转置到音乐中时相当难以定义且不易辨识。
语言可作为一种言谈交流工具，但也可以是文学，散文或诗歌。而音乐似乎一直都是「文学」的，它的演绎不会落入忠实于意思还是忠实于字词的困境。从规则出发，言说的语言和音乐的语言几乎完全同构，但就实际而言，二者又有相当的差距。当复调1产生时，人不需要对语义所指进行概念的解读，音乐，或称声音的「词汇」表达，一直就是其本身。而在言语中，语义的落实则确需占用人类大脑的大量带宽，一个词说出来或者不说出来，都同时包含且排除了许多其他的事物，我们或许不得不注重其中一条线索而放弃其他的线索，从这个角度看，语言似乎是单线的。
但语言的单线或许是一种无奈妥协？究其根本原因，也许是主体概念化的过程中，日常言语比音乐这般非概念化的输入对人脑运存的要求要高太多。而想要用类似语言之「所指」的层面去描述有意义的音乐是否也只能是一厢情愿的思考？
