                              <span>Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Lucene library. 




Shay Banon created the precursor to Elasticsearch, called Compass, in 2004.
Elasticsearch can be used to search any kind of document. 
&quot;Elasticsearch is distributed, which means that indices can be divided into shards and each shard can have zero or more replicas. 
Each node hosts one or more shards and acts as a coordinator to delegate operations to the correct shard(s). 
Related data is often stored in the same index, which consists of one or more primary shards, and zero or more replica shards. Once an index has been created, the number of primary shards cannot be changed.

                              <span>In this article I will explain to you how you can send an email with GraphQL or Hasura. The solution Hasura suggest, that is based upon Stored Procedures or Database Functions is (obviously) sub-optimal, since it implies adding business logic into your database. I’m not even sure about how to comment on this, so I’ll avoid sharing my opinion about this “solution” to stay polite. However, by creating an HTTP API gateway, that “intercepts” our invocation to your GraphQL endpoint, we can actually easily send emails, without changing anything in our frontend code, besides the URL we’re invoking.
This is easy because of that Hyperlambda has great support for creating such API gateways. So let’s look at a video where we create such an endpoint in some roughly 10 minutes.

You’re in the right place! In this post, we’ll cover the main challenges you can encounter while trying to do that. But first, let’s start with introducing both Puppeteer and AWS Lambda.
What is Puppeteer?
Simply put, Puppeteer is a software for controlling a (headless) browser. It’s a piece of open-source software developed and supported by Google’s developer tools team. It allows you to simulate user interaction with a browser through a simple API. This is very helpful for doing things like automated tests or web scraping.

                              <span>The first step to finding a good web developer is to understand what you need from the developer. You can start by looking at websites you like and note what you like about them and what you think could be improved. Good websites will often include the contact information of the web developer so you can contact them for more information. 
For example, are you looking for a simple website or a site that has advanced features? A medium-sized web project might include creating an online marketplace or integrating a payment portal. A large-scale project may require integrations with cloud stores or other complex features.

                              <span>Workflows are usually seen as a way to orchestrate systems. But that is just one of the uses cases. Workflows can be really good at expressing business logic to increase visibility into the logic implemented.
But then the question is how to define workflows?
In many cases, workflows are represented as models e.g. flow charts. That requires modelling tools as well which is not always what developers want to do. 
So to help developers enter the world of workflows, Automatiko (an open source toolkit to build services and functions based on workflows) introduced recently a Workflow Java DSL. 
This domain specific language (DSL) comes with a handy fluent like API to define workflows. It is very well integrated with any IDE to provide easy entry point for any developer.

                              <span>I have a confession: I am not that excited about all these new CSS features. Let me tell you why.
The year 2022 has been pretty wild for CSS. There has been a significant number of new features that have rolled out, like:
container queries
parent selector
accent color, and
cascade layers.
These are just the big ones, the game changers. The problem is they are not game changers for everyone. Or maybe for just me.
Let’s use the :has pseudo-class. It is a long-wanted CSS parent selector that might radically change how we write CSS.
While all major browsers are pushing new versions that support these new features, some users still don’t use the latest version of their browsers. That certainly brings down the excitement.

                              <span>After our very first introduction with Bun and running a ]React application with it, let&#x27;s look at how to run a NextJS application with Bun.
At the point of writing, there are still quite a few features on the roadmap, so we are a bit limited in what we can use.
To get started, run the following command to generate the project.
bun create next bun-next

Where bun-next is the project folder name, you will be creating with this command.
This will scaffold your basic Next application, and you can go ahead and create components and pages as you normally would.
However, there are some caveats I ran into.
API routes don&#x27;t work yet
I had an issue with fetch in SSR *(this should be upcoming soon)
And I&#x27;ve read the Tailwind plugin is not fully supported
However, it&#x27;s an excellent way to try out Bun and see how fast it is.
I added a new page to the project called about.js.
import Head from &#x27;next/head&#x27;;
import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import styles from &#x27;../styles/Home.module.css&#x27;;
import nextPackage from &#x27;next/package.json&#x27;;

export default function About({}) {
  return (
    
Next.js
        
        
About
Back to the homepage
      
    
Read more on the about page

As you can see, I&#x27;m using the HTML link instead of the Next one; this seems unsupported in Bun. But I will come back to this.
As for now, we can run Next.js on a Bun runtime.

                              <span>I often get asked...
&quot;Will you mentor me?&quot; &#x3D;&gt; And the answer is: No !
However... the &quot;why not&quot; might surprise you.
It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t want to help... It&#x27;s that when you ask this question, you&#x27;re asking more effort from me than you&#x27;re giving yourself.
When someone reaches out to me like this...
I always ask them the same four questions:
What role are you targeting?
Why do you think you specifically can get that role?
What FIVE skills are you focussing on?
What skills are you NOT focussing on?
Answer these four questions and you&#x27;ll get immense clarity on your route into the cloud industry. No mentoring required.
I&#x27;m not &quot;anti mentoring&quot;.
I&#x27;m just pro: self-sufficiency, empowering you with tools to unblock yourself—and radical and honest feedback and advice!
If you can find a mentor—amazing!
If not, you can follow my suggestions (for free).
I will link a YouTube video that walks you through these four questions below 👇 In the YouTube video there is also a multi-page PDF that walks you through these exact questions !</span>

                              <span>Victor Shepelev (Zverok) has just landed an extremely useful feature in Ruby, Data.define. You can find the merge here:
https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/6353
...and the Ruby discussion here:
https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16122
So what is it and what does it do? Well that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to take a look into.
Succinctly put Data.define creates an immutable Struct type which can be initialized with either positional or keyword arguments:
Point &#x3D; Data.define(:x, :y)
origin &#x3D; Point.new(0, 0)
north_of_origin &#x3D; Point.new(x: 0, y: 10)

...and because the API supports pattern matching you can very much do things like this still:
case origin
in Point[x: 0 &#x3D;&gt; x, y] # rightward assignment, pattern matching
  Point.new(x:, y: y + 5) # shorthand hash syntax
else
  origin
end

矩阵乘法问题是一种关键的计算类型，它是许多不同应用的核心，从屏幕上显示图像到模拟复杂的物理学。加快这种计算可能会对成千上万的日常计算机任务产生重大影响。但想优化矩阵相乘的步骤很难。DeepMind 将该问题变成一种三维棋盘游戏 TensorGame。训练了一个新版本的 AlphaZero，称为 AlphaTensor，来玩这个游戏，以尽可能少的动作赢得游戏。AlphaTensor 发现了一种将两个四乘四的矩阵相乘的方法，只需要 47 步，基本的高中数学方法需要 64 步，而之前的最佳方法是德国数学家在 1969 年发明的 49 步的方法。此外，“AlphaTensor 在超过 70 种不同大小的矩阵中击败了现有的最佳算法。”

老王点评：没想到 AI 居然可以在数学上找到更好的算法，果然人力有时而穷。此外，对矩阵相乘的改进，应该会从底层提升很多你想不到的地方的性能。




英特尔推动 GPU 通用编程库 SYCL 的发展

如今在加速计算和 GPU 领域，CUDA 只能在英伟达的 GPU 上运行，AMD 的 CUDA 可以在 AMD 的 GPU 上运行，但你不能用 CUDA 为英特尔的 GPU 编程。因此，英特尔推动开源 SYCL 规范的发展，该规范旨在为 GPU 和加速计算做几十年前 Java 为应用开发所做的工作。SYCL 是一种用 C++ 语言进行数据并行编程的方法，它看起来很像 CUDA，可以在英特尔、AMD 和英伟达的 GPU 上运行，而无需改变你的代码。

老王点评：这就是一个英特尔的 CUDA，但是以开放的名义。




SELinux 继续废弃运行时禁用功能

SELinux 已经废弃了运行时禁用功能，即通过编辑配置文件或 sys 文件系统来即时禁用它。但相关的代码和功能尚未从内核中删除，Linux 6.1 仍然具有处理 SELinux 运行时禁用的废弃能力。在最新的 Linux 6.1 的合并请求中，SELinux 删除了对该能力的一个文档参考，向废弃该能力小小的迈了一步，其它的部分几乎没有什么大的变化。一种简单和非侵入性的正确禁用 SELINUX 的方法是，在启动 Linux 时可以将 selinux&#x3D;0 作为一个内核参数传递进去。

老王点评：抛开 SELinux 的 NSA 背景不谈，SELinux 其实安全但繁琐，所以运行时禁用 SELinux 往往成为了一种偷懒行为或安全缺陷。</span>

                              <span>Quarkus 令你可以使用类似 Java 的技术开发无服务器的工作负载。


对 无服务器 Java 的研究始于函数 —— 就是按需求运行的一小段代码。这一阶段并没有持续很长时间。虽然在 1.0 阶段，基于虚拟机架构的函数使这种范式变得很流行，但它仍然有局限性，例如执行时间、协议和糟糕的本地开发体验，都不太理想，如下图所示。

开发者随后意识到，可以把同样的无服务器特性应用于微服务和 Linux 容器，带来的好处也是一样的。由此进入 1.5 阶段，在这个阶段，一些无服务器容器完全抽象化了 Kubernetes，通过 Knative 或其它位于它之上的抽象层来提供无服务器的体验。

在 2.0 阶段，无服务器开始处理更复杂的编排和集成模式，并结合某些层级的状态管理。更重要的是，开发者关注的是能否在旧的系统中使用熟悉的 Java 应用程序运行时来组合运行无服务器和非无服务器的工作负载。



Java 开发者开始进行无服务器函数开发之前，第一步是要选择一种新的云原生 Java 框架，从而能够以快于传统单体应用程序的速度和较小的内存占用运行 Java 函数。这在各种基础设施环境中，包括物理服务器、虚拟机、多云或混合云环境中的容器，都是适用的。

开发者也有可能固执地选择 Spring 框架中的 Spring 云函数 来进行命令式和反应式函数的开发。Spring 也支持将 Java 函数部署到可安装的无服务器平台，比如 Kubeless、Apache OpenWhisk、Fission 和 Project Riff。然而，人们担心 Spring 的启动慢、响应时间长以及内存占用大的问题。在诸如 Kubernetes 这种可扩展的容器环境中运行 Java 函数，这些问题可能会更严重。

Quarkus 是一个新推出的开源云原生 Java 框架，它有助于解决这些问题。…</span>

又一个基于 Ubuntu 的 Linux 发行版？😕

不完全是！TUXEDO 计算机公司 是一家硬件制造商，以其专注于 Linux 的笔记本电脑和计算机而闻名。

TUXEDO OS 与 Ubuntu 之间存在着一些有趣的差异。

虽然他们已经在笔记本电脑/计算机上提供预装 TUXEDO OS 的选项，但是它并未对所有人开放。

终于，他们决定将其发行版的第一个版本作为 TUXEDO OS 1 开放，该版本现已可供下载。

这也意味着你可以在自己的非 TUXEDO 系统上试用它。

所以这个思路很像 System76 的 Pop!_OS，所以这并不算一件坏事 👌

搭配 KDE 的 TUXEDO OS 1



TUXEDO OS 1 是基于 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 的; 所以它应该可以直接在大多数设备上运行。

与 System76 的 Pop!_OS 不同，TUXEDO OS 搭载了 KDE Plasma 5.24.6。因此，它应当提供了一个 Windows 用户也较为熟悉的用户界面。

但是，TUXEDO OS 还包括一些额外的功能，例如 TUXEDO 控制中心，用于微调你的硬件（CPU/风扇等），以及 TUXEDO Tomte，一个用于解决驱动程序/缺少包问题的配置服务，但是它或许能，或许不能在其他硬件配置上工作。

说到这里，让我们看看 TUXEDO OS 及其提供的功能。

用户体验正如预期一样，与任何基于 KDE 的 Ubuntu 发行版相同。

                              <span>开源身份标准和策略协调软件巩固了对多云访问策略的管理。


根据多云身份协调公司 Strata Identity 的说法，Hexa 和 IDQL（身份查询语言Identity Query Language）开源项目使组织能够在多个云平台上的应用程序中采用一致的访问策略，已被云原生计算基金会（CNCF）接受为沙盒项目：https://www.cncf.io/projects/hexa/

“云身份Cloud Identity 是非常分散的，没有明确的路径来协调不同服务提供商平台的策略管理，” TechVision Research 首席咨询分析师兼首席执行官 Gary Rowe 说。“IDQL 代表了在为基于云的 IAM 治理提供基于标准的方法方面向前迈出的重要一步。”

Linux 基金会的 CNCF 是一个致力于监督开源云原生计划的非营利组织。Versa Networks、S&amp; Global、Cummins、Kroger、MEF 和 Strata Identity 都是 IDQL 和 Hexa 的作者和工作组参与者。有关如何帮助该项目的更多详细信息，请访问 https://hexaorchestration.org。

目前，每个云平台（如 AWS、谷歌云、微软 Azure 等）都使用一个独特的身份系统，采用独特的策略语言，彼此完全不兼容。而每个应用程序都需要进行硬编码才能与特定的识别系统一起运行。根据 2022 年多云身份状况调查，只有 25% 的受访者表示他们了解多云访问限制，这对企业来说是一个重大障碍。

基于该公司创始人共同编写 SSO 联盟 SAML 标准的经验，Strata Identity 领导了 Hexa 和 IDQL 项目。这个新项目的目标是引入一个精心设计的开源策略编排框架，以增加组织、客户和软件提供商从转向现代、开放和无密码的身份验证方法中获利的可能性。

在不改变识别系统或应用程序的情况下，IDQL 和 Hexa 允许任意数量的身份系统作为单个集成系统运行。这些开源计划共同提供了以下优势：

发现策略：


对重要的应用程序、数据和策略进行分析和清点

发现可用的应用程序以及它们的位置

识别策略、用户和角色


管理策略：


在策略发现期间，将本机命令式策略转换为声明性 IDQL 策略

在策略编排期间，将声明性 IDQL 策略转换为目标系统的本机命令式策略


策略编排：


使用基于云的架构，无需代理、代理或本地代码；

分发的规则由身份提供者（IdP）、云、IaaS 和网络系统执行

采用可扩展的开源范例，允许定制的连接器集成

Elon Musk will no longer be deposed by Twitter’s lawyers on Thursday morning, after both sides agreed to a delay as they worked to close the $44 billion purchase of the social media network, the Financial Times and Bloomberg report. Musk was scheduled to be deposed for two days in Tesla’s home of Austin, Texas starting at 9:30AM, ahead of the trial’s scheduled start on October 17th. His deposition was previously pushed back from its original September 28th date due to COVID-19 exposure concerns. 
Both sides are reportedly working to close the deal, after Musk informed Twitter this week of his intention to proceed with his original offer of $54.20 a share (though the New York Times reports that he had attempted to lower the price in...

Two days into the launch of Blizzard’s revamped and now free-to-play Overwatch 2 experience, a Wednesday night post on its support forum addressed problems players have had with connections, SMS Protect, and missing account items or account merge troubles. 
In terms of the connection issues and long queues for entry that are keeping many of us stuck at the loading screen (Login queues, server crashes, and stability problems), a critical login server has been patched to help it hold up under the load. Blizzard says it’s also slowly scaling up the nodes in its player databases to help them handle the onrush of players diving in.

Blizzard said: “In all cases, no player data has been wiped or lost.”

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol based on SSLv3 designed to encrypt and decrypt traffic between two sites. In other words, TLS ensures that you&#x27;re visiting the site you meant to visit and prevents anyone between you and the website from seeing the data being passed back and forth. This is achieved through the mutual exchange of digital certificates: a private one that exists on the web server, and a public one typically distributed with web browsers.
In production environments, all servers run securely, but server certificates may expire after some period. It is then the server&#x27;s responsibility to validate, regenerate, and reuse newly genera…</span>

@甜食：神藤毛巾内毛圈浴巾

入手渠道：淘宝
入手价格：370 元

最近因为搬家，许多生活用品需要重新购买，其中自然也包括各类卫浴洗漱用品这种又占空间、单价又便宜，导致搬走不如买新的的物件。在物色新浴巾的时候，我发现了神藤毛巾这个品牌。神藤毛巾是日本大阪的毛巾品牌，有别于传统的毛圈表面的毛巾，他们的产品以棉纱材质的毛巾见长。
传统毛巾的毛圈材质表面积更大，用来清洁自然是效率更高的，不过生活在南方的读者应该多少都会有潮湿天气下毛巾连日难以风干，甚至产生异味的经验，神藤的毛巾采用了多层纱布的织法，既保证了良好的吸水性，疏松的质地也让毛巾更加速干，同时比较平滑的表面也提供了更清爽的触感。
我最终购买的这款产品叫作 Inner Pile，算是神藤毛巾比较创新的一款产品（和很多刻板印象中的日本作坊式品牌一样，他们总共只有三款产品 —— 另外两款是多层棉纱毛巾「2.5-PLY GAUZE」和传统的毛圈毛巾「YUKINE」，具体用途只通过尺寸来区分），由外层的两层纱布夹着中间的一层毛圈构成。由于中间的毛圈层，这款毛巾的吸水性比纯纱布的毛巾更胜一筹，整体也更蓬松，摸起来甚至有点冬天棉衣的蓬松感，但又非常轻。外层的纱布又保证了清爽的触感，格外适合作为浴巾使用。
毛巾的近距离状态，可以看到多层疏松透光的结构毛巾的标签，我到手之后直接把标签拆了，没有拍到新品缝在毛巾上的样子
我这些年的一个经验是，从所谓改善生活质量的角度出发，买更多更好更贵的大件（如电子产品）带来的幸福感往往远不如买一些高品质的小件生活用品。…</span>

美国白宫提出围绕 AI 的自愿安全和透明规则

白宫周二提出了一项不具约束力的《人工智能权利法案》，称其将帮助父母、病人和工人避免因教育、医疗和就业领域越来越多地使用自动化而受到伤害。人工智能软件的开发者和使用者应该自愿遵守，以防止该技术不公平地对人们造成不利。但该法案对私营企业没有约束力，美国商会警告说，如果这些不具约束力的建议成为规则，可能会损害美国企业在全球舞台上的竞争能力。近些年屡屡出现算法失控的例子，如一些算法被发现具有歧视性，这是由于系统训练所依据的数据。

什么是《代码英雄》

代码英雄Command Line Heroes是世界领先的企业开源软件解决方案供应商红帽（Red Hat）精心制作的原创音频播客，讲述开发人员、程序员、黑客、极客和开源反叛者如何彻底改变技术前景的真实史诗。该音频博客邀请到了谷歌、NASA 等重量级企业的众多技术大牛共同讲述开源、操作系统、容器、DevOps、混合云等发展过程中的动人故事。




本文是《代码英雄》系列播客《代码英雄》第五季（2）：程序员写代码的地方 的 音频 脚本。




导语：家庭办公室、企业园区、联合办公空间、有趣的校园。程序员们希望在工作场所方面有所选择。将普通的工作空间从办公室转移到家里，揭示了在家里工作的好处，但也突出了它的权衡。

Saron Yitbarek 和 Clive Thompson 通过考虑工作场所继续他们对编码职业的讨论。Mary Allen Wilkes 分享了她作为第一个在家工作的开发者的经验。David Heinemeier Hansson 认为远程工作使他的同事有时间进行深入思考。Dave West 解释了为什么他认为面对面的工作仍然能产生最好的结果。Maude Mensah Simpson 权衡了家庭办公室的自由与失去面对面交流的机会。

WebAssembly (also referred to as Wasm) has gained popularity as a portable binary instruction format with an embeddable and isolated execution environment for client and server applications. Think of WebAssembly as a small, fast, efficient, and very secure stack-based virtual machine designed to execute portable bytecode that doesn&#x27;t care what CPU or operating system it runs on. WebAssembly was initially designed for web browsers to be a lightweight, fast, safe, and polyglot container for functions, but it&#x27;s no longer limited to the web.
On the web, WebAssembly uses the existing APIs provided by browsers. WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) was created to fill the void between WebAssembly and sys…</span>

                              <span>允许用户使用 sudo 运行命令，但不带命令行参数。


在之前的文章，我们学习了如何 通过 sudo 以 root 身份运行目录中的命令。在这篇指南中，我们将学习如何在 Linux 中 防止 sudo 运行的命令使用参数。即我们允许一个用户使用 sudo 运行特权级命令，但是 不带命令行参数。

背景介绍

你已经知道了，每个命令执行一个特定操作有不同的选项。让我们以 ls 命令为例。

ls 命令会罗列文件夹中的内容，对吗？没错。ls 命令附带了一些命令行选项和标志。例如，你可以用 ls 命令的 -a 标志罗列文件夹中的所有内容（包括隐藏文件）。

在这份简要指南中，我们将明白如何允许用户通过 sudo 运行 ls 命令，但是不能使用命令行选项或者标志。我讲清楚了吗？接下来让我来展示一下如何做到这点。

防止使用 sudo 参数

以 root 用户身份编辑 /etc/sudoers 文件：

[root@Almalinux8CT ~]# visudo


添加下面一行：

user1   ALL&#x3D;(root)      /usr/bin/ls &quot;&quot;




要注意这里 ls 之后的 双引号。双引号会屏蔽用户在给定命令之后输入的参数（比如 ls 命令）。在上面的命令中，user1 能够以 root 身份运行 ls 命令，但是不能使用 ls 命令的选项以及标志。你可以选择其他的指令进行尝试。保存该文件并关闭。

现在，以 user1 的身份登录系统，并尝试以管理员身份运行 ls 命令，不要添加任何选项：

[user1@Almalinux8CT ~]$ sudo -u root ls -a


或许你会遇到下面的报错：

Sorry, user user1 is not allowed to execute &#x27;/bin/ls -a&#x27; as root on Almalinux8CT.


不过你可以不添加参数来运行 ls 命令：

[user1@Almalinux8CT ~]$ sudo -u root ls




防止所有用户使用命令参数

上述例子像你展示了如何阻止用户以管理员身份运行带有参数的命令。你是否想要对所有用户应用该规则呢？很简单！只需要在 /etc/sudoers 文件中添加一行：

ALL   ALL&#x3D;(root)      /usr/bin/ls &quot;&quot;


现在，系统中的所有用户都可以运行不带参数的 ls 命令。

想要恢复默认设置，只需要删除最后的双引号，或者删除整行。

查看帮助手册，了解更多。

$ man sudoers


结论

在这份指南中，我们学习了如何允许用户以管理员身份运行命令，但是不能添加任何命令参数。这样可以限制用户误用一些命令行参数。

                              <span>这就是在包括 Ubuntu 在内的 Linux 系统中将语音转换为文本的方法。


Linux 系统中可用的语音识别软件不多，尤其是原生桌面应用。有一些可用的应用使用 IBM Watson 和其他 API 将语音转换为文本，但它们的用户交互不友好，需要一些复杂的用户交互，例如用相应的语言进行一些编程或脚本编写。

但是，没有多少用户知道 谷歌文档Google Docs 使用自己的 AI 技术提供了高级语音识别，它可以通过 Chrome 访问谷歌文档使用。

任何用户都可以使用此功能将语音转换为文本，而无需高级计算机知识。谷歌文档的这个功能最好的一点是你可以在任何 Ubuntu 衍生版或任何支持 Chrome 的 Linux 发行版中使用它。

让我们看看如何在 Ubuntu 中启用它。

如何将语音转换为文本

先决条件是你应该在系统中安装 Chrome 并拥有谷歌帐户。如果你没有安装 Chrome，你可以访问 此链接 并下载、安装 Chrome。

此外，如果你没有谷歌帐户，你可以使用 此链接 免费创建一个。

步骤 1

从 Chrome 打开 https://docs.google.com 并创建一个空白文档。



步骤 2

加载空白文档后，从菜单中单击“工具 &gt; 语音输入”。



步骤 3

在左侧，你可以看到一个麦克风图标。单击麦克风图标，Chrome 会首次要求允许通过浏览器访问麦克风。单击允许。





默认情况下，它使用你的系统语言作为语音的检测语言，同时将其转换为文本；但是，你可以根据可用的语言列表将其更改为所需的任何语言。到目前为止，谷歌文档支持和识别超过 60 多种语言，同时将它们转换为文本。

步骤 4

单击允许后，麦克风图标将变为橙色，现在它已准备好接受或识别你的声音。开始说任何你想说的话，瞧！你将看到你的演讲被转换为文本并写入文档。



完成了。你已通过谷歌 Chrome 和谷歌文档在 Ubuntu 中成功地将语音转换为文本。

所有 Linux 用户都可以免费使用这个很棒的功能。如果你知道其他可以在 Linux 中将语音转换为文本的应用，请在下方的评论区发表评论。另外，让我知道你是否觉得这篇文章有用。

故障排除

如果上述功能在你的浏览器中不起作用，请务必查看以下内容。


打开设置窗口（在 Ubuntu 或其他发行版的 GNOME 桌面中）。

转到“隐私 &gt; 麦克风”。

并确保它已启用。




总结

虽然，最近有一种基于云的解决方案可用，例如 Amazon Polly 等。但它们的价格很高。另外还需要一些有用的知识。

而谷歌 Chrome 的内置语音识别功能简单易用。虽然它有点慢，但它可以为普通用户完成工作。

也就是说，我希望本指南可以帮助你将语音转换为文本，如果你知道这样的免费应用，请在评论区告诉我。

Dojo 是特斯拉的定制超级计算机平台，是为人工智能机器学习而建立的，更具体地说，是利用其汽车的视频数据进行训练。Dojo 是特斯拉去年公布的，但当时还只有芯片，经过一年的努力，现在有了系统托盘和机柜。特斯拉声称它可以用一个 Dojo 贴片取代 6 个 GPU 盒子，且成本低于一块 GPU。每个托盘有 6 块这样的贴片，一个托盘相当于 3 到 4 个满载的超级计算机机架。几个柜子放在一起可以创建一个 “Dojo ExaPOD”，其主要规格为 1.1 EFLOP，1.3 TB SRAM，以及 13 TB 高带宽 DRAM。今年早些时候，特斯拉在测试基础设施时曾让当地电网的变电站跳闸。

AWS 云端提供 Ubuntu 虚拟桌面

AWS 为使用亚马逊工作空间分配虚拟桌面的客户增加了一个 Ubuntu 选项。使用的是 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 版本，价格从每月每桌面 23 美元开始（或每小时 19 美分），包括一个 CPU、2GB 内存和 80GB 的根卷和 10GB 用户卷。但是目前用户只能使用 Windows 或基于 Web 的工作空间客户端进行连接。AWS 计划很快启用 Linux 和 MacOS 客户端的连接。

Linux 内核 6.1 合并窗口开启

正如预期的，对 Rust 支持被合并到了 6.1 当中，提供了基本的基础设施和一些非常基本的集成，而未来的拉取请求将增加更多的子系统抽象。Linux 6.1 还有一个对 memcpy() 溢出提出警告的安全改进，可以捕获过去 3 年中所有此类问题。Linux 6.1 还将继续花费大量时间来清理 Linux 的随机数生成代码。

                              <span>安装 Java，使用 Maven 安装 JDBC，并安装数据库。然后，你就可以在 Java 代码中与数据库进行交互了。




当你编写一个应用时，需要数据存储是很常见的。有时你要存储你的应用需要的素材数据，其他时候你要存储用户数据，包括偏好和保存的数据。存储数据的一种方式是在数据库中，为了在你的代码和数据库之间进行通信，你需要为你的语言提供一个数据库绑定或连接器。对于 Java 来说，一个常见的数据库连接器是 JDBC（Java 数据库连接Java database connectivity）。

1、安装 Java

当然，要使用 Java 进行开发，你还必须安装 Java。对于 Linux、macOS 和 WSL 或 Cygwin，我推荐 SDKman。对于 Windows，你可以从 developers.redhat.com 下载 OpenJDK。

2、使用 Maven 安装 JDBC

JDBC 是一种 API，通过语句 import java.sql.* 导入到你的代码中，但要使其有用，你必须安装数据库驱动和数据库以与之交互。你使用的数据库驱动和要通信的数据库必须匹配：要与 MySQL 交互，你需要 MySQL 驱动，要与 SQLite3 交互，你必须具有 SQLite3 驱动等等。

在本文中，我使用 PostgreSQL，但所有主流数据库，包括 MariaDB 和 SQLite3，都有 JDBC 驱动程序。

你可以从 jdbc.postgresql.org 下载 JDBC for PostgreSQL。我使用 Maven 来管理 Java 依赖项，因此我将它包含在 pom.xml 中（调整 Maven Central 上的当前版本号）：


    org.postgresql
    postgresql
    42.5.0



3、安装数据库

你必须安装要通过 JDBC 连接的数据库。有几个非常好的开源数据库，但是我只能为这篇文章选择一个，所以我选择了 PostgreSQL。

要在 Linux 上安装 PostgreSQL，请使用你的软件仓库。在 Fedora、CentOS、Mageia 和类似设备上：

$ sudo dnf install postgresql postgresql-server


在 Debian、Linux Mint、Elementary 和类似平台上：

$ sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib


数据库连接

如果你不使用 PostgreSQL，同样的一般过程也适用：


安装 Java。

为你选择的数据库找到 JDBC 驱动，并将其包含在你的 pom.xml 文件中。

在你的开发系统上安装数据库（服务器和客户端）。


三个步骤，你就可以开始编写代码了。

让我来帮助你。我将分享一些好看的 KDE Plasma 主题，你可以从中选择。我还会在文末展示安装主题的步骤。

最佳的 KDE Plasma 主题

请注意，这不是主题的排行榜。也就是说，排在第三位的主题不一定比第七位或第八位更好。

1、Sweet

Sweet 是目前最受欢迎的 KDE 主题之一。这个仅提供了深色模式的主题，可以为你的系统带来华丽的外观。



它可以通过 KDE 系统设置安装。它还提供了配套的图标，叫做 “Candy Icons”，如果你通过 KDE 系统设置安装，这套图标将会被自动安装。


Sweet 主题


2、Materia KDE

Materia 是另一个被很多桌面用户喜欢的主题，拥有光洁和优雅的外观。它有三个版本：Materia、Materia Light 和 Materia Dark。



Materia Light 是一个纯白色的主题，Materia Dark 提供了一个完整的深色外观。而 Materia 则是黑色和白色的融合。

它也可以通过 KDE 系统设置安装。

                              <span>一阵秋雨过后，忽然就意识到气温的变化，于是给衣橱换季也不得不提上了日程。
从收拾夏日衣物并分批洗涤，到把冬衣填进衣柜、不再穿的衣服送去衣物回收，一共用了三四天的时间。其中大部分时间都用在洗涤和晾晒，专门用来收拾布局的只有不到一天的时间。
之前的每次换季都不可避免地会撞上搬家，所以正儿八经的衣橱换季还是第一次。以下就是我这次整理衣橱的心得，另有对消费和断舍离的反思，希望对你有所帮助。
第一步：辞旧
此处的「旧衣服」指的是夏季的衣物，还有一些不打算再穿的衣服。
夏季出汗多，为了防止汗渍沉积，因此需要在收纳前清洗干净。如果是年初的冬夏换季，需要注意的是不能烘干的毛衣等需要更长的时间手洗、晾干，可能需要提前预留更多时间。
第一步就是把所有冬天不准备再穿的衣服都拿出来，掏干净口袋后分门别类放进不同的洗衣袋里。我的分类依据主要是洗涤方式：只可机洗不能烘干的，以及可机洗可烘干，深浅分开，一共四筐。另外还有一个纸箱，专门用来放不准备再穿的衣物。
 
洗涤先从至少需要过夜晾干的娇贵衣服开始，然后是可烘干的那些。中间我留了足够的时间，以确保大部分的衣服都能在差不多的时间内足够干爽，可以安心放进储藏室而不用担心发霉。
接下来，就是把所有衣服，按照洗涤方式分类放入收纳箱。家里的教诲是「把娇贵的衣服放在最上层才不容易被压坏」，但以我对自己的了解，天气热起来的时候肯定直接从最上层拿衣服，所以在上层放好洗的普通衣物总没错；同理，冬装收纳的最上层也是轻薄的毛衣。
这个过程中，我没有把所有洗干净的衣服都放进收纳箱，而是专门留下了许多不打算再穿的衣服。关于我的「断舍离」，会在后面有一节详细讲述。
而收起来准备明年再穿的衣服，都和一小块檀香皂放进可密封的袋子里，明年拿出来再穿的时候，衣服上就自然染上好闻的香气了！除了檀香皂，还可以尝试樟木球、香挂，以及切成小段、放进纸袋里的线香，都是可以持续散发香气、且味道不会…</span>

前言
开始的时候我就决定了，未来哪天必定要写这样的一篇阶段性总结文章，只不过那时设想的时间点远在第十个视频之后，而这天的到来比我所预期的要早很多，因为很幸运地提前完成了一个年初定下的小目标，全网 5 万关注达成了。
也因为我的账号起源与少数派这个网站有莫大关系，所以选择将这篇长文首发于此，希望能帮到对运营 B 站有想法、以及对视频剪辑工具有需求的同学。

数字文具盒征文活动 中看到许多将 Obsidian 纳入日常学习工作流的好文章，想必使用过程中或多或少都与命令（command）打过交道。所谓命令，其实就是在 Obsidian 执行的各种操作：新建文档、星标文档、打开大纲面板等常规操作，以及所有与插件的交互、使用快捷键执行的操作……这些都是命令。
和许多文本编辑器一样，Obsidian 内建了一个命令面板（Command Palette），用于快速搜索并执行命令。默认的快捷键 ⌘+P 唤起方便是方便，只不过这个内建的命令面板还是略显简陋了：只能搜索，顶多在设置中将常用命令置顶，就没了。它没办法记忆最近使用的项目，每次都要重新查找；并且文本编辑、核心插件、社区插件的命令一股脑儿混在一起，很多 几乎永远用不到的命令，由于首字母的关系，排名却很靠前。
尽管 Obsidian 一直在更新，也已经增加了许多呼声颇高的内容（比如 窗口多开），但还是没有往命令面板上做文章。你可能会说，常用的命令，用用快捷键就好了呀。不过我的系统全局快捷键已经很多了，所以除了极为常用的诸如加粗（⌘+B）这种命令，我还是倾向用快捷键以外的方式去执行命令。
那么本文将介绍三款优秀的社区插件，让 Obsidian 的命令更为好用。

写在前面：

本文若涉及快捷键，那么 modifier key 将会使用 Mac 标准的 ⌘、⌥、⇧ 等，Windows 系统请相应替换。
随着 Obsidian 的更新，许多插件已不再适配或是迁移、合并至新的版本。本文推荐的插件都是写作时点（2022-09-20）能够使用的。

                              <span>前言
为了在上班前再抓紧时间享受一下旅行的快乐，我和女朋友一起去了一趟杭州和绍兴。十年前，我和父母曾经去过一次杭州和苏州，但那时正值盛夏，酷暑难耐，我的父亲出行时又是出了名的紧张和暴躁，导致少了不少游玩的乐趣，杭州在我心目中也并没有留下什么深刻的印象。在一位杭州「土著」同学的怂恿下，为了帮助杭州洗刷这个对她并不公平的心理评价，我决定再来一次杭州。
按照这位同学说，我们这一次来得正是时候，赶上了杭州为期两周的秋天，早来了太热，晚来了太冷。
她是没错的。九月底的杭州真的是——好舒服啊！
除了正午那几个小时，杭州的天气这几天一直稳定在很适宜的温度，在室内和室外几乎没有温差。哪怕是上午快十二点，大晴天走在大街上也只是有丝丝暖意，如果这时候有几阵微风从西湖吹来，送上岸边荷叶清新的香气和清凉，我就会情不自禁地把手臂张开，闭上眼睛，好好感受这让人舒服得跺脚的惬意。
因为我们这一次以休闲游为主，并没有安排很满的行程，这几天都是睡到自然醒，吃完饭中午才出门，所以行程上也安排得不是很有效率。作为一个旅行攻略太过勉强，但也确确实实享受到了放空身心的那种悠闲和惬意。
灵隐寺
食
很惭愧，这一次是摆烂的行程。因为不想时间太紧张，所以并没有专门搜一些当地人才会去的苍蝇馆子，吃的都是比较常见的连锁餐厅，外婆家、新白鹿、绿茶。我这个外地人尝不出地不地道，但坐着挺舒适，味道也挺好的。我特别喜欢西湖天地那家外婆家，旁边就是西湖，吃完饭去消消食也是一流的。
第一天晚上杭州的同学带我们去银泰附近吃了一家名为杭州酒家的餐厅。据说已经有一百年历史了。叫花鸡被一层壳包裹，需要客人颇具仪式感地亲自敲几下，而后师傅再帮忙敲开，鸡肉已经酥软无比，香味甚至渗进了骨头；熏鱼比我想象中的多汁，带着一种甜甜的味道；藕粉样子很好看，但感觉味道稍淡了些，响铃沾了不同的酱料味道很丰富。

Awk is a powerful scripting tool that makes it easy to process text. Awk scripts use a pattern-action syntax, where Awk performs an action for every line in a file that matches a pattern. This provides a flexible yet powerful scripting language to deal with text. For example, the one-line Awk script /error/ {print $1, $2, $3} will print the first three space-delimited fields for any line that contains the word error.
While we also have the GNU variant of Awk, called Gawk, the original Awk remains under development. Recently, Brian Kernighan started a project to add Unicode support to Awk. I met with Brian to ask about the origins of Awk and his recent development work on Awk.

一入坑就被深深抓住了，198讲，每讲1.5～2h，听之前觉得太多了这怎么可能听得完，听之后感觉时间过得飞快，书里的时间，视频里的时间，还有现实生活中的时间，三条时间线交织重叠，构筑成一个亦真亦幻的世界。
这篇文稿不是为了总结300多小时的视频内容，只是作为一个外行人，分享在窥探瑰丽文学世界时的一些发现，以及这段经历给我带来的改变，包括对红楼梦观感的变化，对学问的深入理解，以及对自身心智模型的重塑。
书中的道理--超越风花雪月，草木荣枯
听完198讲红楼梦，更新了我对红楼梦的认知。目前我对红楼梦的理解，从它是一部关于贵族爱情的小说，变成了它是一部关于人的小说。
金玉良缘与木石前盟，映射着青春期的少男少女对爱情的懵懂。在我还没有足够的耐心去咀嚼优美的文字和艺术的行为前，一连串的言辞已经给我大脑一种“我已知晓此书”的信号：忧郁柔弱的林妹妹和纯真无邪的富家贵公子，爱而不得和包办婚姻，隐忍的，圣洁的；凄清的，热闹的；荒凉的，繁盛的……，构成了红楼的初印象：首先，世界并不只围绕着我；其次，即便如此，我也会被人无条件地坚定地选择。这种印象也可以被概括为：才子佳人模式。
曾经关注发生在人身上的情感流转，视频将我的视角转移到人本身。描写人物关系和个体命运的小说有那么多，红楼梦的精妙之处，是超越了风花雪月，草木荣枯。
每一个人物专论，都很容易让人产生强烈两个阶段的情绪共鸣。第一阶段，太真实了，这不就是我嘛。他们身上有非常鲜明的人格特质，其行事逻辑也能在我们身上找到影子。于国于家无望的宝玉，虽柔弱不安也…</span>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

首先，非常开心少数派上婉莹和甜食大大的播客制作栏目《100 小时后请叫我播客主理人》终于上线了，两位都是我很尊敬的播客制作者，之前也和两位有过关于播客和其他领域（比如音乐收藏和泉州故事）的交流，相信这个栏目一定会给到各位对于播客有兴趣的朋友很多帮助。
关于如何制作播客的相关教程，互联网上已经不少了，我自己之前也和生产力维基的白宦成合作过一期简单教学版本《小白和大耳的播客入门指南》，私下里我也在深圳线下做过几次关于制作播客的心得分享。很多教程和指南往往会集中在技术，设备，内容策划和运营等等方面，是一种「法」或者「术」层面上的描述，对于大多数的个人播客制作者，尤其是以兴趣为出发点的制作者来说，往往看了一些指南以后，就「一时兴起」录制并上传了自己的第一期节目，然后经历了一段时间的「方兴未艾」后，在某个时间突然因为繁忙的工作打断了「周更」的节奏，于是「戛然而止」。我自己的节目《对讲鸡 RadioChicken》也经历过几次这样的过程，曾经我也对诸如断更和订阅数减少（即使现在小宇宙的订阅只有 300 多个，最近几十个还都是各种社交 app 认识的）感到失落甚至焦虑，但经历了一些列佛系的思考后，我发现制作播客对我自己的意义，完全不在于「向外展示性表达」，更多的喜悦和快乐，反而在于「向内探索性成长」。
所以今天我想就此分享一些关于「向内探索性成长」的心得，希望对于各位对于播客有兴趣，甚至已经开始制作播客的朋友有所启发。
降低期待
我给新人播客制作者的第一个建议，是做好「降低期待，甚至不要有期待」的心理建设。我相信可能会有部分朋友开始做播客的原因…</span>

                              <span>我的 AirPods Pro 2 还没发货，我的 AirPods Pro 1 已经吃灰很久。AirPods Pro 的耳塞我越来越戴不稳，再加上比较「白开水」的调音，以及削弱后的主动降噪效果，让我觉得虽然 AirPods Pro 综合体验不错，但总是少了点意思，对我这个 PC 玩家来说使用场景也有些窄。
在 PC 上玩游戏，我始终不喜欢用头戴耳机，太大一坨挂头上，戴久了累，耳朵闷，还压头发。习惯各种无线 TWS 之后，我也无法再适应回去用有线耳机，有根线扯着，会极大降低我起身活动的频率。所以 TWS 真无线耳塞一直是我的心头好。
以我常玩的 PUBG 为例，PC 桌面端能用来打游戏的真无线耳塞，至少必须得延迟够低，才有可能听声辨位，这样的耳塞市面上少之又少。所以很自然地，踩中我的喜好和需求的怒喵 CYBERBLADE 在发售后，我第一时间就上手并主力用了一段时间。所以这篇文章，我想分享一些我的体验感受。内容比较主观，没有受任一方干涉。
先说结论：抛开前期我也不喜欢的营销方式不谈，上手后的 CYBERBLADE 本身没有让我失望。它主打的桌面端体验不错，实物的质感挺好，佩戴舒适度和音质也有超出我预期，虽然缺点短板都有，但它确实可以称得上是我用过的最好的 PC 桌面端 TWS，而且，没有之一。
我是不是说得太满？请注意定语——「PC 桌面端 TWS」。就像我刚说的，PC 桌面端、能低延迟打游戏的真无线耳塞，市面上的可选项就没两个，这个垂直细分品类太小众，愿意像怒喵这样认真做一个偏高端定位好产品的厂商，更是没有。
你可以说怒喵只是在讨巧，从成熟的音频市场，挑了个没什么竞争的品类来做，没啥了不起；但对我这种目标受众来说，有人做了我需要的东西，并且除了核心的桌面低延迟游戏体验 OK 之外，还做出了别家没有的特色，就很棒。

CYBERBLADE 到底是个怎样的 TWS 耳机？

这篇文章将介绍，我为什么以及如何将自动化数据处理应用到 Notion 当中。并通过我实际的案例，介绍自动化工具 Zapier 的用法，分享我的使用体验。
数据更新和维护的不智能，让 Notion 的使用体验变得糟糕
随着 Notion 功能的不断完善，越来越多的人会选择使用 Notion 作为自己的第二大脑。无论是构建个人的知识网络、保存整理数据信息、还是展示自己的数字世界的成就，这些场景中，Notion 提供的功能都显得游刃有余。此外，得益于 Notion 可以高度个人定制化以及提供在线编辑的特性，用 Notion 管理待办事项，规划日程，同步团队信息，乃至于记账、写博客这种更进阶的用法，使用 Notion 都可以让数据为用户服务，一切变得井井有条。
操作的不便
但是，所谓凡事有一利就有一弊。在 Notion 当中构建的精巧且复杂的数据库，不仅意味着数据在展示层面上的美观和应用层面上的便利，同时也意味着需要在数据的更新维护上花更多的时间和精力。
按照我自己的使用习惯，我在 Notion 当中搭建了任务管理的数据库和财务管理的数据库。这其中有着大量的数字格式的数据存储在其中。但是因为 Notion 当中并不支持直接将数据进行运算得出结果
例如，数字一栏记录的值是 100，并不能通过直接填写 「+10」得到 110，数字数据的更新是需要删除原有的数据，并把计算好的新结果填入原来的位置。

在 PC 端或网页端，这样的操作还勉强可以接受，但是在手机的 App 上，这样的操作就显得过于麻烦。更…</span>

沿江而行
如果你来武汉的时间只有一天，那去江边走上一天，便可以心中有谱地说出：我去过武汉了。那些或声势显赫或寂寂无名的景色，许许多多便是散布在长江汉水之畔的。
汉口江滩
漫步路线：江汉路-江汉关-武汉科学技术馆-汉口江滩
江汉路
每个城市里都有一条名号最响的路，在北京是王府井大街，在上海是南京路，在广州是上下九，在武汉自然就是江汉路了，江汉路很长，它的一头伸到了江边，另一头连着解放大道，被誉为「天下第一步行街」。江汉路在清末时期叫做广利巷，是商人集资修建来往贸易之用的。1861 年，汉口开埠之后，洋人也是看中了这里的临江的交通便利之处，便在广利巷附近的地盘上相继建立租界，江汉路便逐渐形成。现今江汉路著名的建筑，即是当年各个租界遗留的场所。
江汉路沿路与江汉一、二、三路，黎黄陂路，保成路，水塔街等道路相连。弯弯绕绕，一转身，便可以看到不同风景。黎黄陂路是旧时汉口俄租界上的街道改造而成，作为一条拥有百年历史的老路，黎黄陂路见证着滚滚的历史车轮从此经过，漫步在这里，主要体会宁静，在老时光咖啡馆里享受一段悠然时光，在小物商行里欣赏别出心裁的饰件，或是在路上发发呆，看一看那些时不时提着婚纱走过的新人。保成路是承袭了几十年不断演变的夜市，短短几百米的道路上承载了近千家小商贩，漫步在这里…</span>

Open source is a flourishing and beneficial ecosystem that publicly solves problems in communities and industries using software developed through a decentralized model and community contributions. Over the years, this ecosystem has grown in number and strength among hobbyists and professionals alike. It&#x27;s mainstream now—even proprietary companies use open source to build software.
With the ecosystem booming, many developers want to get in and build new open source projects. The question is: How do you achieve that successfully?
This article will demystify the lifecycle and structure of open source projects. I want to give you an overview of what goes on inside an open source proje…</span>

从这里开始
目前我在用的笔记系统，用一句很简单的话概括就是：本地 markdown 文件 + Dropbox 网盘同步，同时用 Vscode 项目把整个笔记目录管理起来。
大概几年前，我正在 Evernote 、有道云笔记、OneNote 之间反复横跳。当时还没有 Notion，也没有 Roam Research，甚至 PKM（个人知识管理）都很少有人提及。
最后还是选择了本地 markdown 这种「看似不便」的方式，毕竟原生的 markdown有种种缺点（图片管理、没有 Metadata、不支持复杂排版），本地文件的方式摆脱不了树状文件夹的笔记结构……甚至在当时缺少非常顺手的编辑器。但这些年修修补补也一直用下来了，上面提到的种种缺点也都改善或规避，期间也尝试过 Notion、RoamResearch、Logseq，但这种 「基于本地 markdown」的笔记一直都是我的笔记系统基本盘。

 
这种方案的好处是：

数据完全属于自己，Dropbox 网盘 + 自己写的定时脚本备份到 Git ，双重措施可以确保笔记不会丢失，也能通过 Git 的历史追溯修改历史、查看笔记系统的生长过程；
最好的同步体验（Dropbox） + 最好的现代编辑器（Vscode）：Dropbox 的多设备同步近乎实时，并且增量同步非常适合 markdown 这种轻量文本，如果上网不便可以用坚果等其他同步盘替代，如果你用 苹果全家桶且能忍受 iCloud Drive 的同步1，它也是可以的 。至于最好的编辑器……还是看个人习惯吧，现代的编辑器诸如 Su…</span>

                              <span>使用 Obsidian 的过程中发现一些痛点：
1&gt; 使用插件 annotator 时，引用的文本内不能添加链接

如果强行将关键字改成链接，就会出现格式错乱

我想要的效果如下：引用的文本能够给添加链接

2&gt; 使用简悦剪藏文章时 ，文章内的图片是外链。如果图片是外链，那么如果外链链接失效了就找不回图片了

我想要的效果如下：将外链转为图床的链接

3&gt; Media Extended 虽然能使用链接跳转到视频指定时间点，但是手写链接太麻烦了

我想要的效果：自动生成一个视频的全部字幕和引用，且每句字幕和一点时间点引用呈一一对应的关系

❗❗❗为了节省大家的时间，我在文末写了我常用的 Obsidian 插件的下载链接，这些插件中有部分插件的源码都是被我修改过的，有两个需要注意的事项：

被我修改过源码的插件不全是可以直接用的，比如发送图片到 Picgo 时的 url 要换成你在 Picgo 内设置的 url
修改过源码的插件不要升级，如果升级了会导致修改失效

❗❗❗再附加一个注意事项：

入门简悦的时候如果运气不好（比如我），会遇到很多问题，如果看了入门文章还是解决不了就到 https://github.com/Kenshin/simpread/issues 提交自己的问题，简悦的开发者回复消息还是挺快的（顺便夸夸开发者很积极，这很难得）

修改 annotator 引用格式
使用工具
Annotator：是一个用于给 pdf 做标注和跳转的开源插件
Linter：是一个用于格式化笔记的开源插件
配置 Linter
目标：修改其源代码，添加将 Annotator 样式修改为 📌
添加规则分类：

添加具体的规则处理：

代码如下：

                              <span>在以前的文章中，我对笔记软件和写作软件按照类别进行了梳理，参见《盘点那些具有特色的笔记软件》、《盘点那些具有特色的写作软件》。今天承接这一系列，介绍《盘点那些具有特色的电子白板软件》。
在思维导图、概念图之外，白板作为一种强大的思维辅助工具，正在日益流行。为什么很多人喜欢白板呢？
为什么需要白板？

自由。白板没有过多的束缚。就像在一张白纸一样。你可以在空白页面随心所欲地表达你的思想。
可视化。只需要使用画笔、文本框等模块以及模版，快速地将你地思维过程和想法以图文组合地方式加以表达。

事实上，白板也并非什么新鲜事务。很多公司一直在使用实体白板进行开会等活动。如今，随着工作方式的改变，人们在远程工作、远程教育等场景中迫切需要电子白板工具。
那么，如何选择适合自己的电子白板软件呢？我根据对于白板软件的使用需求，依次介绍本地离线的白板软件、免费/好用的在线白板软件、在线协作的白板软件，以满足对白板软件从轻量级到重量级等不同程度的需求。此外，还介绍两种与白板相关、特殊类型的工具：介于白板和笔记之间的可视化知识管理工具、内置白板模块的笔记软件。
本地离线的白板软件

先给大家展示我去年的一个成果——《御赐小仵作》资料整理。大家可以看看下面这几张动图：

页面详情可点击此链接查看：《御赐小仵作》资料整理
《御赐小仵作》是去年的一部古装悬疑连续剧，算得上是暑期档的最大黑马了。该剧的情节、设定和诸多细节都很讲究，所以我觉得有必要整理一番。一来是出于自己对这部作品的喜爱，二来是想让制作团队的用心能让更多人看到。
去年6月的时候我开始整理，本以为只需要一两个星期，实则大大低估了它的工作量。我那会每天大概抽出半个小时，磨了整整5个月才完成。不过虽然是挺累的，但整理完还是倍有成就感。这次的整理大致分为5个模块：

每集的剧情脉络
剧中重要人物的介绍
相关的历史背景和知识
唐代的官职制度
剧中所涉及的知识点

这几部分主要是通过 wolai 的「双向链接」和「嵌入引用」来实现联动。
比如第一集的剧情这里，红色的部分是双向链接，引用的有人物也有知识点。跳转到人物界面之后，可以看到 ta 的简介，以及相关的经历。人物经历下面通过「嵌入引用」，把剧情里的信息链接过来。因为这部剧的主旋律是验尸和破案，所以几个主角的经历还会分出「工作成果」这一部分。

wolai 是国内开发的一个云端协作平台，用来搭建知识体系也很适合。
2018年的时候我就开始搭建自己的数据库，从最初的印象笔记，到后来的 Onenote 和 Notion，一步步探索，最后在2020年选择了 wolai。

掐指一算，试播集 已经暂别我们两个多月了，在没有南哥发车的这些日子里，我攒了不少读书笔记，决定自发的搞一期 “备播集”，大约等同于电视台里没节目可播的时候强行凑数的节目。

如果大家对这样的形式喜闻乐见，也欢迎在各种渠道找到我，大家一起攒读书笔记并发出来，希望能坚持到试播集回来的那一天。最后也感谢南哥对本文头图的大力支持。

@kokdemo 创业者们的自述
最近看到了巴塔哥尼亚创始人决定把公司“捐给地球1”的新闻，让我感到颇为震撼，在看完新闻之后，我立马去阅读了巴塔哥尼亚创始人伊冯·乔伊纳德所著的《冲浪板上的公司》这本书。
巴塔哥尼亚官网的公告-地球是我们唯一的股东
在读完这本书之后，我对这家公司的文化和理念十分敬佩，于是打算将这一段时间读过的一些公司创始人所写的书放在一起，和大家聊一聊。

《Salesforce传奇》：作者是 Salesforce 创始人马克·贝尼奥夫。Salesforce 是软件即服务行业（SaaS）的先驱和佼佼者，创办于1999年，主要产品是客户管理系统（CRM）；Salesforce 在纽约证券交易所上市，目前市值 1470.10 亿美元。
《发明》：作者是 dyson 创始人詹姆斯戴森。戴森是一家专注家用电器的公司，创办于1991年，其推出的吸尘器、风扇、吹风机等广受好评。戴森仍然是一家私人家族公司，没有上市。

                              <span>你有没有想过一个问题：为什么心理学家都喜欢拿老鼠做实验？
一般来说会找一只涉世未深的小白鼠，然后把它放到一个箱子里，还会给它准备一些食物，但是食物会连上老鼠可操控的开关，并且加上电击、喂食等各种条件变量，然后通过设计不同的机制，来看老鼠最后的反应，最后老鼠会因此习得一些惯性的行为模式。
实验完成后，心理学家会把老鼠的这些行为反应总结成规律，然后应用和解释人类的行为和心理机制。
这些实验结论都有一个隐含的前提，那就是老鼠的心智模式在某种情况下，等同于人类的心智模式：都是通过先做一些行为，然后从现实世界获取「反馈」，然后建立对世界的「预测」机制，直到最后形成了一个「稳定」的行为模式。
为什么我们一定要经过反馈、预测、稳定的路径？因为不管是人类，还是老鼠，我们都会遵循一种固定的模式——心智模式。

心智模式是我们简化世界后的知识结构和认知表征，我们常用它来与世界进行互动。
——百度百科

人类如果要在现实世界中生存，就需要认识并且适应所处的不断变化的环境。我们能够通过五官觉察身边的环境，通过短时的记忆去存储一段时间已经发生的变化，然后通过思维去归纳和预测还未发生的变化，最后形成一套自己的心智模式。
可以说，我们只要想在这个世界上好好地活，就离不开我们的心智模式。
我们可以将现实世界投射在心智之中，但是尽管穷尽一生，我们的心智世界也只能涵盖真实世界的很小一部分。
很多时候，我们以为的真实世界其实并不真实。
心智以外的“真实”世界
楚门望着看起来一望无际的大海，不知道海的对面是一堵天蓝色的墙，墙上的楼梯能够通往现实世界。原来自己不过是一个被设定好的角色，眼前的一切都是人造的虚幻。如果周边的环境都是假的，那“我”还是真的吗？

作为观察楚门的看客，我们知道他身处的世界是假的，但我们怎么知道没有人在观察我们？也许是我们的灵魂？或者有某种更广泛的神秘的存在在操控我们的命运。
但我这里不想继…</span>

                              <span>在正式开始教程之前首先说明一下目前国行系统的状态：最新版三星云（5.2.00.5）屏蔽了OneDrive备份的入口，直接删除了相关备份软件的服务。因此要在国行系统机器上继续使用OneDrive备份需要降级三星云。如果对Samsung Pay没有需求而对同步有比较大的需求，最简单的方法是刷港版系统。本教程基于One UI 4.1，国行S20。所有需要的安装包均可在教程链接或者apkmirror网站上找到。
在开始之前需要的准备：一个非大陆地区的三星账号，一个微软账号（需要是个人账号），一个非国行系统的三星手机（也可以是你的国行设备刷港版系统），以及一部国行系统的三星手机（操作对象）。
第一步，绑定三星账号和微软账户。
在非国行系统的手机上登录三星账号，然后在相册的设置里，找到云同步，点击按照提示登录微软账户。其中某些步骤容易因为网络原因卡住，不过由于我从来没遇到过，所以有需求的建议在酷安上搜索相关资料，或者全程科学网络。这一步很简单，因此不做过多阐述。
第二步，降级三星云。
一般来说，国行系统的三星云会被强制自动更新，因此要想使用备份需要先降级三星云。
目前在apkmirror上找到能安装也能备份的最新版是5.1.00.13，由于版本号相比国行最新版三星云5.1.05.9更低，需要重新安装。可以现在系统里卸载三星云，再安装此版本的三星云。如果不想重新同步之前的云数据，可以使用ADB直接降级安装。代码我放在下面（为了方便输入，包名我改成了123.apk）
adb install -r -d D:\123.apk
第三步，在国行设备上进行后续操作。
登录账号之后，下载一个OneDrive，登录之前和三星账户绑定的那个微软账户。登录成功之后就可以暂时忽略这个软件。然后按照链接里的方法在手机上安装lycan，这一步是关键，否则之后的操作都无法进行。
https://www.coolapk.com/feed/32708070?shareKey&#x3D;YWUwNDI3ZTU5Y2FmNjMzMTVlN2M~&amp;shareUid&#x3D;964712&amp;shareFrom&#x3D;com.coolapk.app_5.0.2
下载「创建快捷方式」这个软件
【创建快捷方式】 ，打开之后右上角三个点勾选「也显示系统应用」，搜索三星云。点击进入三星云的活动列表，搜索「dashboard」，找到图中这个活动，然后创建一个快捷方式放在桌面。

如果此时打开这个快捷方式，会进入OneDrive同步的那个页面，但是会提示三星云需要更新才能同步，如果不更新就会强制退出。所以我们需要用到lycan屏蔽这个更新提示。
打开lycan，搜索三星云，在「服务」中将uploadtodrive两项设置成enable

在「接收器」中将下图三项禁用，三项名字均带有update

在「服务」中打开下图两项

此时重新打开刚刚那个快捷方式，就能够正常同步了。
成功效果如图

如果之后打开三星云又提示更新，可以按照之前的方法降级三星云。不排除之后的系统更新会屏蔽这个接口的可能，只能说且用且珍惜。</span>

                              <span>时间切片 Time Slice 是延时摄影的静态表现形式：你通过固定机位并在特定的时间间隔内拍摄一系列照片，得到一组静态照片，然后在后期的时候按照时间顺序，取每一张照片的局部，然后拼接起来，便得到一个名为时间切片的照片。
2022 年 7 月份在梧桐山顶拍摄了一组日落时分的延时照片，并在后期导入电脑并使用 DaVinci Resolve 合成延时视频的时候，我突然想起一个朋友在 2013 年输出的一个时间切片照片。于是也想给我这组照片制作一个时间切片。
后期制作时间切片是一道很复杂的工程（比如，可以参考这里），随着照片数目的增多，操作步骤会越多。在正式使用 Photoshop 尝试制作时间切片之前，我就直接有个想法，要不自己实现一把？
事实上，使用程序来实现一点都不难：给一组照片排好序后，在一个大的画布上，依次取该照片特定的区域，然后绘制到该画布的同样的区域就能实现这种效果。最开始我是在 Android 上进行这块的测试，后来很快就完成并验证了效果的可用性。后来想了下，MyerTidy 虽然目前的功能只有「整理文件」，但它实际上是可以定位为一个「批量处理」的 app。
最后便有了 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新（暂时只有 macOS 版本）。
此版本带来以下的变化：

重新设计的带响应式布局的首页，为未来支持更多批量操作进行前置的支持
新增各个模式的功能介绍以及效果图
支持「延时切片」功能，正如上文所说的，可以为你制作时间切片照片。在下文会做更详细的介绍
进行了小部分重构和性能优化

在首页选择了「延时切片」后，你便可以选择一个文件夹或者一组照片了，之后会自动进行预览渲染：

 
默认的效果是，根据你的文件名升序排序，从左到右，不对图片进行采样来进行绘制。
比如你有文件名为 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg 到 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg 的 100 张图片，会使用以下顺序从左到右来绘制：

绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg
绘制 TIMELAPSE_002.jpg
…
绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg

效果如上。
 
你可以点击「倒序处理」，来使用倒序的方式来从左到右绘制：

绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg
绘制 TIMELAPSE_099.jpg
…
绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg

效果如下：

 
如果你觉得你的图片太多了，想以固定的间隔来取一部分来绘制，那么可以在「跳过合成的数目」来输入你要跳过的数目 X。也就是，每隔 X 张，只会取一张来绘制。

跳过的数目为 5 的情况下，每 5 张会选择第一张来绘制。
对于上述图片，跳过数目设定为 50 的时候（原图片总数目为 654 张）效果如下：

 
最后，上述的布局方式都是「水平布局」：图片以水平方向来进行绘制。
你可以点击「垂直布局」，来开启从上到下的绘制模式，效果如下：

此外特别注意的一点是，MyerTidy 目前不支持图片自动对齐。因此如果你的图片组因为前期拍摄的原因有部分图片对不齐，那么需要你先使用 Photoshop 等工具来前期做对齐（当然，相比做时间切片来说，应该不算太困难）。如果需求强烈，那么可能会调研并加入这块的支持。
以上便是 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新。未来会专注 macOS 下对文件和图片的「批处理」的实现，目前期望会做的下一个大功能便是对文件按照特定的规则批量重命名（比如整理番剧之类的，会很有用），也在思考是否可以加入类似「星轨合成」这样的功能。
你可以通过 App Store 搜索 MyerTidy 来进行下载。如果你有什么想法和反馈，欢迎留言。</span>

                              <span>1. 两个让我困惑的迷思
在双链笔记兴起后，PKM 领域一直热衷于谈论知识与知识间的联系构建。于是我们经常听到一种流行的讲法：我们的思维方式是网状的，笔记也应如此，传统的文件夹与目录分类已是旧时代的产物。
这种讲法忽视了两个前提：
并不是所有人都有能力在知识间构建联系，尤其对于一个领域的初学者来说；
大脑神经元虽然以网状的形式呈现，但人类的思考方式本质上仍然是结构化的；
20 世纪 50 年代，芝加哥大学教授布鲁姆提出教育目标分类理论，该理论将人类对于知识的认知分为了六个层次：

记忆：对具体事实、概念、术语的回忆；
理解：能够对知识进行转换、解释和推断；
应用：在实际情景中运用知识；
分析：将所学材料分解，明白各部分间的联系；
评价：基于对知识的理解，对知识的价值进行有效判断；
创造：将组成知识的各部分要素重新加工，产生新的模式或结构；

按照布鲁姆的分类理论，知识间如果要产生关联，对于知识的认知必须要达到分析的层次。在实际应用中，我们也许可以跳过记忆和应用，将认知过程的前四步简化为理解-&gt;分析，然而这仍然要求我们对知识有充分的吸收和了解。
以语法为例，若我们想要厘清中、英文之间的差异，则必先以其中一种语言作为理解的锚点。对一方的语法有所了解后，才可借此反思与另一方语言的相同、区别。
如此，作为一个初学者，若对两种语言皆不通晓，自然很难有相互关联的能力。再者，一个领域本身有其自身的框架，初学者面对新知尚且招架不住，更遑论还要再负担额外的功夫去思考相关性。
更令人困惑的迷思在于，当我们谈论联系时，我们总是通过网的比喻来形容知识的关联性。

                              <span>在这个大众觉醒的时代，我们常常听到「我们需要探索自我，了解自己」。但是，假设我们很粗暴地把人分为三种：认为不需要寻找自我的人（或不知道「寻找自我」重要性的人）、正在寻找自我的人、以及找到了自我的人，第一类人是绝大多数，第二类是少数，第三类是少数中的少数。
这其实也对应了我们认识自我的三个阶段。
第一阶段是我们需要觉醒，意识到探索自我的重要性。
为什么探索自我对每个人都很重要？
人是需要意义驱动的动物，我们天生有实现自身价值的冲动。但每个人的价值、优势是不同的。我的性格是怎样的？我想做的事情是什么？对我来说，什么最重要？我未来的方向是什么？我想过上怎么样的生活？我的价值实现在哪？这些问题如果得不到解答，短短一生很容易忙忙碌碌、随着大流就这样过去了，实在可惜。
项飙在《把自己作为方法》中说：

（瓶颈的问题）是回到自己作为一个边缘者、回到我是谁的问题。想清楚究竟我能做什么，我跟世界的关系是什么。我认为世界上所有的人都有这个问题，都得搞清楚自己是谁，否则都会有这种危机，除非完全盲目地被主流裹挟进去。

当我们意识到探索自我的需求之后，我们还需要方法，这就来到了第二阶段——开始寻找自我。但我感觉，很多人对于探索自我的方法却没有什么头绪。
困难之处，在于「自我」是非常复杂的，我们之所以是今天这样，受到了童年经历、社交媒体、朋友亲人、国家文化等等各种因素的影响，这些影响之中大部分更是在日常不知不觉之中就成为了我们的一部分，所以无论是从横向（各种因素的复杂性）和纵向（性格和价值观形成过程的复杂性）看，自我都是极其复杂的。
但好在，这几年通过各种各样的渠道和自证，我积累了一些有用的、可执行的方法，想在这里分享给你。
再多读几本书
阅读有什么用呢？学习知识肯定是好处之一，可是看完可能就忘了；拓展眼界也是的，可是没去亲身经历还是差了一点。
那最大的用处是什么呢？我认为， 是读自己。
