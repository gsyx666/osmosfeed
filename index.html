In a few short years, TikTok has grown into one of the fastest-growing social networks in the world — and with the 2022 midterm election cycle heating up, the app is now preparing to take on the maddening problem of election misinformation. 
In a Wednesday blog post, TikTok’s head of US safety, Eric Han, outlined how the company plans to combat the threat of harmful misinformation. First, TikTok will begin rolling out its Election Center this week in order to provide authoritative voting information in the coming weeks and results from the Associated Press once they are reported. TikTok says it will link out to the Election Center through labels placed on midterm-related content, including videos posted by governments, candidates, and...

Airbnb is testing new “anti-party technology” in the US and Canada as it attempts to enforce a global ban on house parties it made permanent earlier this year, the company has announced. The technology is designed to automatically catch the kinds of bookings that are likely to result in unauthorized parties, by looking at factors like a guests’ review history, the age of their account, the length of the stay they’re requesting, and whether they’re booking for a weekday or weekend.
The company says it’s been trialing similar technology in select areas of Australia since October 2021, where it saw a 35 percent drop in unauthorized parties. It’s also previously used a similar system in the US since July 2020 that has a more limited focus on...

Microsoft is rolling out a taskbar notification system to its Windows 11 widgets this week. While the weather widget returned to Windows 11 earlier this year, it’s largely been a static experience that displays a sunny icon when the weather is good and an umbrella icon when it’s raining and sucks to be outside. That’s all changing this week, as Microsoft is now adding live animations to this taskbar widget.
All Windows 11 users will start to see these new widget notifications in the coming days and weeks, thanks to an update to the Windows Web Experience Pack that powers Microsoft’s widgets feature. The notifications appear as live animations on the taskbar weather widget, and include alerts for thunderstorms and even ticker alerts when...

Most popular period and pregnancy tracking apps don’t have strong privacy protections, according to a new analysis from researchers at Mozilla. Leaky privacy policies in health apps are always a problem, but issues that fall into this particular category are especially concerning now that abortion is illegal in many places in the United States. 
Period and pregnancy tracking apps collect data that could theoretically be used to prosecute people getting abortions in places where it’s illegal. Data from period tracking apps isn’t the biggest thing used to tie people to abortions right now — most often, the digital data used in those cases comes from texts, Google searches, or Facebook messages. But they’re still potential risks.

Logitech has announced the Chorus, a $99 audio accessory that aims to bolster sound quality coming out of the Meta Quest 2 VR headset. The appeal of the Chorus, as opposed to using over-ear or in-ear headphones you may already own, is that it lets you remain more present in reality with its open-back, off-ear speakers a la Valve Index. 
It slides onto each side of the VR headset (compatible with the stock strap or Meta’s Elite straps), and the speakers can swivel to find the right positioning for your ears. Their volume is controlled through the Quest 2’s volume rocker. It’s powered via the Quest 2’s USB-C port, though it supports USB-C passthrough, so you can keep your headset charged or connect other devices to it.

Ultimate Ears just announced the Wonderboom 3, the latest iteration of its beloved entry-level portable speaker that promises high-quality 360-degree audio and up to 14 hours of battery life in an adorably compact package that still floats on water.
Strangely, the Microboom 3 still uses a Micro USB connection in our good year of 2022. It feels a little…well, lazy to carry over the same unfriendly port from the Wonderboom 2 when USB-C is available and mandated on portable speakers in Europe starting in 2024.
The third-generation Wonderboom does offer a few improvements over the Wonderboom 2 while keeping the price unchanged at $99.99. Bluetooth range is now 131 feet (up from the 100-foot range on the Wonderboom 2), and listed battery life...

Elon Musk’s lawyers notched a partial win this week in their Delaware Court of Chancery standoff against Twitter with a motion requesting information from 22 Twitter employees, or “custodians,” in addition to 41 others that both sides already agreed on for sharing data. Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled on the issue Monday afternoon, deciding Twitter has to “collect, review, and produce documents” from just one of the people listed: Kayvon Beykpour, the former head of consumer product at Twitter.
With the October 17th trial date for Twitter’s lawsuit against Musk for trying to break up their $44 billion deal drawing closer — and Musk selling billions of dollars worth of his stock in Tesla — his lawyers are trying to find something to shore...

There are many reasons to use AWS S3 for storage.
Security: S3 offers a number of security features, including server side encryption, bucket policies, and IAM roles that help you keep your data secure.
Performance: S3 is designed to offer excellent performance, with low latency and high throughput. 
Cost effective: S3 is very cost effective, with a pay as you go pricing model that charges you only for the storage you use. 
flexibility: S3 offers a number of features that make it easy to use for a wide range of applications, including support for static websites, streaming data, and disaster recovery.
Once you have created a bucket, you can upload objects to it. To upload an object, you need to specify the object&#x27;s key and file path. The key is used to uniquel…</span>

Git repository is like a data structure that VCS uses to store metadata for a set of files and directories. Contains a collection of  files and a history of changes made to those files.
This git repository can then be a remote repository stored on a code hosting service like Github, BitBucket, etc. 
The advantage of storing your git repository on a code hosting services like Github is to promote collaboration whereas it will be a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes among the files. 
Having a central code repository is essential part of development. Hence this needs to be planned well. 
In our case, we have our private Github organization where we store our project codes and we have a requirement to synchronized it to another rep…</span>

Unfortunately, I could not solve all their problems but I&#x27;ve tried to solve one of them.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a while since AI has found its importance in the manufacturing sector. AI in manufacturing has a lot to explore as it uses technology to automate manual and complex tasks which earlier were time taking and required lots of effort. Artificial Intelligence in the manufacturing sector also helps in developing efficient and systematic processes. Until now, the manufacturing sector was facing issues in managing the inventory which AI has successfully marked and resolved. Also, the day-by-day increasing demands of the consumers require a good boost in manufacturing and production rate, and AI really helps in meeting the ever-growing demands of the consumers and delivering what the end customer really needs.
Talking about the numbers, as of now, more than 60% of manufacturing companies …</span>

                              <span>DevOps is speeding up the application lifecycle and automated code testing. There are multiple contributors to a single software project and therefore, monitoring systems are now indispensable in every part of the DevOps toolchain.
Monitoring systems connect the departments working in silos as teams to perform and prevent broken production changes.
As the software infrastructure gets complex, there&#x27;s a need to regulate more features and automation to track everything from strategy to development, integration to testing, and deployment to operations.
That&#x27;s where DevOps monitoring has a role to play. The purpose of DevOps monitoring is to keep track of the entirety of the development process which includes-

A pre signed URL allow you to share the content of your bucket  so that friends and families can  view it for a limited period of time.  It is a time stamped public link giving outsider a limited access to a content hosted on AWS S3 bucket. 
Head to  your AWS S3 portal and create an a bucket. Make  Make sure to select the region you wish to have the bucket hosted. 
Bucket names must be between 3 (min) and 63 (max) characters long.
Bucket names can consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, dots (.), and hyphens (-).
Bucket names must begin and end with a letter or number.
Bucket names must not contain two adjacent periods.
Bucket names must not be formatted as an IP address (for example, 192.168.5.4).
Bucket names must not start with the prefix xn--.

                              <span>作为一个吸睛的音乐小部件（或控制器） —— 这是 Sunamu 唯一专注的事情，它工作得很好。

Sunamu 是一个有趣的工具。它不是音乐播放器，但可让你显示正在播放的音乐并对其进行控制。

我不喜欢在我的主要工作区使用浮动小部件，但 Sunamu 简约而优雅的方法改变了我的想法！

因此，我将向你介绍它的功能、安装、配置调整以及我的使用经验。

Sunamu：开源音乐控制器



正如你在上面的截图中所注意到的，它看起来是一种显示正在播放的音乐的非常好的方式，带有歌词，同时具有基本的控件。

你可以播放/暂停、转到下一首/上一首曲目、随机播放和启用循环。

Sunamu 支持多种音频平台，包括 Spotify。它还可以检测本地收藏中的音乐，支持一些可用于 Linux 的 最佳音乐播放器。

此外，它还支持 Windows。因此，如果你通过 Windows 上的 Edge 浏览器流式传输某些内容，它应该可以正常工作。

你可以查看其 GitHub 页面上的 兼容性列表 以了解有关支持的播放器和浏览器的更多信息。

幸运的是，你不必受限于它默认提供的功能。它提供了一种调整配置文件的简单方法（在其 GitHub 页面 上可以了解更多信息）。这使得新手可以调整一些设置并获得乐趣。

我将在本文的后面部分提到一些关于它的技巧。

Sunamu 的特点



Sunamu 具有一些不错的特性，其中一些是：


检测并显示当前正在播放的歌曲。

从专辑封面中获取配色方案，并使用相同的调色板以获得更好的视觉效果。

可通过配置文件进行定制。

与 Discord 完美集成。

消耗最少的系统资源。


在 Linux 上安装 Sunamu



它提供 AppImage、deb 和 rpm 包，以便在各种 Linux 发行版中轻松安装。我使用 AppImage 进行测试，并且非常好用。

如果你是 Linux 新手，你还可以从我们关于 如何使用 AppImage 或 安装 deb 包、rpm 包 的指南中得到帮助。

有趣的是，Sunamu 是少数为基于 ARM 的机器提供直接支持的开源音乐工具之一。

访问他们的 GitHub 发布页面下载包或从源代码构建它。

让我通过终端向你展示基于 Debian 的发行版的快速安装方法。只需按照给定的说明进行操作，你就可以开始使用了：

首先，让我们使用 wget 命令下载 .deb 包，如下所示：

wget https://github.com/NyaomiDEV/Sunamu/releases/download/v2.0.0/sunamu_2.0.0_amd64.deb


下载完包后，使用给定的命令进行安装：

sudo dpkg -i sunamu_2.0.0_amd64.deb




技巧：调整配置文件

默认情况下，Sunamu 不会从专辑封面中获取颜色，而是显示每首歌曲的歌词。和许多其他人一样，我喜欢不看歌词。

Sunamu 的配置文件通常位于 ~/.config/sunamu/config.json5。

要打开 Sunamu 配置文件，请输入给定的命令：

nano ~/.config/sunamu/config.json5


如下所示在 electron 部分进行更改（启用颜色并禁用歌词）：

electron: {
      type: &#x27;electron&#x27;,
      widgetMode: true,
      colors: true,
      font: &#x27;&#x27;,
      theme: &#x27;default&#x27;,
      showLyrics: false,
    }


这是最终配置文件的样子：



总结

除非你是避免使用基于 Electron 应用的人，否则 Sunamu 是一款足以增强你在 Linux 上的音乐体验的应用。继 Amberol 之后，这是我最近喜欢的第二款音乐相关应用。

如果你尝试过，请不要忘记在评论部分分享你的经验。

                              <span>以下是从 Linux 命令行自动编辑文件的一些提示和技巧。


当我使用 Linux 命令行时，无论是在台式机上编写新程序还是在 Web 服务器上管理网站，我经常需要处理文本文件。Linux 提供了强大的工具，我可以利用这些工具来完成我的工作。我经常使用 sed，一个可以根据模式修改文本的编辑器。

sed 代表 流编辑器Stream EDitor，它编辑文件中的文本并打印结果。使用 sed 的一种方法是识别一个字符串在文件中的几次出现，并将它们替换为不同的字符串。使用 sed 来处理文本文件的方式似乎是无穷无尽的，但我想分享一些使用 sed 来帮助我管理文件的方法。

在 Linux 上搜索和替换文件中的文本

要使用 sed，你需要使用一个正则表达式。正则表达式是定义模式的一组特殊字符。我最常使用 sed 的例子是替换文件中的文本。替换文本的语法如下：s/originaltext/newtext。s 告诉 sed 执行文本替换或交换出现的文本。在斜线之间提供原始文本和新文本。

此语法将仅替换每行中第一次出现的 originaltext。要替换每个匹配项，即使在一行中原始文本出现了不止一次，要将 g 追加到表达式的末尾。例如：s/originaltext/newtext/g。

要在 sed 中使用此表达式，请使用 -e 选项指定此正则表达式：

$ sed -e &#x27;s/originaltext/newtext/g&#x27;


例如，假设我有一个名为 game 程序的 Makefile 文件，该程序模拟了康威的《生命游戏》：

.PHONY: all run clean

all: game

game: game.o
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o game game.o $(LDFLAGS)

run: game…</span>

When it comes to time synchronization for embedded systems in a distributed architecture, there are &quot;soft&quot; use cases (typical, everyday devices) and complex, or &quot;hard,&quot; use cases (car brake systems, aerospace). It&#x27;s easy to see that a hard use case has unique requirements and a low tolerance for latency. To put it another way, hard use cases have hard, real-time constraints.
Latency is the bitter enemy of real-time computation. Latency, in the context of a critical real-time application, is the time between data generation and data reception. The reality is that when there is an interconnected network of several systems, there&#x27;s l…</span>

While working on the open source ZenTao project, I get constant feedback that getting Agile up and running is a big task in many organizations. As with any new process, you will run into issues, and many of them will feel unique to your organization. While context is important, there&#x27;s a certain amount of abstraction possible after you&#x27;ve coached enough teams. This article covers the four most common issues I&#x27;ve encountered. While your Agile coach should analyze any actual problems in the context of your organization, knowing these general issues can help better prepare you and your teams for the transitional process.
Note that I only discuss is…</span>

                              <span>本文参与数字文具盒征文活动。

我是一个在读的社科博士生。大约一年多以前，我正式进入到博士研究的阶段。很快我发现，博士与硕士本科阶段不同，我面临着文章发表的压力却又缺乏充分的导师指导，由此我开始认真思考如何建立自己的知识管理与任务管理系统。感谢少数派上众多热心作者的分享，让我在这一年里了解并尝试了各种各样的笔记工具、任务管理工具以及方法论体系，并成功浪费了大量学习时间。
然而，虽然每次看到喜欢的新工具都会马上下载使用，我却总是难以坚持下来。在经历了无数次的尝试-放弃循环后，我发觉最重要的不是工具本身，而是容纳这些工具的「盒子」——即如何最简单明了地将文件管理、项目管理、知识管理等等工具融合在一起。
但恰恰是这些基础的东西，大部分的分享都没有详细提及，它们可能没有什么技术含量，但却是入门者最最需要的。因此，我想和大家分享一下我是如何将 Mac 桌面作为我的数字文具盒，搭建简易数字化学术工作流程的，或许能对刚开始入门的朋友有所帮助。
首先谈谈一个普遍存在的问题：

为什么我看到某某博主介绍的某款笔记工具非常酷炫，非常符合自己的需求，但是就是用不下去呢？

可能有这几方面的原因：

工具学习成本过高，难以上手。
工具与自己正在使用的工具功能、工作习惯冲突，无法完全融入到自己的工作流中。
自己太懒工具使用需要耗费时间精力，没有养成使用习惯，产生拖延。

就我自己的探索经历来说，这几方面的问题一般共同存在。
举个例子，初次知道 logseq 这个双链笔记应用的时候，我觉得它就是完美的笔记工具，于是马上下载试用，每天在它的 dailynote 里面记录各种各样的东西，包括每日任务、未来计划、会议记录、研究灵感、阅读笔记，项目总结等等，然后用双链加以整理。
但是一段时间后发现，它和之前的工具产生了冲突。比如我的文献 pdf 是用 Zotero 来管理的，这就导致每次查阅文献都要同时打开两…</span>

When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. 
Amazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. 
Below, we’ve listed each model currently available. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one or any of the products — which is...

If you spent Tuesday wondering why your Fitbit Charge 5 won’t sync, you’re not alone. Frustrated Charge 5 owners have taken to Reddit and Twitter to report their fitness trackers simply won’t sync in what appears to be a widespread outage. It’s the latest in a series of complaints this summer following slow Ionic recalls and messed-up blood oxygen graphs for Android users.
The Verge was able to confirm that at least two of our Charge 5 devices are unable to sync on both Android and iOS despite multiple efforts. We were last able to sync a device at 10:39PM ET on Monday night. Unpairing and repairing the Charge 5 as well as force quitting the Fitbit app were unsuccessful in fixing the issue. 
Around 4:45PM ET, the Fitbit Support account t...

WhatsApp’s new app on Windows no longer requires you to link your phone to send, receive, and sync messages. An update on WhatsApp’s site reveals the refreshed Windows app is out of beta and available to download on the Microsoft Store.

                              <span>http://situationlab.org/project/... I made a printable cool version.

I publish the product on Gumroad, for the next situation:

On the past may I get my degree as Software Developer, the journey has just begun, and my laptop is a piece of shit, to develop web stuff is almost impossible, I got to render my projects mentally because if I run the web server and the REST API server my Linux crashes ( just a sample, many others situations fit on it ) I tried everything, use vim instead vscode, even with vim nothing goes okay, mobile development no way, fortunately my stay on my college was very light they have many cool machines.

I have this laptop since 2015, the battery doesn&#x27;t work anymore, I must have every time the charger connected, this is the super machine:

--- https://www.notebookcheck.net/HP... ---

I sold my personal stuff, I made some websites as freelancer, and even I sold my soul and nothing, my budget still don&#x27;t reach the goal, to be honest I dream with an apple product ( MacBook Air ) but doesn&#x27;t matter, any machine is better than my own.     

I have many wishes to play with open source, help the other developers, and I have many interesting projects to publish ( some of them already published, look my GitHub or my ProductHunt profile ) and work of course.

Please help me, I don&#x27;t know how to handle this situation, my daily mood is on base how my machine works, you know how works this life to be developer, if you don&#x27;t have a good machine you are broke, I feel how if I am living on the past, every day new frameworks, libraries, tools come to light, and I can&#x27;t play with them. 

A big and warm hug from Mexico :)

★ Introduction about Reading Buddy

- ReadingBuddy simulates many scientific speed reading techniques such as Meta Guiding, and Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) to help you read faster with high comprehension

- Accelerate your learning and life with our speed reading scientific methodologies designed for busy people who want to achieve more in less time.

★ Main features

⚡️ Reading pointer: Reading Buddy simulates the best speed reading technique called Meta Guiding.

Meta guiding involves visually guiding your eye using some sort of pointer (finger, pen, or this Reading Buddy app) for the eye to move faster along the length of a passage of text.



The point is to decrease distraction and focus on the specific words to increase your reading speed. Try to keep moving your pointer slightly faster than your comfort zone to increase the reading speed.

⚡️ Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP): In RSVP, a series of words appear rapidly in time at the same point in visual space. Indeed, the words may appear as fast as 10 items per second.




⚡️ Reading Mode: distraction-free &amp; ad-blocking reading viewer focusing on the main content.

⚡️ Reading Analytics: Keep track of your reading goals including total words and words per minute daily, weekly, and monthly 

We recommend moving your pointer with almost constant speed. Try to keep moving your pointer slightly faster than your comfort zone to increase the reading speed.  

Try to read faster so that you catch up with your pointer. If you start losing comprehension, slow your pointer down. Otherwise, consider moving your pointer even faster.

★ Privacy &amp; Support

What you read is your business.

We do not sell, rent, license, or otherwise monetize your data in any way.

By installing the extension, you agree to Reading Buddy&#x27;s Privacy Policy.

                              <span>@hainingmax. He&#x27;s an OG in no-code world and has helped thousands of Makers get started building their own products. 

One of the biggest questions I see get asked all the time is what can be built with no-code? There isn&#x27;t a better way to explain than show what is possible. Seeing what you can do and how you can do it is how I learned how to build my own things. And there isn&#x27;t anything more empowering than that. 

Cheers to Max for putting together this product. I hope that it helps you bring your idea to life by seeing what is possible.

                              <span>Linus 发布 Linux 6.0 的第一个候选版本

Linus Torvalds 说主版本的变化并不意味着这个版本有什么根本不同，他说，“我早就摒弃了‘主要版本号是有意义的’概念，使用分层版本号的唯一原因是它更容易记忆和区分”。他也表示，一些中国开发者建议采用 5.20 版本号，他说“因此，如果你想把这个叫做 ‘Linux 5.20’，那你继续好了”。该版本包括了 13,099 个更改的文件，这意味着“6.0 看起来是又一个相当大的版本”。大部分的更新是对 GPU、网络和声音的改进。他对一些支持 Rust 的代码没有进入该版本表示遗憾，“我希望我们能得到一些最早的 Rust 基础设施，以及多代 LRU 虚拟机，但这两个都没能进入”。

AI 可以使未来的消防员免于致命的燃爆

当房间里的可燃材料突然开始一次性点燃时，就会发生燃爆，并产生大量的热量和可燃气体爆炸，可能会打破墙壁和窗户。据估计，消防员受伤事故中有 13% 是燃爆造成的。来自美国 NIST、谷歌以及香港理工大学和中国石油大学的研究人员，建立了一个使用图神经网络（GNN）的系统，从模拟火灾中学习不同的数据来源之间的关系。他们使用了 25,000 个火灾案例来训练模型。初步结果显示，该模型的准确率最高为 92.1%，可以检测未来 30 秒内是否会发生燃爆。

老王点评：非常有意义的研究，这比用 AI 来聊天更具有价值。另外，图神经网络似乎是个很有希望的技术。




谷歌发布 Android 13，源代码已发布到 AOSP

Android 13 开始推送给谷歌的智能手机 Pixel 系列，今年晚些时候，主要厂商三星、小米、一加等也会给旗下部分型号手机更新 Android 13。新变化包括：自定义非谷歌应用匹配墙纸主题和颜色，允许给应用分配与系统不同的语言，设定应用只能访问特定照片和视频，剪切板拷贝的敏感数据会在一定时间后自动清除，等等。Android 13 的源代码已经发布到了安卓开源项目（AOSP）。

                              <span>在中国，有各种节日，有各种情人节。

最早是从西方传来的所谓公历 2.14 的“情人节”，后来又有了 3.14 的“白色情人节”。然后，人们觉得这些节的洋味太重，何不把中国的农历七夕当成中国传统的情人节呢？而随着二次元一代，谐音梗也开始流行，不知道是谁滥觞，5.20 也被当成了一种情人节，因为谐音是“我爱您”。

前几天，我的朋友 aulus Wren 跟我说，有位内核开发者在 Linux 内核邮件列表中向 Linus Torvalds 请求，将刚刚准备进位到 6.0 的版本号在 5.20 上停留一次，他认为这是一个在中国宣传 Linux 的好机会。就在前几天，Linus Torvalds 刚刚在邮件列表中 宣布 了 Linux 5.19 正式发布，并通告下一个版本准备“进位”到 6.0 了。

说起来 Linux 内核的版本号，比较有意思的是从 3.0 开始主版本号就没有什么特别的意义，只是当次版本号太大时，Linus 觉得过大的数字会让他困扰，因此就“进位”到主版本号了。比如，2.6.39 之后就是 3.0，3.19 之后就是 4.0，4.20 之后就是 5.0（之所以没有在 4.19 就开始进位，也许是 Linus 忘记了）。所以，按照这种不严格的 20 进制，该进位了。

这位名叫 Zhang Boyang（让我们称他为“张同学”）的内核开发者在内核邮件列表中向 Linus Torvalds 发起倡议：


您能不能考虑使用 5.20 作为下一个 Linux 版本号，而不是 6.0。“5.20” 这个数字在中文中是一个文字游戏，代表 “我爱您”，所以 “Linux 5.20” 在中文中可以被读作 “我爱 Linux”。 


他认为，这可以引起一些广泛传播，可以宣传 Linux。这个 消息 传播到国内后，褒贬不一，有人认为这是一件有趣的事情，可以向更多不了解 Linux 的人宣传 Linux；也有人认为，这事太无聊了。

但是这封邮件并未带来什么影响，可能是它发出的时间恰逢周末，也没有得到 Linus Torvalds 的回复。

眼看过去了一周，合并窗口接近关闭了，看来修改版本号这件事希望渺茫，张同学 再次发出 了他的倡议，请 Linus Torvalds 考虑给该版本一个命名：


您能不能考虑将下一个 Linux 版本（5.20 或 6.0）命名为 “I love linux”？……即使下一个内核版本号是 6.0，我想对于讲中文的人和不讲中文的人来说，表达我们对 Linux 内核的爱可能都是一个好主意。


而历史上，Linux 内核的一些版本有特别的名称，比如 Linux 5.17 就被命名为 “Superb Owl”（“超级碗”的一个文字游戏）。

这一次，他的邮件得到了六位中国的 Linux 内核开发者的支持。但是，依旧没有得到 Linus 和其它国家开发者的回应。

在大家的回应中，有人对 5.20 这个节日做了进一步解释，以及表达了一个并不浪漫的已婚男人对各种情人节的紧张，并表示这样的 520 挺好，不需要专门准备礼物。也有人表示，这是内核列表里面一次较大规模的“文化输出”，就像我们对美国人的“超级碗”无感一样，外国人对我们的 520可能也没什么感受。

原本，我以为，这件事就此作罢了。不料 Linus Torvalds 在昨天发布 Linux 6.0-rc1 时，专门提到了这件事，他说，


如果你愿意，你可以继续叫它 “Linux 5.20”。


并且，Linus Torvalds 在这份公告里面再次重申了，主版本号变化并不代表有根本性的变化，他早就摒弃了“主版本号是有意义的”的说法了，而采用分层的版本号只是为了使版本号容易记忆而已。

老王觉得，张同学这件事办的很好，诸位在内核邮件列表回复的同学也很给力。说到底，我们对 Linux 就是一种热爱，为什么不借着各种可能的机会来宣传它呢？虽然，Linux 越来越用在各种严肃的场合，但是 Linux，乃至开源，其本底一直是一种极客文化，“Just for Fun”，所以，为什么不呢？虽然，由于文化差异，没有得到太多的回应，但是我们的“文化输出”才能让世界对我们有更多的亲近。

那么，你的看法呢？

另外，你认为这样的版本号有趣吗？你会向你的爱人（如果不是计算机的话）讲这个故事吗？为了这个有爱的版本号，你是否会为 Linux 内核或更广泛的 Linux 做些什么吗（比如去修个 Bug，让你的痕迹留在 Linux 5.20 中）？

                              <span>Inkscape 是 Fedora 设计团队最喜爱最常用的软件，它的功能可不止于制作精美的矢量图形。矢量图形（也就是 SVG 文件）可以帮助实现更多操作，许多软件也支持这一格式。不过，Inkscape 还有其他功能有待发掘。本系列 第一篇文章介绍了如何 使用 Inkscape 生成 GCode 文件；本篇文章将探索 Inkscape 的另一项扩展功能：用于绣花设计的 Ink/Stitch。

绣花 DIY

在过去数年里，DIY 风靡一时。可以说，这一现象始于廉价的 3D 打印 技术，以及后来的 数控 机床与激光切割机、激光雕刻机。这些设备都算不上非常昂贵。同时，绣花机等“传统”机器的价格也有下降。家用绣花机现在只需 500 美元就能买到了。

如果你不想买或者买不到绣花机，离你最近的 创客空间 一般也会有。即便是一台商用单头绣花机，价格也下降到了 5000 美元。对于购置绣花机这种投资来说，一般很快就能看到回报。

绣花设计软件

一些家用绣花机附有配套的绣花设计软件，不过大部分都只能在 Windows 系统上运行，就算该领域最常用的、独立于各绣花机制造商的软件 Embird 也是如此。不过，你也可以通过 Wine 来运行这些软件。

在 Linux 上，另一个办法就是使用 Embroidermodde。不过，该软件在 2014 年的募捐活动之后，就停止了开发活动。

到今天，只剩下一个办法：Ink/Stitch



开源与绣花设计

绣花机价格高以及 Linux 用户少都怪不得制造商，毕竟为 Linux 开发应用的确不太值得。

绣花文件格式问题

绣花机所用文件格式大量涌现，甚至还有一些制造商为自家机器定制了文件格式。在某些情况下，即便是一家制造商，可能也会使用多种文件格式。

一、基调
Hello~我是小木箱，今天分享的主要内容是: 手把手教你快速搞定4个职场写作场景。在讲具体内容前先介绍一个词基调，什么是基调呢？百度百科的解释是作品中主要的音调。在写作里面，基调就是写作时的基本思想。艺术作品需要它独特的基调，写作也需要它独特的基调。

如果我们在写作之前，提前掌握了内容的基调，那么便把握了文章的命脉。开始写作后的大方向是一定不会错的。
二、四类常见的职场写作
职场写作在类型上分为四大类: 总结类、调查报告类、申请类和计划类。

我们的工作总结其实就是典型的总结类，包括有: 年度总结、月度总结、周报和日报。常见的调查报告类有竞品分析报告和市场调研报告。申请类可以分为申请转正、申请加薪、申请费用等。计划类可以分为工作计划、项目计划、活动计划三个方向。这四个类别，几乎把我们在工作中能够接触到的写作场景，全都 cover 住了。

分好类后，我们来逐个定基调，看看这几个写作场景要怎么写?

2.1 总结类

第一，总结类，总结类的文章基调是: 有深度、有内容、有规划，以年终笔。有些职场人在年终总结的时候潜移默化地写成了流水账。直接把月报汇总，然后阐述分别都做了哪些事，这是一份典型的负面教材。
你的年终总结不但要给你的上级看，而且还要给公司看，平时都做的哪些事。你的领导心里基本都清楚，把这些内容逐个再写一遍既无意义，也无法突出你的能力。
你的领导要看什么呢？第一，看你的成果，第二，看你的分析，第三，看你从过去一年的工作中沉淀的经验，这时候文档重要性不言而喻了，第四，看你对明年的展望，是否干劲十足。
所以在总结的时候，要以结果导向，不要过度关注过程，着重汇报成果。成果最好可以量化，要用数字表达，因为相比于文字，数字展示的更直观。
比如你是Android开发的，你在写的年度总结时候，就可以这样写: 2022 年，在大移动组负责架构优化…</span>

Have you ever been stuck or gone blank trying to solve a problem related to something that you just learned from YouTube or Google tutorials? You seem to understand every line of the code, but without the tutorial, you find yourself in a difficult position. If you have looked at problem-solving in HackerRank or LeetCode, you can relate to how an aspiring programmer feels seeing those challenges for the first time. Everything seems out of the box! Being unable to apply what you learned from a tutorial might make you doubt your knowledge and abilities as you begin to understand the basics of the programming language you&#x27;re learning.

eBooks provide a great way to read books, magazines, and other content on the go. Readers can enjoy eBooks to pass the time during long flights and train rides. The most popular eBook file format is the EPUB file, short for &quot;electronic publication.&quot; EPUB files are supported across a variety of eReaders and are effectively the standard for eBook publication today.
The EPUB file format is an open standard based on XHTML for content and XML for metadata, contained in a zip file archive. And because everything is based on open standards, we can use common tools to create or examine EPUB files. Let&#x27;s explore an EPUB file to learn more about it.

                              <span>作为少数派的老用户和资深潜水员，在各种文章中探索到了新的工具和学到了很多使用小技巧。在过去从学生到金融狗的过程中，笔记管理也逐步完成了从Evernote-&gt;印象笔记(别用!)-&gt;Notion的切换。在少数派上有很多科研大神、学生/老师、Blogger以及其他行业的用户来分享他们在Notion上的用法和经验，但鲜少见到金融行业的分享案例——可能大家都忙着写点评和忙着送外卖了(误)。我就来抛砖引玉分享一点作为一个苦逼消费研究员用Notion来管理行业研究的经验。
背景提醒：用的是自己电脑(Macbook Pro，Mac版本的万得是永远的痛)，没有太多分享的需求，以及作为买方纪要查的不严，有合规风险的请自行判断哈。以下中英文混杂请见谅。
整体架构和思路
起因：其实很久以前在Notion刚出的时候有尝试过以块结构为基础的笔记软件，但当时觉得只是有些新意以及排版会好看一点，但对于自身的Evernote用户来说并没有太大的吸引力。直到回国后，发现Notion已经有了非常能用的Database功能，加上被国内印象笔记折磨了千百次，才动了尝试迁移到Notion的想法。
需求：在入职成为一个消费研究员之后逐步理清了自己在文档管理方面的需求，发现和Notion能提供的其实非常贴合。作为一个金融行业的研究员，每天会主动被动的接受无数的信息和纪要，而传统的文件夹管理、金融行业常用的有道云对于我来说只能起到一个简单的收集作用而无法后期自动化的为我提供收集归纳的帮助。其实，日常消费研究员的工作就是跟踪行业，跟踪不同的标的(股票)，以及相对应的提供点评。作为一个笔记软件，我希望能够做到自动化、结构化的收纳，便携的搜索，方便快捷添加后期点评。
所以从总体的架构上，我做了如下四个维度的Database： Sectors， Sub-Sectors，Equities和Memos。Sector即大行业，比如食品饮…</span>

                              <span>@yxshv came up with LMFAO.tech. But we hadn&#x27;t perfected it yet - it was supposed to just be a feed full of Twitter and Reddit posts. Fetching posts from Twitter and figuring out whether it&#x27;s a memes or not - is difficult, and we knew this from the start. &quot;Isn&#x27;t this a bit dull?&quot; I thought. &quot;We should add liking/retweeting and a points system&quot;. And maybe a leaderboard to spice things up? And that&#x27;s exactly what we did!
We made it so that liking, retweeting and posting also do the same on Twitter.

We still had a huge problem though - the automated feed pulled still wasn&#x27;t perfect - the occasional NSFW content, spam, etc made it almost unusable. So we had to implement a moderation system along with it.

We figured that the best approach would be to make a community page where users can uploa…</span>

据报道，苹果已经在内部测试了苹果地图中的搜索广告，当你搜索餐馆、商店或其他附近的企业时，它可以显示推荐。苹果已经在其应用商店上实施了类似的广告模式，因为开发者可以付费让他们的应用在特定查询的搜索页面上得到推广。苹果的地图，播客和图书等应用目前是无广告的。

电动汽车正在变成订阅制

一家美国加州的初创公司囤积了大量的各种品牌的电动汽车，然后以订阅费的方式提供给客户，除了启动费之外，每月收取 490 至 690 美元，最多可行驶 1000 英里。而另外一方面，宝马公司在英国出售每月 18 美元的座椅加热服务，通用汽车公司则将其安吉星语音服务变成了每辆新的别克、凯迪拉克的 1500 美元的强制订阅。具有讽刺意味的是，即使没有自选附加项目，支撑二手电动汽车价格的主要力量之一是其远程更新的能力，而汽车制造商正在利用同样的技术，通过订阅服务向司机收取费用。


消息来源：BNN



老王点评：如果汽车的主要功能是以软件方式体现的，那么订阅制似乎是有道理的。或许，将来除了汽车，其它的家电、智能房屋都会在一次性购买费用之外，也收取各种功能订阅费用？




2300 万美元：有史以来最大的 YouTube 版税骗局

两位被指控的罪犯成立了一家公司，声称拥有超过 5 万个拉丁音乐歌曲和作品的版权。这家欺诈公司制作了一些假文件，以证明其声称的音乐的所有权。他们通过一家第三方公司合作，该公司可以进入 YouTube 的 CMS 和内容 ID 工具，并帮助艺术家管理他们的数字版权。四年来，这家欺诈公司通过这种手段骗到了 2300 万美元，直到被美国国税局的调查后起诉。

                              <span>Kali Linux 2022.3 在引入了新的 VirtualBox 镜像格式的同时，也使测试变得更加方便。不要忘了试试新的工具！




Kali Linux 在 2022 年的第三次升级中带着激动人心的新内容回来了。

像往常一样，你可以期待新的工具和全面的改进。此外，还有一些关键的亮点，包括新的 测试实验室环境 和 VirtualBox 镜像。

在这里，让我给你介绍一下这个版本的细节。

Kali Linux 2022.3 有什么新内容？

Kali Linux 2022.3 的发布标志着他们开始启用了 新的 Discord 服务器，使社区能够聚集在一起，谈论关于 Kali Linux 的事情。

除了社区有了 Discord 服务器之外，应该引起你对升级的关注的事情包括：


一个便于测试的新测试实验室环境

开放 kali-tools 资源库，以供社区提交

NetHunter 商店中的新软件

一个新的 VirtualBox 镜像格式

大量的新工具


测试实验室环境

Kali Linux 是为安全研究人员量身定做的，可以用于测试和学习。但是，为了增强体验，使任何人都能毫不费力地建立一个测试实验室，Kali Linux 现在增加了易于安装的软件包，如 DVWA 和 Juice Shop。

开发者还提到，在不久的将来会有更多的软件包。

新工具

新的升级包括了五个有趣的工具，它们是：


BruteShark（网络分析工具）

DefectDojo（开源的应用程序漏洞工具）

phpsploit（隐蔽的破解后应用框架）

shellfire（利用命令注入漏洞）

SprayingToolkit（密码攻击）


你可以探索这些工具以了解更多信息。

增强的 VirtualBox 支持

虽然 Kali Linux 已经可以用于 VMware 和 VirtualBox，但现在为 VirtualBox 用户提供了一种新的镜像格式。

你现在可以下载用于 VirtualBox 的 VDI 磁盘镜像和 .vbox 元数据文件。它是原生的 VirtualBox 镜像格式，具有更好的压缩率，下载速度更快。

对于希望使用最新和最先进工具的用户，Kali Linux 提供了按周构建的虚拟机镜像，构建自其滚动分支。

此外，如果你需要构建你的自定义虚拟机镜像，Kali Linux 已经在 GitLab 上提供了一些脚本。

                              <span>通过使用这个简单而强大的 Linux 命令行工具，来安排备份、文件清理以及其他任务。




在计算机上让任务按照有规律并且可预测的时间表运行很重要。作为人类，我们有时会因为分心、脑子里想太多，或是度假而记不住要做的事情。计算机真的很擅长按计划做事，但在计算机采取行动之前，人类必须对计算机进行编程。

在某种程度上，cron 系统是编程的初级简单入门。通过编辑一个文件就可以让计算机做你想让它做的事。你甚至不需要知道文件保存在哪里。只需键入一个简单的命令，输入你希望电脑遵循的 “配方”，并保存。从那时起，计算机会在指定时间执行你的指令，直到被告知停止。

从设计上来看，cron 不是一个复杂的系统。这里有一些你需要了解的内容。

cron 是什么？

cron 命令在 Linux 和 Unix 中无处不在，而且它经常被模仿和重塑，以至于它几乎成了按计划发生的事情的一个通用术语。它是自动化的一种形式，尽管有不同的实现方式（比如 Dillon&#x27;s cron、Vixie&#x27;s cron、chrony 和其他），以及像 anacron 和 systemd 定时器这样的变化，但其语法和工作流程几十年来一直保持着基本一致。

cron 在一个 “假脱机spool” 系统上工作，像打印机和电子邮件一样。如果不你知道打印机和电子邮件使用假脱机也没关系，因为假脱机文件的意义在于，你不需要想太多。在 Linux 系统中，/var/spool 目录被设计为重要但低级的文件的中心枢纽，用户不需要直接与之交互。 在 /var/spool 中管理的一个假脱机是 cron 表（简称为 “crontab”）。 包括你在内的每个用户在 Linux 系统中都有一个 crontab。用户可以编辑、查看和删除自己的 crontab。除此之外，用户可以使用 crontab 来安排任务。cron 系统监控…</span>

I&#x27;m a happy user of the XML-based Docbook markup language. To me, it&#x27;s a precise, explicit, and detailed system that allows me to have contextual and domain-specific metadata in what I write. Best of all, though, it can be transformed (that&#x27;s what XML users call it when XML is converted into another format) into nearly any format, including HTML, EPUB, FO for PDF, plain text, and more. With great power comes a lot of typing, though, and sometimes Docbook feels like it&#x27;s surplus to requirements. Luckily, there&#x27;s AsciiDoc, a system of writing plain text with the same markup-less feel of Markdown, but that transforms to Docbook to take advantage of its precision and flexibility.

Word processing files used to be closed, proprietary formats. In some older word processors, the document file was essentially a memory dump from the word processor. While this made for faster loading of the document into the word processor, it also made the document file format an opaque mess.
Around 2005, the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) group defined an open format for office documents of all types, the Open Document Format for Office Applications (ODF). You may also see ODF referred to as simply &quot;OpenDocument Format&quot; because it is an open standard based on the OpenOffice.org&#x27;s XML file specification. ODF includes several file types,…</span>

                              <span>某日在盗版网站上津津有味的看着《盗墓笔记重启之极海听雷》，翻着翻着，下一章文风突变，变成了《美艳总裁老婆的废柴入赘老公在家族聚会上送礼》的小故事，一时没把持住，看了600多章。我心想我阅读速度也不慢啊，咋感觉剧情进展这么慢，扫了一眼目录当场石化，好家伙，这文你都能水成2200章，真是要顶礼膜拜了。抽了自己几个大嘴巴以后，想了想还是总结一下为啥爽文是如此的让人无法自拔。咱今日不谈网络文学的好坏，就来聊聊这个「爽」。
爽感的对比
首先要自爆家底，这么多年「良好的阅读习惯」让我有幸接触了《斗破苍穹》、《武动乾坤》、《全职法师》、《牧龙师》、《七界传说》、《星辰变》、《盘龙》、《诛仙》、《盗墓笔记》、《鬼吹灯》等，应该也算是见证过当年网文的盛况，自认为对这一类型文有一定的发言权。
传统文学的爽感体验是以一种循序渐进的方式，缓慢而合理的推进剧情，不断累积读者的情绪和体验，最后在结局中以狂风暴雨般的方式宣泄出来。传统题材的小说也不会特意照顾读者感受，不会去刻意迎合读者口味。而网络爽文使用了一种截然不同的方式，彻底以读者为中心进行创作。读者爱看什么，作者就写什么，其目的只有一个：让读者看的爽。至此，网络文学凭借直白的叙事，通俗的文字，连绵不绝的爽快阅读体验，终于成为了文学作品中不可小觑的一种类型。
如果我们以阅读的进度作为x轴，将「爽」值作为Y轴，按照个人体验我画一张如下的图表（黄色为爽文，绿色为传统文学）。

画的比较抽象还望理解，既然要探究为什么爽文的爽会呈现出类似波浪线的形态，令人爽的难以自拔，可能得先从爽文的代入感说起。
爽感的地基：代入感
所谓代入，即读者以移情的方式，将自身转移到主角身上，从而间接获得主角的世界，以及在剧情推进中获得的各类体验。之所以强调代入感，就好比你隔壁是个富二代，你每天看着人家香车美女的生活必然只会觉得不爽，因为你跟他的生活毫无交集，他的爽你根本无法感同…</span>

前言
现在的应用，几乎每一个 App 都存在定位的逻辑，方便更好的推荐产品或服务，获取当前设备的经纬度是必备的功能了。有些 App 还是以LBS（基于位置服务）为基础来实现的，比如美团，饿了吗，不获取到位置都无法使用的。
有些同学觉得不就是获取到经纬度么，Android 自带的就有位置服务 LocationManager ，我们无需引入第三方服务，就可以很方便的实现定位逻辑。
确实 LocationManager 的使用很简单，获取经纬度很方便，我们就无需第三方的服务了吗？ 或者说 LocationManager 有没有坑呢？兼容性问题怎么样？获取不到位置有没有什么兜底策略？
一、LocationManager的使用
由于是Android的系统服务，直接 getSystemService 可以获取到
LocationManager locationManager &#x3D; (LocationManager) context.getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);

一般获取位置有两种方式 NetWork 与 GPS 。我们可以指定方式，也可以让系统自动提供最好的方式。
// 获取所有可用的位置提供器
List providerList &#x3D; locationManager.getProviders(true);
// 可以指定优先GPS，再次网络定位
if (providerList.contains(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER)) {
    provider &#x3D; LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER;

编译常见问题
在开发过程中，有碰到过一些由于编译优化导致的代码修改并不符合我们预期的情况。这也就是之前为什么我经常说编译产物其实是不太可以被信任的。
方法签名变更，底层仓库的方法变更但是上层模块并没有跟随一起重新编译导致的这个问题。
常量优化，将一些常量的调用点直接替换成常量的值。
删除空导包， 没有用的一些导包就会做一次剔除。
最近倒霉了
我们最近碰到一个pipeline相关而且很妖怪的问题。我们一个pipeline会检查apk产物中是否存在异常的方法调用，就是之前介绍的在R8的基础上开发出来的A8。但是最近有一个类被删除了之后呢，但是代码中还有一处调用点。但是这个检测竟然被通过了，然后这部分代码就被合入了master。

这个引用的文件就如上图所示，是一个debug buildType中的，所以并不是所有的apk中都会存在这部分代码。
然后呢，这个MergeRequest就被合入了master分支，因为当天是我们出下一个版本包的时间，然后交付给测试的就是全量编译的debug和release包。别的开发同学rebase完master之后就发现piepline都跑不过了，就导致了他们当天的代码无法被合入。
这个就是事情大概的起因和经过，但是各位有没有想过为什么会发生这个问题吗。这个是不是我们的pipeline出现了bug，导致了这种问题无法被识别出来了呢。
以前有说过，如果简单的说我们的快编系统就是把模块替换成对应的aar，从而达到编译提速。所以因为我们使用的是这个模块对应的aar产物，所以大概率就是因为这个模块的编译产物和源代码有差异导致了这个问题。
其实这个问题一出现我就已经知道大概率是由空导包优化导致的这个问题，因为在pipeline检查的时候，检测的apk产物中确实不存在这个导包。因为我们使用的是一个历史版本的aar，其中无效导包的部分已经被编译器做了删除空导包的优化了。接下来我们看下我写的一个demo中的无效导包。


图一呢是源代码java文件，图二呢则是jar包中的代码。可以简单的看出来行号呢是可以对应的上的，但是这个AppCompatActivity的无效导包在产物中已经被优化掉了。这里也就回答了在编译过程中会保留行号，但是也会优化掉一部分不需要的代码，让我们编译出来的产物更小。
所以也就导致了我们的产物和我们的源代码之间的差异，另外一个角度就是说从apk中我们确实是不存在这个类的导包。但是呢在我们把这部分代码重新编译成aar的时候，就会出现source缺失，导致的语法树无法生成，之后导致的编译失败问题。
这也就是所以我一直和大家说编译产物是不可以被信任的呢。
以前倒霉过
这个是之前的一个故事了，我们之前呢在模块中定义了一些静态常量吧，然后用来标识当前SDK的版本，然后这个值在别的模块中被引用到了。
有一次因为需求变更，我们更改了这个静态变量的值，然后呢我就把这个需求提测了。之后测试反馈给我为什么这边的这个值没有变化啊。

我的天，当时我就是这样，发生了什么情况。然后呢我全量打了个包好了，我当时也就以为只是编译时的一个bug而已。然后后来呢，我查了下资料发现这个就是一个java编译时的常量优化问题。过了一阵子吧，我面试了下字节跳动，然后我和面试官也聊了下这个话题，然后呢在这个方法签名变更的问题上，当时我略输一筹，哈哈哈哈。接下来我们就看下一个demo。


图1呢也是java代码，图2呢则是aar中的编译产物。其中我们可以看到，这个静态常量在编译成产物之后就会被编译成这样。
所以这个就解释了我一开始碰到的这个问题，他就是由于我们的编译器已经把aar中的这部分静态常量编译成了直接的值，然后呢我们的源变化之后如果没有重新编译对应的模块，就会导致这个值一直无法被更新到最新的值。
结论
如果大家对安卓编译相关有兴趣的话，这些问题很可能都会在面试的时候被问到。希望这不仅仅只是一篇我对于这些问题的思考，也能对各位有所帮助吧。</span>

前言
Transform API 是 AGP1.5 就引入的特性，主要用于在 Android 构建过程中，在 Class转Dex的过程中修改 Class 字节码。利用 Transform API，我们可以拿到所有参与构建的 Class 文件，然后可以借助ASM 等字节码编辑工具进行修改，插入自定义逻辑。
国内很多团队都或多或少的用 AGP 的 Transform API 来搞点儿黑科技，比如无痕埋点，耗时统计，方法替换等。但是在AGP7.0中Transform已经被标记为废弃了，并且将在AGP8.0中移除。
而Transrom被废弃之后，它的代替品则是Transform Action，它是由Gradle提供的产物变换API。
Transform API是由AGP提供的，而Transform Action则是由Gradle提供。不光是 AGP 需要 Transform，Java 也需要，所以由 Gradle 来提供统一的 Transform API 也合情合理。
当然如果你只是想利用ASM对字节码插桩，AGP提供了对基于TransformAction的ASM插桩的封装，只需要使用AsmClassVisitorFactory即可，关于具体的使用可见：Transform 被废弃，ASM 如何适配?
而本文主要包括以下内容:
TransformAction是什么?

简单来说，TransformAction就是Gradle提供的产物转换API，可以注册两个属性间的转换Action，将依赖从一个状态切换到另一个状态

在 Dart 中 接口 定义并没有对应的关键字。可能有些人觉得 Dart 中弱化了 接口 的概念，其实不然。我们一般对接口的理解是：接口是更高级别的抽象，接口中的方法都是 抽象方法 ，没有方法体。通过接口的定义，我们可以通过定义接口来声明功能，通过实现接口来确保某类拥有这些功能。
不过你有没有仔细想过，为什么接口会存在，引入接口的概念是为了解决什么问题？可能有人会说，通过接口，可以规范一类事物的功能，可以面向接口进行操作，从而可以更加灵活地进行拓展。其实这只是接口的作用，而且这些功能 抽象类 也可以支持。所以接口一定存在什么特殊的功能，是抽象类无法做到的。
都是抽象方法的抽象类，和接口有什么本质的区别呢？在我的初入编程时，这个问题就伴随着我，但渐渐地，这个问题好像对编程没有什么影响，也就被遗忘了。网上很多文章介绍 抽象类 和 接口 的区别，只是在说些无关痛痒的形式区别，并不能让我觉得接口存在有什么必要性。
思考一件事物存在的本质意义，可以从没有这个事物会产生什么后果来分析。现在想一下，如果没有接口，一切的抽象行为仅靠 抽象类 完成会有什么局限性 或说 弊端。没有接口，就没有  实现 (implements)  的概念，其实这就等价于在问 implements 消失了，对编程有什么影响。没有实现，类之间就只能通过 继承 (extends) 来维护 is-a 的关系。所以就等价于在问 extends 有什么局限性 或说 弊端。答案呼之欲出：多继承的二义性 。
那问题来了，为什么类不能支持 多继承 ，而接口可以支持 多实现 ，继承 和 实现 有什么本质的区别呢？为什么 实现 不会带来 二义性 的问题，这是理解接口存在关键。

根据 TIOBE 指数 8 月份榜单，Python 的“市场份额”在本月又上升了 2%，达到 15.42% 的历史最高水平。自去年 10 月 Python 首次夺得该指数第一的位置以来，已经过去了 10 个月，成为除 Java 和 C 之外唯一保持能第一位置的语言。现在很难找到一个 Python 没有被广泛使用的编程领域。唯一的例外是嵌入式系统，因为 Python 是动态类型的，速度太慢。8 月榜单的前三名是：Python（15.42%）、C（14.59%）、Java（12.40%）。

针对星链终端的攻击已经开始了

自 2018 年以来，星链已经发射了 3000 多颗小卫星进入轨道，还有数千颗卫星计划发射。安全研究人员创建了一个可以连接到星链终端天线上的定制黑客工具，使用的是现成的零件，成本约为 25 美元。它能够暂时短路系统，以帮助绕过星链的安全保护措施，进入星链系统中先前被锁定的部分。虽然星链已经发布了一个更新，以增加攻击的难度，但除非该公司创建一个新版本的主芯片，否则根本问题无法修复。安全研究人员说，所有现有的用户终端都很脆弱。

微软在 2021 年度的漏洞赏金支付上超过了谷歌

从 2021 年 7 月 1 日开始，到 2022 年 6 月 30 日，微软为 335 名研究人员颁发了 1370 万美元的奖励。而谷歌在 2021 年“破纪录”地奖励了 870 万美元。微软今年做了一些改变，为其 Office 365 产品线中出现的高影响漏洞多支付了高达 26,000 美元，其他奖项则增加了 30%。而 另外一方面，谷歌在 Linux 安全方面投入了更多的资金，毕竟现在谷歌几乎所有产品都是基于 Linux 的。

                              <span>写在前面
30 岁，有人开始发现自己不再年轻，有人开始焦虑自己的目标、成功和失败，30 岁在 20 岁看来也许觉得好笑，在 40 岁看来也许又觉得矫情。不管怎么说，我的 30 岁还是来了。
在我派发这篇文章时，已是我在 30 岁路上的第 5 天，此刻才有时间写点东西。

论写生日小作文，我最佩服《失控》的作者凯文凯利（KK）。68 岁生日，他写下 68 Bits of Unsolicited Advice，给出了自己 68 岁时的 68 条忠告。69 岁生日，他写下了 99 Additional Bits of Unsolicited Advice，给出了自己 69 岁的 99 条忠告。今年等来了他 70 岁生日主题文 103 Bits of Advice I Wish I Had Known。嚯，这次直接增加到了 103 条。

崇拜谁就模仿谁，所以很早之前我给自己定下过 30 岁写 30 条感悟的目标。嗯，如你所见，没写出来。还是熊言熊语，随便聊聊。

也许
29 岁最后一天和 30 岁第一天的我们不会有多少质的变化。真正让我们成熟的是那些生活和其中为数不多的经历，或让人恍然大悟，或让人追悔莫及，或让人晕头转向，也可能让人继续前行。
有些人 30 岁的经历你可能在 20 岁已经习得，有些人 30 岁的感受你可能要等到 40 岁才有所体会。
许久没联系的发小前几天微信问我作为三旬老汉有何感受。我这个发小本科毕业 7 年时间里先后换了三份工作，英年早婚，孩子已经能打酱油，如今安家在一个南方城市。我猜他不是真心求教，便说：读书读的太久了，才开始感受社会的暴击。
他回复我：很好，那就不用我了，生活能教你做个人。

29 岁这一年，当我拿到一本建行绿色「个人住房抵押贷款合同」，翻开 X00 万贷款还款 30 年那一页时，脑子里突然冒出了万青的一句歌词：如此生活 30 年，直到大厦…</span>

                              <span>虽然裸辞以后收入不能保证，也中断了自己的职业生涯，但是这一年，从每天晚上规划「明天干吗好呢」开始，我发现自己是可以掌控生活的。
我可以决定自己每一天要不要工作、要不要提升自己、要不要追寻快乐，不管做了什么选择，我都不再抱怨，而且珍惜时间。
比起在公司常常不好意思拒绝他人、被kpi追着跑、看不清大局，我在与自己的相处过程中，似乎渐渐明白「为自己的选择负责」，意味着什么。
不断为时间做决策的过程，也是不断地自我验证。
我更清楚自己擅长、缺失、喜爱、抗拒的事物，根据自己的评估，补上了一些所需技能，也放任自己不勉强接受抗拒的东西，让生活状态尽量保持在「心情不错且有收获」的可持续流动中。
最幸运的是，身边的人不会觉得我很奇怪，写稿技能也在市场上获得回馈。
所以以下是给自己的一年期交代～涵盖这一年的时间安排(多图表预警)、转自由职业体悟、生活创作和心境转变，共4300+字，来不及看先收藏或打赏(喂)也行。
 
一、裸辞后的时间都干吗去了？
在去年6月底离职前，我有4年全职工作经验，媒体编辑，大体是个没什么生活的人。
辞职以后，我大致经历了休养→探索→认命→前进四个阶段：

7-10月 休养期
架了个人网站、从0到1启动单口播客、整理生活(相册/收藏夹等)、看书
裸辞前身体较差，给自己的唯一kpi是「全然地休息」，不着急确定下一步

11月-1月 探索期
随着收入渐少，有去面试，但没有想上班的心情，觉得自己可能要主动做点什么
因此找了喜欢的健身领域，每周工作三天，其他几天继续探索不同可能
顺便回家一趟，经历两岸隔离28+14天

2月-3月 认命期
明晰了自己只是不想浪费时间在反复沟通而非工作本身，因此认命接受自由职业
开始拓展自由职业客户来源，或者说让更多人知道我可以做什么

4月-6月 前进期
封控在家两个月，尝试接触更多客户、完成不同稿子

一个个小问题堆出棘手大问题
同学们好，我是 AZ，AZ 是我。作为一个在「文理学院」上学、学的是两个本身就是跨专业学科的双专业学生，要学的知识范围实在是广到自己都数不明白的程度。从专业本身的基因和数据科学，到分子生物和计算机、有机化学和统计概率、生物工程和数据伦理，再到学院要求的国际关系、文学写作、历史艺术，有至少一半都是超出我已有的知识框架的内容。这些《乱七八糟》的东西一股脑丢过来，基本上摔在地上的和接住且拿住的五五开。为了自己的学业（aka 绩点），也为了自己越来越重的黑眼圈和越来越秃的脑袋，得想想办法。
AZ 的学习工作流 &amp; 关于工作流的思考
工作流，顾名思义，是一套能胜任一系列需求的「数字文具」使用范式。但作为一个被迫要学文科社科工科计算机还有设计的理科生，似乎没有一套这样的范式能很好的适配所有的学科。作为一个很不喜欢和生态逆行的人，我尝试过但无法适应同时使用过多的平台来做信息的储存和处理，因而在很长的一段时间每当我看到新的软件出现下意识的第一反应都是「我在 Notion 里能怎么实现这个功能」。到现在，我绝大部分的信息，不管是生活相关的、学业相关的、还是课外活动相关的，都有条不紊的排列在我的 Notion 里。
但是回到最开始提到的问题上，虽然我很爱 Notion 觉得 Notion 功能非常的强大也把大量的信息托付给这个平台，不得不承认，Notion …</span>

2019 年，导演李一凡拍摄了三年的纪录片在广东时代美术馆上映。随后，这部名为《杀马特我爱你》的片子在网上掀起热烈讨论。豆瓣上有影评这样写道：「还没有一部纪录片可以像《杀马特我爱你》让我这么感动，以致于看到中间，我不自觉地拿起手机拼命的记笔记，生怕遗漏掉其中每一段杀马特充满力量的表达，那些关于自由、关于快乐、关于压迫的生命哲学表达。」这部影片也成为印象中「叛逆的、非主流、亚文化」杀马特群体祛魅的代表作。
与之类似的，由 B 站 UP 主衣戈猜想发布的视频作品《二舅》近期也掀起不小的舆论波澜，从立意到故事本身的真伪都饱受讨论。我们不去剥丝抽茧论证事件本身的真实度，但从画风上来看，它在拍摄手法上也使用了田野民族志的方式。
相比已经成为亚文化符号的「杀马特」，类似「二舅」这样传奇又曲折的人格与经历，不曾像如今这般立于舆论场的镁光灯下。无论看完之后会生出怎样的感受：是疼痛、同情、喟叹或哑然、无感、内心矛盾，这都是一场对乡土生活的祛魅的过程。
它背后的传播母题是怎样的？我们又要如何理解「苦难符号」与情感动员之间的关系？一地鸡毛的舆论场冷却之后，比起片子里讲了什么，还有哪些欲语还休的留白更值得讨论？
我们与故事的距离：「影像真实」争议背后的共性价值
7 月末，《二舅》这个 11 分钟的视频在网络上窜火。不到一个礼拜，公众讨论的话题从文案的精妙、背后的社会议题，再到内容本身的真假。从情怀到打假背后，是不断翻新的衍生讨论，不限于精神内耗、乡土风味、非虚构写作的边界等等。
从传播的角度出发，我们首先需要明确的是：作为观众，我们与作品的距离不等于我们与故事本身的距离。我们首先接触到的层面，始终是「影像真实」。
有网友对此评述：二舅的出现的确改变了我一些看待人性生活的方式。一个治愈当下的故事，如果其内核被抽丝剥茧，被现实解读，那么故事便不再是故…</span>

但是对于大图查看，通常在外界展示的是一张缩略图，点开之后放大就是原图，如果图片很大，OOM发生也是正常的，因此在加载大图的时候，可以看下面这张图

一张图片如果很大，在手机屏幕中并不能完全展示，那么其实就没有必要讲图片完全加载进来，而是可以采用分块加载的方式，只展示显示的那一部分，当图片向上滑动的时候，之前展示的区域内存能够复用，不需要开辟新的内存空间来承接新的模块，从而达到了大图的治理的目的。
1 自定义大图View
像在微信中点击查看大图，查看大图的组件就是一个自定义View，能够支持滑动、拖拽、放大等功能，因此我们也可以自定义一个类似于微信的大图查看器，从中了解图片加载优化的魅力
1.1 准备工作
class BigView : View{

        initBigView(context)
    }
    constructor(context: Context,attributeSet: AttributeSet):super(context,attributeSet){
        initBigView(context)

前言
共享内存（shared memory）是最常见的ipc进程之间通讯的方式之一了，很多linux书籍上，都将共享内存评价为“最有用的ipc机制”，就连Binder机制盛行的android体系，同样也离不开共享内存的应用！在所以ipc方式中，共享内存以“快”赢得了很多开发者的掌声，我们下面深入看看！
共享内存相关函数

首先讲到共享内存，那么肯定离不开要介绍几个函数
shmget
int shmget(key_t key, size_t size, int shmflg);

shmget函数用来获取一个内存区的ipc标识，这个标识在内核中，属于一个身份标识符号（ipc标识符，正常情况下是不会重复的，但是标识符也有限制的，比如linux2.4最大为32768，用完了就会重新计算），通过shmget调用，会返回给我们当前的ipc标识，如果这个共享内存区本来就不存在，就直接创建，否则就把当前标识直接返回给我们！说了一大堆，其实很简单，就相当于给我们返回了一个代表该共享内存的标识罢了！
shmat
void *shmat(int shmid, const void *shmaddr, int shmflg);

shmat把一个共享内存区域添加到进程上，我们之前在mmap这一章节有提到过线性区的概念，就是进程可用的一组地址（可以用，但是用的时候才真正分配），而shmat就把共享内存的这块地址，通过（shmid   shmget可以获取到的）放到了进程中的可用地址范围内，用范围内的合适地址（shmaddr这里指进程想要发生映射的可用地址）指向了共享内存实际的地址，可以见上图！
shmdt
int shmdt(const void *shmaddr);

用于从当前进程把指定的共享内存sh…</span>

实现一个类似天猫sku选择页的滑动效果


实现

基于AppBarLayout+CollapsingToolbarLayout实现

相关基础能力

�CoordinatorLayout�
他是一个高级版的FrameLayout容器，他可以通过Behavior处理内部View之间的嵌套滑动

Behavior
他通过关联联动View和被联动View，在联动View发生滑动时，通知Behavior从而触发被联动View的响应，他主要包含以下几个方法：
onStartNestedScroll：嵌套滑动开始，一般通过parent view的类型确定behavior是否要监听滑动
onNestedPreScroll：嵌套滑动中，要监听的parentView 即将开始滑动，滑动事件还未消费
onNestedScroll：嵌套滑动中，要监听的parentView 即将开始滑动，滑动事件已消费
onStopNestedScroll：嵌套滑动结束

AppBarLayout
AppBarlayout默认实现了AppBarLayout.Behavior，当与其组合的滚动布局（RecycleView、NestedScrollView等）设置了app:layout_behavior&#x3D;&quot;@string/appbar_scrolling_view_behavior&quot;，他就根据设置的滚动标识（app:layout_scrollFlags）响应滚动布局的滚动做出响应。
滚动标识有：
scroll：布局的滚动与滚动事件直接相关。需要设置此标志才能使下面的其他标志生效。
exitUntilCollapsed：当你给布局定义了一个minHeight，此布局将在滚动到达这个最小高度的时候折叠。
enterAlways：任何的向下滚动都会让view出现，这个标识通常用于“快速返回”模式

前言
Java Finalizer 机制提供了一个在对象被回收之前释放占用资源的时机，但是都说 Finalizer 机制是不稳定且危险的，不推荐使用，这是为什么呢？今天我们来深入理解这个问题。
这篇文章是 JVM 系列文章第 6 篇，专栏文章列表：
一、内存管理：
1、内存区域划分
2、垃圾回收机制
3、对象创建过程
4、对象内存布局
5、引用类型
6、Finalizer 机制
二、编译链接过程
1、Java 编译过程
2、Class 文件格式
3、注解处理器
4、注解机制
5、类加载机制
6、泛型机制
三、执行系统
1、方法调用与返回
2、重载与重写
3、反射机制
4、异常机制
提示：很多内容都已经发表过了，最近会整理出来
学习路线图：

1. 认识 Finalizer 机制
1.1 为什么要使用 Finalizer 机制？
Java 的 Finalizer 机制的作用在一定程度上是跟 C/C++ 析构函数类似的机制。当一个对象的生命周期即将终结时，也就是即将被垃圾收集器回收之前，虚拟机就会调用对象的 finalize() 方法，从而提供了一个释放资源的时机。
1.2 Finalizer 存在的问题
虽然 Java Finalizer 机制是起到与 C/C++ 析构函数类似的作用，但两者的定位是有差异的。C/C++ 析构函数是回收对象资源的正常方式，与构造函数是一一对应的，而 Java Finalizer 机制是不稳定且危险的，不…</span>

背景
作为前10的出海项目，公司本地化团队最近要求做产品的国际化适配
我的第一反应是多语言适配，出海的10余款产品中，除了UI样式根据国家审美标准有不同的实现外，就只有多语言了，再多一点的话就是阿拉伯地区的适配他们的文字是从右向左的，习惯也是。

左边是非阿语布局
对于已经做的滚瓜烂熟的操作显然不是他们此次的需求。
一、国际化调研
网上的资料，提到国际化基本都是多语言适配和阿语布局适配，然而国际化适配除了这两项操作外还需要支持CLDR和ICU库，当我查阅官网发现，Android 这边，系统API已经做了两个库的集成操作， 已经利用ICU、CLDR提供Unicode 和其他国际化支持，
比如：
数字分割符，在德语上是&quot;.&quot;分割，中文是&quot;,&quot;

等等很多场景
在Android 这边分为两种情况
1.1 Android 6.0（API 级别 23）及更低版本
1.2 Android 7.0（API 级别 24）及更高版本

本文参与数字文具盒征文活动。

少数派一直是高效率人士最爱的分享平台之一，我也喜欢在工作的闲暇之余学习别人的效率技巧，或者是体验新出的效率 app，也逐渐形成了自己的一套科研工作流。最近浏览少数派中数字文具盒的征文，很多同学的学习方法我都非常认可，并且能够在我的科研生活中找到相似的影子。想来也是该总结总结我三年的经验了，既是反思自己这些年的工作流是否合理，也可借此机会和大家分享讨论何为有效的「学术生活」。
作为一个普通双一流的土博，毕业的主要条件是论文，所以这三年来我的主要工作便是尽可能地多产出成果。但是在此之前，我是没有接受过系统化的科研训练的，并且为了匹配导师团队的研究方向，我几乎是从零开始学习相关知识，笔记的重要性日渐凸显。经过1年多的探索和自我怀疑（以及摸鱼混日子），我终于在博二开始有了一点点产出，在国内的学术会议上口头汇报自己的工作，自此之后，论文对我来说也不再是遥不可及的高峰。当然这离不开导师的悉心指导与团队的帮助，但是我自以为我的工作流帮助并加速了成果产出，不至于即将毕业的我简历还是一片空白。
那么我就从知识的输入、沉淀与输出来谈谈我的学术工作流吧，其中绝大多数方法并不是只有科研工作者才能使用，我相信，只要是喜欢学习的人，整理知识的目的一定是殊途同归的。希望接下来的内容能够给大家带来一点点启发。
知识的输入
之前说到，我在博一期间研究的内容几乎都是首次接触，所以大量的基础知识学习便是期间最主要的工作。感谢当今学术圈乐于分享和讨论的氛围，我所在领域——复杂网络研究——各方面工作都有前人完整的论述与著作（对复杂网络感兴趣…</span>

Documentation is an important part of any technical project. Good documentation tells the end user how to run the program, how to use it, or how to compile it. For many projects, plain text documentation is the standard. After all, every system can display plain text files.
However, plain text is limiting. Plain text files lack formatting elements like italics text, bold text, and titles. To add these elements, we can leverage HTML. HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the markup language used in all web browsers. And with a little extra effort, you can use HTML to write project documentation that can be read by everyone.
HTML uses a series of tags enclosed in angle brackets …</span>

I am teaching Python using Raspberry Pi 400 computers in a local library for the second year in a row. A couple of this year&#x27;s students have not experienced success with mathematics in their school. One asked me if she needed algebra to attend our class. I told her I had failed algebra, geometry, and trigonometry in school. She was relieved. Another student rushed in the door a bit late because she was taking geometry in summer school after failing to pass the course during the school year. I shared my own story of learned helplessness and my distress at the thought of math tests. My own bad experiences impacted my high school and early colleg…</span>

🔥 Hi，我是小彭。本文已收录到 GitHub · AndroidFamily 中。这里有 Android 进阶成长知识体系，有志同道合的朋友，关注公众号 [彭旭锐] 带你建立核心竞争力。
前言
Java Reference 类型是与虚拟机垃圾回收机制密切相关的知识点，同时也是面试重要考点之一。 一般认为 Java 有四种 Reference（强引用 &amp; 软引用 &amp; 弱引用 &amp; 虚引用），但是其实还有隐藏的第五种 Reference，你知道是什么吗？
在这篇文章里，我将总结引用类型的用法 &amp; 区别，并基于 ART 虚拟机分析相关源码。如果能帮上忙，请务必点赞加关注，这真的对我非常重要。
提示： 本文源码分析基于 Android 9.0 ART 虚拟机。
这篇文章是 JVM 系列文章第 5 篇，专栏文章列表：
一、内存管理：
1、内存区域划分
2、垃圾回收机制
3、对象创建过程
4、对象内存布局
5、引用类型
6、Finalizer 机制
二、编译链接过程
1、Java 编译过程
2、Class 文件格式
3、注解处理器
4、注解机制
5、类加载机制
6、泛型机制
三、执行系统
1、方法调用与返回
2、重载与重写
3、反射机制
4、异常机制
提示：很多内容都已经发表过了，最近会整理出来
学习路线图：

1. 认识 Java 引用
1.1 Java 四大引用类型
Java 引用是 Java 虚拟机为了实现更加灵活的对象生命周期管理而设计的对象包装类，一共有四种引用类型，分别是强引用、软引用、弱引用和虚引用。我将它们的区别概括为 3 个维度：
维度 1 - 对象可达性状态的区别： 强引用指向的对象是强可达的，而其他引用指向的…</span>

很高兴遇见你~
在本系列的上一篇文章中，我们介绍了 Flutter 开发环境搭建，以及使用 AndroidStudio 运行你的第一个 Flutter 项目，体验了热重载。还没有看过上一篇文章的朋友，建议先去阅读Flutter 系列（一）：运行你的第一个 Flutter 应用，在我看来，Dart 在设计时应该是借鉴了百家语言之所长😄：Java，Kotlin等：
1、在静态语法方面，如：类型定义，方法声明，泛型等，和 Java 非常相似
2、一些语法特性，如：函数式特性，空安全，函数默认值等，和 Kotlin 非常相似
3、Dart 还有一些自己独创的语法，如：命名构造方法，级联操作符等
总之，熟悉之后，你会发现 Dart 是一门非常有意思的编程语言，接下来就让我们一起进入 Dart 的语法学习吧
注意： Dart 语法和 Java，Kotlin 真的很像，尤其是 Java。另外如果对 Kotlin 语法不熟的，可以去看我的另外一篇文章：&quot;Kotlin&quot;系列: 一、Kotlin入门
一、变量和方法
1.1、变量
1）、Dart 可以显示指明类型来声明一个可变的变量。且指明的类型分为可空和非空
2）、Dart 也可以使用 var 关键字来声明一个可变的变量，此时编译器会根据变量初始值自动推断类型
3）、Dart 使用 final 关键字来声明一个不可变的变量，且可以替代 var 或加在类型前面
4）、Dart 中变量如果是非空类型，那么必须给一个默认值，否则无法编译通过。如果是可空类型，默认值都为 null
5）、Dart 中每一行代码都要加 ; 😂，走回头路了，有点鸡肋

本篇我们继续介绍 Flutter 绘图的 Path 的应用。Flutter 的 Path 类提供了一个三维空间的变换方法，可以实现路径在三维空间的平移、旋转等操作，从而可以实现3D 绘制的效果。通过本篇你将了解到：
Path的三维转换方法 transform 的使用。
绕三维空间某一点的旋转实现。
卡片3D 旋转动效。
类似日历的三维翻页效果。
Path 的 transform 方法
Path 类的 transform 方法 将给定的Path 通过一个Float64List的对象进行三维变换，然后返回变换后的 Path对象，方法定义如下。
Path transform(Float64List matrix4) {
  assert(_matrix4IsValid(matrix4));
  final Path path &#x3D; Path._();
  _transform(path, matrix4);
  return path;
}

其中 Float64List 一般都是通过 Matrix4 对象的 storage得到，例如我们在 x 方向平移5.0，可以按如下方式得到对应的 Float64List 对象。
var transform &#x3D; (Matrix4.identity()
  ..translate(5.0, 0.0, 0.0)).storage;

Matrix4提供了平移、旋转、逆矩阵等多种方法，有兴趣的可以看一下 Matrix4的源码，实际上就是大学线性代数课（这门课还挺难的😂）的矩阵乘法内容。
绕任意点旋转
网上关于绕任意点的旋转推导很多，这里就不再赘述，结论就是实际上三个矩阵，…</span>

0x1、引言
如题，最近两周疲于折腾公司第三方SDK升级，掉坑里一直出不来，前天突发奇想，终于定位到问题原因。

问题很简单，却花费了这么长时间，终究还是我太菜了！

BUG虽然解了，但觉得还是有必要 记录复盘下，以便下次遇到类似问题时，能找到更好的切入点，更快地把问题解决。
问题概述
现在哪个房产类APP不上VR全景图啊，所以我司也整了一个，经纪人录盘时，使用全景相机对盘源进行拍摄，在录盘填信息的同时，把全景图也上传到服务器。而他们录盘的过程是这样的：
使用 全景相机官方APP，连接相机，对盘源进行拍摄，官方APP拼接生成全景图；
拍完打开 公司APP，来到录盘页，填写录盘信息，然后打开手机相册，选择对应的全景图上传；
录一次盘得在两个APP间来回切换，可以是可以，但流程繁琐，效率也低，他们更希望：
直接就在公司APP上就可以完成相机连接、拍摄、拼接和上传。
任务传到客户端这边，所以我们需要：
集成官方SDK，参考官方Demo和文档，根据具体业务进行二次开发。
杰哥徒手封装的Library已经稳定跑了两年：

本以为可以一劳永逸，安享晚年，最近却出了幺蛾子：

有经纪人买了新款相机，然后用公司APP无法拍照。

em...硬件、固件升级，需要更新下SDK，可以理解，那就升吧，正当我以为这次升级，会像当初刚集成时那样 丝滑流畅，却是 磨人踩坑 的开始...

0x2、第一道坎：SDK自带预览组件黑屏
很快新的SDK到位，Library替换上新AAR，API有些变动，跟着Demo改改，算是跑起来了，但问题也来了：
拍摄预览页 → 关闭并跳转新页面 → 再次打开预览页 → 预览组件黑屏
看了下官方Dem…</span>

前言
HashMap 这个词想必大家都挺熟悉的！但往往大多数都知其所用，而不知其原理，导致面试的处处碰壁！因此，这一篇的作用就是以面试的角度剖析HashMap！话不多说，直接开始！
温馨提示：此文有点长，建议先插眼，等有空闲时间观看
1、为什么要学HashMap?
刚刚说了本篇是以面试角度剖析HashMap，那么面试常见的问题有哪些呢？
HashMap的原理？内部数据结构？
HashMap中put方法的过程是怎样实现的？
HashMap中hash函数是怎样实现的？
HashMap是怎样扩容的呢？
HashMap中某个Entry链太长，查找时间复杂度可能达到O(n)，怎么优化？
2、剖析HashMap
2.1 HashMap初始化
虽然这一步大家很熟悉，但过程还是少补了！
HashMap hashMap &#x3D; new HashMap(6, 1);
HashMap hashMap2 &#x3D; new HashMap();

源码解析
这个就很简单了，初始化HashMap有两个构造器，一个无参，一个有参。（泛型就不说了吧）
那就从简先看无参的！

/**
 * The default initial capacity - MUST be a power of two.
 */
static final int DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY &#x3D; 1 &lt;&lt; 4; // aka 16

/**
 * The load factor used when none specified in constructor.
 */
static final float DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR &#x3D; 0.75f;

public HashMap() {

本文参与数字文具盒征文活动。

因为去年写了这篇文章分享我的 workflow，所以在这次的征文题目公布时，少数派的编辑也贴心的来问我有没有想分享的工具。说实话，对于这次的征文题目，我是喜忧参半：喜的是可以期待一波好工具的分享，满足我对工具的探索欲； 忧的是对工具探索的过度好奇往往会占用额外的时间和精力，反而加剧了我的论文写作拖延症。 相信很多少数派的读者和我一样，对于新的工具总是充满好奇，迫不及待地探索一番后，又很快搁置到一边， 真正能用下去的工具往往还是那几个常用的。
我想，造成此类现象的原因可能有以下几个：

一些工具虽然有全新的名字和界面，但是功能往往与已有的工具重合，并不能给工作效率带来实质帮助；
对于一些工具类软件而言，开发新的功能毕竟困难，于是转而希望努力改变或者教导用户一套新的方法论或使用逻辑。然而，愿景虽好，但这往往并没有从用户的实际需要出发，反而带来了过高的学习成本；
工具自身的缺陷问题：譬如平台覆盖不足，导入导出不够开放，系统不够稳定，字体不够大，等等；
工具本身提供了简单且实用的功能，但是介绍中并没有提供实际的应用场景，所以有时不知如何将之纳入自己的工作流中进行合理使用；
个人主观的好恶。

当然，作为一个不懂任何工具开发的文科菜鸟，我自然也没有资格吹毛求疵，对工具大加评判。在本文中，我只想从一个长期用户的实际使用体验出发，分享一些我实际研究学习过程中真正用到的一些工具，希望为你带来一点点参考。
另外，我每天用到的学术工具首先包括 DEVONthink、Obisidian、Zotero 和 Scrivene…</span>

                              <span>前言
我是阿杜，目前在开发一款笔记类应用 岁月笔记 。2020 年苹果推出过一个「轻 App (App Clips)」功能，让我们不需要下载安装 也能使用，号称苹果版小程序；
但是时至今日一直被当做APP的阉割版，作为苹果公司推出的系统级小程序,或许有更酷的交互方式；
正好做的APP内有个信件模块，用户写好信件后分享生成图片，这样交互太呆板了，不太友好；可以利用AppClip，把信件写入NFC卡片，让手机靠近NFC，弹出信件卡片！
效果如下👇🏻

原理
其实原理也很简单，就是把信件编辑好写入NFC，然后卡片调起信件；

NFC只要是苹果支持的DNEF数据格式的白卡都可以,某多多上有卖的；
刚开始是这样的
白卡
然后设计图案后，交由厂家打印成卡贴后贴在 NFC 卡片上。

外观
只有一个卡片也不太拿得出手，所以给它设计了一个盒子
外包装

                              <span>万万没想到，时隔多年我又开始用上了QQ。
起因是需要打包一些软件给朋友，发微信超过了200M限制，好不容易传上了网盘，朋友那边的下载速度却只有几十k。我实在没辙了，朋友突然提议说——为何不在QQ传给他？
QQ？
我已经卸载好多年了。这个一路承载了我青春回忆的应用，却在我年龄渐长后变成了不堪回首的过往，转而封锁空间、卸载停用。
只能偶尔在媒体上了解到其主力军已经变成了00后，且功能越来越花里胡哨。最新版本更是因为搭配虚幻4引擎、大小达到800M，而被戏称为腾讯3A大作。
朋友这次提起，我才知道原来QQ传送文件竟没有大小限制，速度也很快，连钉钉都有限制大小，QQ竟这么勇的吗？好奇心驱使我去下载了最新的8.9.3版本来体验，意外发现如今的QQ还真有许多妙用，当然槽点也不少，且听我细细道来。

聊天斗图很过瘾
在微信斗图时是不是常苦恼表情包不够？在QQ这里完全没这种烦恼！
在聊天输入框搜索，就会弹出表情，不用像微信一样单独去搜，搜图贼快！

如果你连表情都懒得搜，QQ还能智能帮你斗图！这在QQ叫“怼图”，即聊天中如果 20 秒内连续出现三次图片即可触发怼图标记，点击一下标记，系统就会根据对方发的表情自动帮你斗图，简直不要太爽。

如果这还不够过瘾，QQ还有招！
长按常规表情包，可以触发弹射功能，届时就能看到满屏幕的表情乱飞，看着就很解压。

可能是觉得表情包停留在视觉动效，还不足以抚平年轻人躁动的心，所以QQ还增加了触感的刺激。选择“戳一戳”好友，不同的动作会让手机产生不同节奏的震动，交互很爽。

如果觉得公共表情不够独特，你也可以自己捏脸换装，生成专属形象的表情包，也十分地酷。

表情方面很多玩法，语音上也放开了限制。
微信语音上限为60秒，而QQ语音可达到120秒，与之配套的还有语音进度条，想拖到哪都行，也支持变音。
 （感激微信最多支持60秒语音，不然对于经常收到长辈关爱语音…</span>

本文又名：Android Studio插件开发（二）：Editors编辑篇
之前的阅读量太低了，换个名字看看会不会高点，o(╥﹏╥)o
概述
作为连Setter和Getter都要生成的程序猿来说，时不时还要手写重复的代码简直不能忍。而本篇文章，讲的就是如何开发一个简单的自动生成插件，来帮你完成一键生成重复代码。
最终要实现的效果有：
智能识别  只有在需要满足条件且需要生成的地方，才会提供生成功能
自动生成  选择文本，根据关键词，生成特定的代码
创建插件
上一篇文章有讲过，首先要创建一个AutoEditorAction，然后在plugin.xml中注册
class AutoEditorAction: AnAction() {
    override fun actionPerformed(event: AnActionEvent) {

    }
}


    //添加在编辑弹框的第一位
    


定义菜单操作的可见性
应该有注意过，Android Studio里菜单栏下面的功能，并非一直可以点击，有时候是置灰状态，有时候甚至没有显示出来。这些都是通过AnAction里的update方法来控制的。

前言
在实际项目开发中会频繁的用到线程，线程使用起来是很简单，但是滥用线程会带来性能问题， 比如启动一个线程至少 占用16kb的内存、线程过多会导致cpu的频繁切换而cpu切换成本是很高的、消耗大量用户电量等问题， 所以应该让app的线程数保持在合理水平，这是性能优化中很重要的一部分。本文对线程优化方面的知识做了一个全面总结，主要内容如下：

一、线程调度原理解析
线程调度的原理
在任意时刻，CPU 只能执行一条机器指令，每个线程只有获得了 CPU 的使用权之后才能执行指令，也就是说 在任意时刻，只有一个线程占用 CPU，处于运行状态。而我们平常所说的 多线程并发运行，实际上说的是多个线程轮流获取 CPU 的使用权，然后分别执行各自的任务。其实在可运行池当中有多个处于就绪状态的线程在等待 CPU，而 JVM 负责线程调度，按照特定机制为多个线程分配 CPU 使用权。
上面的描述提到了三个主要信息：
在任意时刻，只有一个线程占用 CPU，处于运行状态
多线程并发运行，实际上说的是多个线程轮流获取 CPU 的使用权
JVM 负责线程调度，按照特定机制为多个线程分配 CPU 使用权
线程调度模型
线程调度模型可以分为两类，分别是 分时调度模型 和 抢占式调度模型。
分时调度模型：让所有线程轮流获取 CPU 的使用权，而且均分每个线程占用 CPU 的时间片，这种方式非常公平
抢占式调度模型：JVM 使用的是抢占式调度模型，让优先级高的线程优先获取到 CPU 的使用权，如果在可运行池当中的线程优先级都一样，那就随机选取一个
Android 的线程调度
Android 的线程调度从两个因素决定，一个是 nic…</span>

                              <span>之前我分享过2T容量的M.2 SSD固态硬盘，其标称速度达到了7400MB/s。由于其发烧级别的价格，让许多小伙伴都无法接受。其实当时我也在想，难道就不能降一个规格吗？比如用5000MB/s的SSD固盘，难道PS5主机会真的无法识别？还是说速度上会有较大的影响呢。
这次我从朋友那入了一条大华的C970 SSD固态硬盘，本来是装机用的，现在先拿来测试一下在PS5主机内的情况，希望能解开各位小伙伴的疑问。

关于主机的空间拓展

PS5主机内部大概是825GB的存储空间，实际可用约为677.2GB容量。以现今PS5游戏的容量来说，随便安装10个游戏都满了，特别是开了第二档会员后。幸好PS5提供了内置M.2 SSD扩充槽，可以增加主机的存储容量。

对于M.2 SSD的规格是否有要求？

翻阅官方说明可以看到，PS5的内置M.2 SSD的规格需要M插槽类型，长度支持2230、2242、2260、2280、22110，单面或者双面M.2 SSD均可，存储大小在250GB至4TB，建议连续读取速度达5500MB/s或更高。换句话说，就是推荐采用PCIe Gen4.0x4传输模式，速度能达到5500MB/s以上，容量4TB以下的SSD固态硬盘 。

出于对热散的需求，PlayStation 5也支持带有M.2 SSD散热“马甲”的固态硬盘安装，只不过整体厚度不能超过11.25mm。

那么是不是速度达到5500MB/s以上的M2.SSD就可以了呢？在此官方特意作出了说明。“不能保证所有符合所述规格的 M.2 SSD设备都能与您的主机配合使用，并且不对第三方产品的选择、性能或使用承担任何责任。”因此建议在选购前，先关注各个厂家的官方介绍，或者看一下用户实际体验，是否支持PS5主机。

最近我写东西时遇到了一些阻碍。这些问题可能你也遇到过。

想写的内容已经有人写过了，没有写的动力了，怎么办？
总觉得自己的想法和经历不值得分享出来，去浪费别人的时间。
花了时间和精力写出来了，但阅读量和反馈都很一般，信心因此被打击。

总结下来就是，我想写的，别人已经写过了；我不想写的，写着也没意思；想写的，写不清楚，别人看不懂。完了，不想写作了。
这些问题都会有一个共性矛盾，就是我带入了「别人」这个角色。「别人」已经看过的，「别人」可能不喜欢，担心浪费「别人」的时间。我们去担心「别人」，然后把不想写作的问题归咎在对自己的不自信。
但这只是一种托辞。
其实，我们创作欲的敌人不是「不自信」，而是对「面向自己写作」与「面向读者写作」这两个概念的混淆——该面向自己写的时候，念着别人；该面向别人去写的时候，觉得应该坚持自己。

面向自己写作：为了自己的求知欲、表达欲而写；
面向读者写作：为了解决读者的需求，写读者关心的内容。

是为自己写，还是为读者写？之前的我总是在这天平的两端来回摇摆。
一、我的写作经历
1.1 面向读者写作
最早启发我「写作方法」的是罗辑思维和得到，他们以「通过知识服务，为用户节约时间」的理念打磨内容，当时作为用户，我觉得这样的内容特别受用。而这种以服务的姿态来交付内容的理念，一直影响着我的写作。当时的我，觉得做内容其实就是把别人的知识，用清晰的结构（故事引入-结论先行-展开论证-结尾升华）加上简单易懂的大白话来呈现给读者就行。
我也用类似的思路对接老板的朋友打磨短内容，制作课程，写知识干货的文章，组建内容小组…</span>

 不断扩张的品牌播客队伍   

创立播客的国内品牌主要由两部分组成：一部分是新消费品牌，一部分是各行各业的头部企业。拥有较为充足的市场预算，对于传播媒介非常敏感，拥有持续内容创作的资源，最重要的是都有建立品牌形象的需求。

在广告预算大幅缩减的环境下，许多大公司都在今年陆续进场，比如特斯拉、仲量联行、摩登天空等，都在近期开设了品牌播客。一些早期入局的品牌还在持续投入，Withinlink碚曦投资协作体出品的「贝望录」、GGV纪源资本的「创业内幕」都已规律更新超过三年。
部分2022年开播的品牌播客
经过对于近三年品牌播客的梳理，不难发现创立播客的国内品牌主要由两部分组成：一部分是新消费品牌，一部分是各行各业的头部企业。拥有较为充足的市场预算，对于传播媒介非常敏感，拥有持续内容创作的资源，最重要的是都有建立品牌形象的需求。
品牌播客成为近期的内容趋势，有三个很重要的原因：
播客市场认知不断提升，走出隐秘的角落。这点从微信指数上不难看出，去年7月31日指数为41万，今年同比翻了一倍，今年7月6日甚至猛增到了1222万。这背后可能是TME、Spotify在播客领域的持续布局，越来越多的名人大咖入场，但无论原因是什么，播客都在走进越来越多人的视野，成为不能忽视的媒介。
品牌播客也有盈利空间，并非纯投入。品牌播客也可以为其他品牌打广告，乍一听并不是件可行的事，但实际已经在发生。因为想要让受众听完一期节目，首先不能一听就是广告宣传，这样很容易劝退，内容必须足…</span>

                              <span>使用 DialogX 快速构建 Android App 对话框
传统原生对话框组件存在着内存泄漏、自定义程度不足的问题，开发时常会因为遇到各式各样的奇葩崩溃而烦恼，面对着产品和设计师诸如“对话框圆角大一些”、“能不能照着iOS设计稿的模糊效果做”、“下滑列表界面自动关掉对话框”等等诸多需求又难以解决，又不想每次封装或编写一大堆的代码去实现某一个小小的提示框需求，你可以试试 DialogX，它足以满足大部分场景下快速完成对话框、阻断提示框、非阻断提示框、底部对话框等等各式各样的对话框组件，又能完美满足各种主题和功能扩展需求，极大地方便了开发流程，帮助你快速构建应用对话框功能。
DialogX 的 Github 地址：https://github.com/kongzue/DialogX
易用性对比
对比传统 AlertDialog，DialogX 具有很大的优势：
DialogX 采用全新的实现方式，默认 View 实现方式更为轻便，亦可选 Window、DialogFragment 实现方式，自由灵活。
DialogX 的启动与线程无关，你可以在任意线程启动 DialogX 而它都将自动在 UI 线程运行。
DialogX 的启动无需 context 参数，默认提供静态方法一句代码实现对话框的启动，使用更加方便。
更自由，开发者可以轻松定制对话框中任何组件的样式，包括文本样式、按钮文字样式、菜单文本样式、输入文本样式，大到标题，小到提示消息都可以根据需要随意修改。
DialogX 采用主题分离设计，默认自带 Material 主题，可选引入 IOS、Kongzue、MIUI 等其他风格主题，大大减小 App 体积，同时提供了主题接口，如有定制需求完全可以自行实现一套私有主题。
更低的耦合度，更少的问题，DialogX 可以在对话框正在运行的过程中随意关闭 Activity ，…</span>

缘起：从初尝到热爱，聊聊我为何享受这项运动？
我最开始接触到定向运动（orienteering）是在大学本科期间， 当时在选课系统查找体育课时，发现一门之前没有听过的课程，叫做「定向运动」，出于好奇我便选了这门课。 可能是我平时上课比较认真，加之期末考试时取得了不错的成绩，课程老师邀请我加入学校的定向运动队（我才知道学校还有专门的校队）。
因为定向运动多为户外举行，在训练的时候，我们常集体去到曾举行过定向赛事的山林、公园等，使用地图和指北针进行实地定向，我也因此得以打卡了广东不少胜地，例如深井古村、小洲村、黄山鲁、大夫山、赤水村等等。

对这项运动接触越久，我越喜欢这项运动。虽然它对脑力和体力的要求都较高，且因为经常翻山越岭而面临着受伤的风险，但也正是因为它的刺激和富有挑战性，才令我享受其中。 至于我为什么喜欢它，主要是有以下两点：
同时挑战脑力与体力：有人曾把定向运动生动地比喻成「寻宝游戏」，因为这项运动不仅仅是要依靠体力，也很考验脑力。 我们需要在有限的时间内，通过地图和指北针迅速定位到点标的位置，并快速移动完成「打点」，这就要求我们需要具备良好的识图和定位能力。刚开始训练的时候，我时常会迷路， 哪怕手里拿着地图和指北针，跑着跑着就不知道自己身处位置了。

翻山越岭：对于很喜欢户外运动的我来说， 定向运动为我提供了深入不同场景的机会，像我以往参加的赛事中，有些是在山里面举行，有些是在街道众多的小镇里面举行。场景不同，体验也富有差异。相比于其他有固定场景的运动，定向运动更符合我的喜好（虽然它也因为需要前往不同场景，而没那么便利）…</span>

                              <span>2020年的两个小故事
少数派对于我的”播客创作“而言，有很特殊的意义。2020年我为了完成自己的本科毕业论文《场景时代播客特点的新思考——播客伴随性与情感性的相关性研究》，给很多关注播客的少数派网友发了私信，请求大家帮忙填填问卷，获得了大家的热情支持和鼓励，在这里先向所有帮助过我的少数派朋友们表示感谢！！！
除此之外，2020年对于我也有非常重要的影响。我在钟南山院士宣布”人传人“的当天离开北京回到了老家，准备过年，作为一个2020年的应届毕业生，我当时还在思考如何在春招中找到一份更加令人满意的工作，以及期待夏天的毕业典礼。后来的事情大家都知道，之后我再也没能以一个在校生的身份回到我的母校中国传媒大学。
2022年，我做了一档播客
6月30日，我的播客第一期正式上线，记录了我的好朋友在疫情之中裸辞，历经三个月四处求职的故事。这档播客的名字叫做《离开定福庄以后》，是一档以中国传媒大学毕业生为线索，记录当下青年生活经历的人物叙事类播客。开启这样一档播客有很多方面的考虑，比如可操作性强，选题丰富，没有同类型内容等等，但是最重要的一点是，我和很多朋友见过的最后一面都是在疫情之前，我们从大学进入社会的正常过程似乎被完全打断了，一转眼又是两年过去，我觉得记录下不同的人在毕业后的生活经历，是非常有价值，也是非常有群体代表性的。
我的播客封面
目前为止，我已经发布了总共六期播客，在国内各大音频平台同步更新。最近，《离开定福庄以后》在网易云音乐和小宇宙上的订阅收藏量刚刚破百，可以说是一档名副其实的小播客。一开始，我也幻想过会不会做出一期节目然后直接爆火，但自己当然也明白不太可能，做出来六期节目以后，我觉得自己心里很清楚的一点是，做播客，应该是一件细水长流的事情。对于一个从零开始、单打独斗的素人而言，能够收获大量听众的肯定只是极少数，而如果把播客当作一件需要慢慢耕耘的事情来做，做好自己喜欢的…</span>

                              <span>iOS 平台可以自定义小部件的 app 有很多，有那么几种是和代码相关的，例如 JSBox、Taio 和本文的这款 Scriptable。不用码的小部件，可以根据 app 提供的方式进行自定义，而用码的小部件，则可以完全根据自己的需求来写规则，并且可以组合不同类型的信息。有码就有了更强大的自定义属性，但同时又一定程度上提高了门槛。这时候就会出现很多已经写好的示例提供给使用者，不想研究的人开箱即用，懂码的人也可以根据需求自己改改。
虽然 Scriptable有官方推荐的小部件库，但是有一些小部件是无法做到开箱即用的，例如本文要讲的这一款 iTermWidget。这是一款长的像 iTerm 的 Widget。iTerm 是一款  macOS 平台的命令行工具。命令行就是用纯文字敲出来和展示出来的东西，而 iTerm 通过区分不同代码的颜色来让信息更加易读，这样的展示方式成为了一种特色，才出现了现在这个小部件。
想要一个这样的小组件，是因为其他 App 自带的小部件所能展示信息的方式比较有限，通常我只能选择开发者做好的样子。而这款 iTermWidget 最大的特点就是字小，意味着展示的信息够多。其次它没有过多复杂的展现方式，仅仅是依靠文字和换行颜色，从信息的传达上不够直观但足够简洁。可以拥有展示多达 6 行信息的小部件（并且还可以进一步自定义），是我一直想要的。
正常情况下，在软件自带的 Gallery 里面「GET」到这个小组件后直接运行，是没有办法成功的。我在前两次下载这个 Scriptable 的时候就败在了这一步，当时就删掉了。这款软件内的小部件都是用 JavaScript 来写的，没有代码基础的人就完全无从下手。而刚好最近我在学 JavaScript，心想也许能解决之前没有搞懂的问题，想再尝试一下。但不用担心，下面的内容不涉及到 JavaScript 的具体语法等内容…</span>

                              <span>趁着2019级非全日制统招研究生迎来毕业季，2023年考研院校发布招生简章的前夕，我想以一个当事人的身份来谈谈这个被称之为「水硕」的非全日制硕士研究生，聊一聊它的前世今生，探讨一下它的是非曲直，为后来者提供一份有价值的参考。
真的假文凭

“我初中毕业都能拿下党校学历，你说好拿不好拿?其实就是花钱买文凭。我还去上课，一个月上几天吧，就在县党校，很多领导课都不上。考试时答案都有小抄，可以买，考试时监考也不严， 可以抄。就是英语对我有点难，答案我事先都在书上找好了，考试时抄上就行了，这样英语也过了。 今年春上领的毕业证，函授本科。”

这是一段对某位干部的访谈记录，截取自一篇在体制内广为流传的博士论文《中县干部1》。2009年的中县干部群体，拥有本科研究生学历堪称「标配」。被戏称为「文凭批发基地」的党校、当地院校功不可没。在党政系统内，这类注水文凭是被承认的。客观的讲，学历只是门槛，但对于拥有正规国民教育序列学历的干部来说，似乎有些不公。
如果文凭代表的是对教育质量的衡量，那么忽略了教育质量的文凭，充其量也就是「真的假文凭」。在职学历的的含金量问题一直被社会所诟病，从生源的筛选，到培养过程，整个链条弥漫着不靠谱的味道。作为在职学历中顶级代表---在职硕士研究生也是如此，不免令人扼腕叹息。有识之士已经看出，现有的在职学历教育面对其所肩负的国民教育责任日渐力不从心。
随着国家日渐强盛，也出于从构建终身学习社会的目的，国家对非全日制学历下手改革是必然的趋势。剩下的问题就是什么时候改？从哪里下手改？怎么改？终于，2016年，教育部一纸通知2，正式将硕士研究生按照学习方式分为全日制硕士研究生与非全日制硕士研究生，并规定两者均采用全国硕士研究生统考的招生模式，执行相同的培养政策和标准，学历学位证书具有同等的法律地位和相同效力。在职研究生新政策前后区别见下表：

⚠️ 修改注册表前记录备份原始值，如果出问题还能恢复！修改注册表务必谨慎！修改注册表务必谨慎！修改注册表务必谨慎！重要的话说三遍！
如果出现 Windows Xbox Game Bar 录制的视频在 Apple 设备上播放出现绿边或花屏的情况，可以尝试。

Win + R 输入 regedit，打开注册表编辑器；
左边目录依次定位到 HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\GameDVR，打开后看右边；
VideoEncodingResolutionMode 双击打开，将值改为 0；
CustomVideoEncodingHeight 改为 1080（十进制）；
CustomVideoEncodingWidth 改为 1920（十进制）；
保存重启计算机，搞定。

                              <span>本文参与数字文具盒征文活动。

我是一名大二在读的本科生，经过大学一年的摸索，自认为对知识管理方面有一定的心得，想和各位分享一下。首先讲一下我的使用知识管理软件的理念：

不盲目追求all in one，专业的事要交给专业软件去做。
好的软件应该有助于思维方式的培养，而不是束缚自己的思考。

我将这个系统分为输入-暂存-整理-输出四部分，涵盖了知识的获取到内化的全流程，每个流程我基本都使用了不同的工具，思维导图如下。

 
一、知识输入
在信息爆炸的互联网时代，我们最不缺的就是信息，如何寻找到有用的信息便成为了关键，下面先罗列几个我平常获取知识的方式
实体书籍
我曾在网课期间有一段时间强迫自己进行完全电子化的学习，但我始终无法适应，来来回回看各种教程，折腾各类笔记软件也费时费力，于是我还是买来了纸质的课本和笔记本。对于我来说，实体书籍在我的学习中仍然占有很大一部分，简单快捷的体验可以让我更加专注于书中的内容。看到想要摘录的内容时我会手打到Flomo中，进行一个初步的提炼，也可以加深印象。虽然是分享数字文具盒，但我还是要提醒大家，不要盲目迷恋数字技术，有时回归实体也不失为一个好方法。
论文期刊网站
刚步入大学时我还没有查论文期刊的习惯，有啥新碰到的专业术语还是第一时间去查百度，得到的结果往往不知所云，有时还有很多纰漏。作为在校大学生，一般都是可以免费访问学校购买过的知网、维普、百度学术等网站的论文资源的，国外的论文也可以查谷歌学术和Sci-Hub，这些都比百度搜索出来的结果靠谱的多。
关于学术搜索有一个技巧，就是多使用「高级搜索」功能，可以找到更加准确的结果。有时你想搜索的一个定理可能不包含在论文标题中，这时在高级搜索中使用关键词搜索就会更容易检索到。以知网为例：

我想要搜索热传导当中一个叫「傅里叶定律」的东西，但直接在主题中搜索，结果太少，于是我在高级搜索中在左边选择关键…</span>
