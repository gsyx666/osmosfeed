                              <span>We are building Offen, a fair and self hosted web analytics software that treats operators and users as equal parties. Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s been happening over the past five months. 
We are very pleased that @appwrite is supporting us as part of their initiative to promote the Open Source community. Big thanks guys for being our first GitHub sponsor! We really appreciate the recognition and generous funding. It helps us to continue to improve Offen Fair Web Ananlytics and make the web a better place.
Users of Firefox, Chrome and Edge can now install our companion browser extension Offen Istant Access that keeps track of all Offen Fair Web Ananlytics instances they have visited. The extension detects if there is an official installation running on the currently open website and displays a link to the dedicated Auditorium. Read our Offen blog post to learn more.
Also, our consent banner and the Auditorium for operators as well as users can be displayed in one more locale. Offen is now available in English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish and, most recently, Vietnamese. Thanks to the wonderful contribution by @hiensarahly.

                              <span>Hello coders!
This article mentions an open-source library for Django which provides an easy way to build a data tables interface for any model defined in a project. The source code, published on GitHub (MIT license), can be installed via PIP, extended, or used as it is in commercial projects or eLearning activities.
Thanks for reading!
👉 Django Dyamic DataTables - Source code

👉 Django Dyamic DataTables - Sample project



The sample project mentioned above was coded during this short video that starts from an empty project.








  
  
  ✨ Library Highlights


The library can be used to prototype fast data tables UIs using minimal configuration and no coding. Once a new model is migrated to the database and the library configured to use it, the UI is ready to manage the data without writing any code using a simple data table layout.
Here is the required configuration for a model
DYNAMIC_DATATB &#x3D; {
    # SLUG -&gt; Import_PATH 
    &#x27;cities&#x27;  : &quot;app2.models.City&quot;,
}

The above snippet enables the Dynamic Data Table module for the City model defined in the app2 Django application.
class City(models.Model):     
name    &#x3D; models.CharField(max_length&#x3D;100)    
info    &#x3D; models.CharField(max_length&#x3D;100, default&#x3D;&#x27;&#x27;)    
visited &#x3D; models.CharField(max_length&#x3D;100, default&#x3D;&#x27;false&#x27;)

Using the model definition, the UI is automatically generated and presented to the users.
Might be important to mention that all future updates on the model (add, remove fields) are reflected in the UI without writing code.

                              <span>Software development  is as in-demand as it could possibly be today. Big and small companies alike (and even independent entrepreneurs) are regularly hiring software developers to create programs, applications, and various online tools.
But just like with anything else, software development requires proper planning to create a product successfully. Hence, here’s why you need a software development project brief and how you can write one yourself.
A software development project brief is pretty much what it sounds like. It is a project brief or plan for developing some kind of software – a program,  app, or online tool. A software development project brief is necessary to plan out how you will be developing your software and what you will need for it.
At the same time, such project briefs ar…</span>

N denotes the number of operations for a range.
N &#x3D;&#x3D; 10^5 - One of the most sought-after constraints in competitive programming and interviews and a boundary line solution to your code in the front of the interviewer. The Time Complexity encompassing under it are O(N), O(N*logN(base2)) and O(N*root(N))


N &#x3D;&#x3D; 10^6 - The increment of a single power will bar the later one to keep only O(N) and O(N*logN(base2)) enclosed.


N &gt;&#x3D; 10^9 - The one supportive complexity at this point is O(logN) with all the other failing at such an insurmountable number of operations. Binary Search much?.


N &#x3D;&#x3D; 10^3 - Apart from O(N), it extends its support to O(N^2) and O(N^2 * logN) solutions. This one is a Breath of fresh air to the beginners.


N &#x3D;&#x3D; 10^2 - The cubic computations are allowed in this special case. Going the brute force might not be a sign of concern in this case. You can opt for O(N), O(N^2), O(N^3) and O(N^3*logN) solutions beforehand. 


N &lt;&#x3D; 20 - Exponential complexity is accepted in this constraint with recursion and backtracking the goto approach for solving such problems.



Problem Categorization

1. 10^2 - Brute force/ Greedy
2. 10^5 - Sorting/ Combinations on Binary Search 
3. 10^8 - HashMap/ Sliding Window/Two Pointer/Stack/Queue
4. 10^10 - Binary Search
5. 4-20 - Recursion/Backtracking

As obvious, all of them are going to support O(1) in case you are wizard enough at an interview. Hope this helps you with interview. Grind Hard till You Make It.</span>

Many software engineers these days are trying to automate their work by looking for tools to speed up their work. And one of the parts that developers are trying to hack is the creation of applications in general, or at least the automation of routine work when creating  web  applications.
Almost all modern web applications, regardless of the technologies you choose, start out pretty much the same and have the same components, even if the tasks for these applications will differ cardinally.
For example, most web applications will have the following components:
  CRUD  functions;
  Authentication and authorization;
  Login and registration pages;
  Forms and tables;
  Setup of the initial project;
  Connecting DB to back-end and back-end to front-end;

                              <span>The world of software development is changing faster than ever. The need for faster release cycle times has led to a proliferation of virtualization technologies. Virtual machines (VMs) have been around for many years, but containers have recently overshadowed them. The reason is that VMs are slower and not as lightweight as containers. With the popularity of microservices, containers have emerged as an excellent alternative to virtual machines for developing, testing and deploying applications in a lightweight environment. 
There comes Docker, an open-source technology that uses Linux containers to virtualize apps and other software processes so they can run independently and more securely in another container as if they were separate computer programs on the same device.

                              <span>You can use various scripting languages to do web scraping, and PHP is certainly one to try! It’s a general-purpose language and one of the most popular options for web development. For example, WordPress, the most common content management system for creating websites, is built using PHP.

PHP offers various building blocks required to build a web scraper, although it can quickly become an increasingly complicated task. Conveniently, many open-source libraries can make web scraping with PHP more accessible.
This post will guide you through the step-by-step process of writing various PHP web scraping routines you can employ to extract public data from static and dynamic web pages.
Let’s get started!

                              <span>I recently heard about Preact and learned that high-traffic sites like IKEA, Bing, Etsy, and others use Preact, so I got curious about it. I wanted to know how Preact works under the hood and the similarities and differences between react and preact, so I decided to learn it. This series is my journey learning preact and my thoughts on it.
I recommend signing up and creating a preact code in nexuscode.online to follow along.
Like React, Preact uses virtual DOM. A Virtual DOM is a simple description of a tree structure using objects:
let vdom &#x3D; {
  type: &#x27;p&#x27;,         // a 
 element
  props: {
    class: &#x27;big&#x27;,    // with class&#x3D;&quot;big&quot;
    children: [
      &#x27;Hello World!&#x27; // and the text &quot;Hello World!&quot;
    ]
  }
}

Preact provides a way to construct these descriptions, which can then be comp…</span>

Dart is an open-source general-purpose programming language. It is originally developed by Google and later approved as a standard by ECMA. Dart is a new programming language meant for the server as well as the browser. Introduced by Google, the Dart SDK ships with its compiler – the Dart VM. The SDK also includes a utility -dart2js, a transpiler that generates JavaScript equivalent of a Dart Script. This tutorial provides a basic level understanding of the Dart programming language.
// Variable  - You can assign int bool or string anything you like

var thisIsVariable &#x3D; &quot;string&quot;

// String - Both double Quotes and Single Quotes

String thisIsString &#x3D; &quot;&quot;;

// Integer Type

int thisIsInteger &#x3D; 0;

// Float Type - we use double keyword as float

double thisIsFloat &#x3D; 380.04;

The node component is a component that runs on every node, and it&#x27;s responsible for maintaining running pods and providing the Kubernetes runtime environment.
It closely connects with the Kubernetes API and receives and sends data from its node.
Each node runs two main components a kubelet and a container runtime. Let&#x27;s take a look at what each one does.
The kubelet is responsible for establishing and acting on the communication between the Control Plane and the node.
The container runtime is in charge of pulling the relevant image from the image registry, unpacking them, and running them on the node.
Besides the two main components, we also get the kube-proxy which runs on each node. It&#x27;s responsible for maintaining network rules on each node. It makes sure the communication between nodes and pods is as expected.

                              <span>my blog started as a challenge: writing 100 articles in 100 days. With the advent of AI-powered creative tools, I started wondering: How long would it take to write 100 articles with today&#x27;s tools?

This is what this project set out to explore.

All of the articles you see on this website have been written by AI in only... two hours 🫠

This project is a demo of what can be achieved as a small team or a solo founder with AI as a creative copilot. If you&#x27;ve been wondering...

📝 How to produce SEO-friendly content at scale
📝 How to quickly generate relevant content to promote your product
📝 How to consistently produce articles for your blog without a large team of content writers

... then I think you&#x27;ll find this project interesting. All of the tools I used as well as a video walkthrough can be find on the product&#x27;s about page.

I hope you enjoy it and you learn a thing or two - happy to answer any questions! ✨

                              <span>很多人会把人生比喻为游戏，因为都需要在既定的规则下，和他人同台竞争谋求最大胜利，读书时的升学排名，就业后岗位的激烈竞争，无一不是要决出个胜负，每个人都要追求赢。
但我们可能从来没有想过，除了参加有输赢的游戏，其实我们还可以选择另一种游戏——没有输赢，可以持续玩下去的游戏。
这便是《有限与无限的游戏》中的观点，它认为世界上至少有有限和无限两种游戏，有限游戏以获胜为目的，无限游戏以延续游戏为目的。
很神奇的是，我之前从《游戏改变世界》这本书中首次知晓该理论时，只是觉得有意思，但对我并没什么启发。

可是真的当我自己看完这本20万字的小书后，对我的影响却是立竿见影的。我读完隔天，在工作上和同事发生冲突时，脑子里一直在想着“不行，我不能像对方一样发火，我要玩的是无限游戏，争一时的输赢的玩不下去了”，因此就忍住了火气，最终也顺利解决了问题。
所以呢今天也为大家推荐这本书，看完后你一定会觉得，哇，原来有些竞争是根本没必要投入的，原来选择还可以有这么多，生活的改变从心态的改变开始，相信你也可以和我一样豁然开朗！
不过该书其实是本哲学书，理解和解读起来有一定难度，而且写法更偏意识流，作者没有特意去构建严密的框架和推理，甚至全书中作者自己都没有直接发表过「无限游戏更好」的结论，所以我会加入个人的理解去解读以便更好地介绍，但我也只是抛砖引玉，建议大家过后去看全书。
一、有限与无限游戏的基本概念
有限游戏有三个显著特征。

它是以取胜为目的，一旦决出胜负则游戏结束，所以称之为有限游戏，注意这里的胜负必须是所有参与者认同，而不是裁判或观众认同。
参与者只能在游戏界限内进行游戏。
有限游戏的规则一经所有参与者认同就生效，且不能改变，否则就是另一个游戏了。

怎么样，听起来是不是很熟悉，几乎跟我们从小到大遇到的竞争一个模式。而无限游戏则恰好是跟它反着来的，它也有三个相对的显特征。

它并非以取胜为目的…</span>

Halloween will be here before you know it! This fun, over-the-top holiday is a great time to ponder the mortal fears of the developer in each of us. What haunts you the most, in the quiet moments just before your code starts to run?
Getting into the spirit of Halloween, I asked some Opensource.com writers: What&#x27;s the scariest code you&#x27;ve seen or written?

Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you needed to do a code review but didn&#x27;t fully understand the project? Maybe you did not review it to avoid looking like you didn&#x27;t know what you were doing.
This article assures you that there&#x27;s a better way. You don&#x27;t need to know everything to provide a code review. In fact, based on my experience, that&#x27;s quite common.
I remember when I joined Red Hat as an intern and was asked to help with code reviews. We used a system of +1 or -1 votes, and I was initially very hesitant to weigh in. I found myself asking whether when I gave a +1 on a change but then someone else voted -1, would I look foolish?
What does happen if someone votes -1 on a ch…</span>

昨天我们 报道 过，谷歌准备在 Chrome 110 中废弃 JPEG-XL 的实验性支持。对此，谷歌的一位工程师给出了他们的理由：实验性标志和代码不应该无限期地保留下去；整个生态系统没有足够的兴趣继续实验；新的图像格式并没有带来足够的增量优势；减少维护负担。而事实上，JPEG-XL d 比特流在 2020 年底才被冻结，文件格式在去年才被标准化，编码系统在今年早些时候才被标准化。

国外网友发现他的猫在“使用”百度

一位国外网友给自己的猫买了一个自动喂食器，但是他发现这个喂食器每隔五分钟就会解析一下 baidu.com 的域名。经过研究，原来这个带有摄像头、WiFi 功能和云端服务的物联网设备，会通过解析 baidu.com 来判断网络联通性。而这是硬编码到其设备代码中的，并且使用了过期的解析库。至于为什么会解析百度而不是谷歌，显然这是一台中国生产的物联网设备。

苹果公司增加了漏洞赏金，但不准备针对之前的操作系统

苹果安全博客带来了修订后的漏洞赏金的消息，有些漏洞赏金最高是以前最高赏金的两倍，一个零点击远程攻击链的理论最高赏金可达 200 万美元。但与此同时，苹果已经表示，旧的操作系统版本可能无法获得所有已知安全问题的修复。

Now that he owns Twitter, Elon Musk has given employees their first ultimatum: Meet his deadline to introduce paid verification on Twitter or pack up and leave.
The directive is to change Twitter Blue, the company’s optional, $4.99 a month subscription that unlocks additional features, into a more expensive subscription that also verifies users, according to people familiar with the matter and internal correspondence seen by The Verge. Twitter is currently planning to charge $19.99 for the new Twitter Blue subscription. Under the current plan, verified users would have 90 days to subscribe or lose their blue checkmark. Employees working on the project were told on Sunday that they need to meet a deadline of November 7th to launch the...

JPEG-XL 作为一种免版税的下一代有损/无损图像格式，其性能比 JPEG 好得多，因此被人们所看好。JPEG-XL 部分是基于谷歌的 PIK 提案，该文件格式在去年才被标准化。自 Chrome 91 以来，谷歌浏览器通过一个功能标志启用 JPEG-XL 支持，但谷歌正在考虑在 Chrome 110 中废除对该图像的支持。目前还没有公开的评论，说明他们放弃 JPEG-XL 的理由，但是谷歌方面一直在积极推广他们的 WebP 格式。

老王点评：看来还是谷歌觉得 JPEG-XL 不够亲儿子。




VMware 为过期版本修补了一个高危漏洞

VMware 修补了一个影响其 VMware Cloud Foundation 和 NSX Manager 产品的高危漏洞，该漏洞允许未经授权的黑客以最高的系统权限执行恶意代码。该漏洞危险等级 9.8/10，存在于其所依赖的 XStream 开源库中，因为危险是如此之高，VMware 不同寻常的为不再支持的版本发布了补丁。

老王点评：还不错，还会为停止支持的过期产品提供安全补丁。




FreeBSD 再次引入 WireGuard

早在 2020 年，FreeBSD 就引入了 WireGuard，但后来发现其初始实现代码太烂，而在 FreeBSD 13 RC 期间被移除。后来，WireGuard 的上游开发者亲自出手参与了其在 FreeBSD 的实现，经过两年的精细打磨，终于在周五重新进入了 FreeBSD 内核。预计它将出现在 FreeBSD 14 中，之前版本的 FreeBSD 也将会向后移植。

                              <span>计划为工作安装 Python 3.10？以下是在 Ubuntu 和相关发行版中安装 Python 3.10 的方法。


Python 3.10 于 2021 年 10 月 25 日发布，具有附加功能和更新。此版本带来了更好的错误消息处理、新的模式匹配功能、类型别名TypeAlias、用户定义的类型保护等。你可以在 此处 阅读发布重点。

在编写本指南时，大多数当前发行版都采用 Python 3.10。例如，Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 和 Fedora 36 默认都有 Python 3.10。

也就是说，如果你现在在任何不支持的版本中需要 Python 3.10，你可以使用 下面的可靠 PPA 在 Ubuntu 中安装最新的 Python 3.10。下面是方法。

如何在 Ubuntu 上安装 Python 3.10

此 PPA 可用于 Ubuntu 21.10、Ubuntu 21.04、Ubuntu 20.04 LTS、Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 和 Linux Mint 20.x、Elementary OS 6 和其他相关的基于 Ubuntu 的发行版。这些发行版大多数默认情况下不支持 3.10。

打开终端并添加以下 PPA：

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa


使用以下命令刷新缓存：

sudo apt update 


并使用以下命令安装 Python 3.10：

sudo apt install python3.10


设置 Python 版本

将 Python 3.10 设置为默认值需要一些额外的步骤。如下。


警告：你的 Ubuntu 系统中的许多应用程序依赖于 Python 3.9 的库存版本。因此，请确保你的工作应用（例如 GIMP、G…</span>

                              <span>GNOME 有了一个全新的文本编辑器，以取代旧的 Gedit 编辑器。

虽然 GNOME 42 已经可以使用了它，但 Ubuntu 22.04 还依赖于 Gedit。

这在 Ubuntu 22.10 中发生了变化。 GNOME 文本编辑器Text Editor 现在是默认程序，甚至没有安装 Gedit。



虽然新编辑器足够好，但并不是每个人都喜欢它。如果你将 Gedit 与其他插件一起频繁使用，则尤其如此。

如果你属于这类人，让我向你展示如何在 Ubuntu 上安装 Gedit。我还将分享如何将其设为默认文本编辑器。

在 Ubuntu 上安装 Gedit

这实际上是不费吹灰之力的。虽然默认未安装 Gedit，但它仍然可以在 Ubuntu 仓库中找到。

所以，你所要做的就是使用 apt 命令来安装它：

sudo apt install gedit


Gedit 也可以在软件中心中找到，但它是 Snap 包。如果你愿意，你可以安装它。



安装 Gedit 插件（可选）

默认情况下，Gedit 为你提供访问一些插件的选项。你可以从 “汉堡菜单-&gt;偏好Preference-&gt;插件Plugins” 启用或禁用插件。



你可以在这里看到可用的插件。检查已安装或正在使用的插件。



但是，你可以通过安装 gedit-plugins 元数据包将插件选择提升到一个新的水平。

sudo apt install gedit-plugins


这将使你可以访问其他插件，如书签、括号补全、Python 控制台等。



提示：如果你发现 Gedit 因缺少底角而显得有些格格不入，你可以安装一个名为 Round Bottom Corner 的 GNOME 扩展。这将为包括 Gedit 在内的所有应用强制添加圆底角。

使 Gedit 成为默认文本编辑器

好了！你已经安装了 Gedit，但文本文件仍然在双击操作后使用 GNOME 文本编辑器打开。要使用 Gedit 打开文件，你需要右键单击，然后选择“打开方式open with”选项。

如果你希望一直使用 Gedit 打开文本文件，你可以将其设置为默认程序。

右键单击文本文件并选择“打开方式open with”选项。在此处选择 Gedit 并从底部启用“始终用于此文件类型Always use for this file type”选项。



删除 Gedit

觉得 Gedit 没达到预期么？这很少见，但我不会评判你。要从 Ubuntu 中删除 Gedit，请使用以下命令：

sudo apt remove gedit


你也可以尝试从软件中心卸载它。

总结

GNOME 文本编辑器是下一代从头开始创建的编辑器，它与新的 GNOME 完美融合。

对于简单的文本编辑来说已经足够了。然而，Gedit 有一个插件生态系统，赋予它更多功能。

对于那些将它广泛用于编码和其他事情的人来说，安装 Gedit 仍然是 Ubuntu 中的一个选项。

那你呢？你会坚持使用默认的新文本编辑器还是回到旧的 Gedit？

                              <span>组织层面的自动化一直是一个难以实现的目标，但 Kubernetes 或许能够改变这一切。


当我在 2002 年采用 Gentoo Linux 作为我的主要操作系统时，我开始了我的自动化之旅。二十年后，自动化还没有完成。当我与客户和合作伙伴会面时，他们分享了团队内部的自动化成果，但他们也描述了在组织层面实现类似成功所面临的挑战。

大多数 IT 组织都能够端到端地提供虚拟机，从而将过去 4 周的交付周期缩短到仅 5 分钟。这种级别的自动化本身就是一个复杂的工作流程，需要网络（IP 地址管理、DNS、代理、网络区域等）、身份访问管理、虚拟机管理程序、存储、备份、更新操作系统、应用最新的配置文件、监控、安全和强化以及合规性基准测试，等等。哇，这么多！

满足高速、可扩展和按需自动化的业务需求并不容易。例如，来看看经典的网上商店或提交纳税申报表的在线政府服务，其工作负载有明确的峰值需要面对。

处理此类负载的一种常见方法是拥有一个超大的服务器集群，以供 IT 专业人员的特定团队使用，监控客户或公民的季节性涌入。每个人都希望及时部署整个栈。他们希望基础架构在混合云场景的上下文中运行工作负载，使用“构建-消耗-回收build-consume-trash”模型来优化成本，同时从无限弹性中受益。

换句话说，每个人都想要乌托邦式的“云体验”。

云真的能交付吗？

尚有一线机会，这主要归功于 Kubernetes 的设计方式。Kubernetes 的指数级普及推动了创新，取代了管理平台和应用的标准传统做法。 Kubernetes 需要使用 “万物皆代码Everything-as-Code”（EaC）来定义从简单的计算节点到 TLS 证书的所有资源的期望状态。Kubernetes 强制使用三种主要的设计结构：


一个标准接口，以减少内部和外部组件之间的整合问题

API 优先及仅 API 的方法来标准化其所有组件的 CRUD（创建、读取、更新、删除）操作

使用 YAML 作为通用语言，以简单易读的方式定义这些组件的所有所需状态


这三个关键组成部分基本上是选择自动化平台的相同要求，至少如果你想让跨职能团队轻松采用是这样的。这也模糊了团队之间的职责分工，有助于提高跨越孤岛的协作，这是一件好事！

事实上，采用 Kubernetes 的客户和合作伙伴正在加速进入超自动化状态。Kubernetes 有机地推动团队采用多种 DevOps 基础和实践，如：EaC、使用 Git 进行版本控制、同行评审、文档即代码Documentation as Code，并鼓励跨职能协作。这些实践有助于提高团队的自动化技能，并帮助团队在处理应用生命周期和基础架构的 GitOps 和 CI/CD 管道方面取得良好的开端。

让自动化成为现实

你没看错！网络商店或政府报告等复杂系统的整个栈可以用清晰、可理解、通用的术语定义，可以在任何本地或云提供商上执行。可以定义具有自定义指标的自动伸缩器以触发所需栈的即时部署，以解决季节性高峰期间客户或市民的涌入问题。当指标恢复正常，且云计算资源不再有存在的理由时，你将它们回收并恢复常规运营，而由一组核心资产在本地接管业务，直到下一次激增。

鸡和蛋的悖论

考虑到 Kubernetes 和云原生模式，自动化是必须的。但它提出了一个重要的问题：一个组织可以在解决自动化战略之前采用 Kubernetes 吗？

似乎从 Kubernetes 开始可以激发更好的自动化，但这并不是一个一成不变的结论。工具不是对技能、实践和文化问题的解决方案。但是，设计良好的平台可以成为 IT 组织内学习、变革和跨职能协作的催化剂。

开始使用 Kubernetes

即使你觉得自己错过了自动化列车，也不要害怕从简单、不复杂的栈上开始使用 Kubernetes。当你 掌握了初始步骤，就可以拥抱这个出色的编排系统的简单性，并根据更复杂的需求进行迭代。

                              <span>滚动发布的 Ubuntu 发行版？等等，什么？ Rhino Linux 听起来不错……




Rhino Linux 将成为 Rolling Rhino Remix 的继任者。这个由 http.llamaz 构建的 Linux 发行版，提供了滚动发布的非官方的 Ubuntu 变体版本。

需要澄清的是，该项目从未旨在取代其他稳定的发行版，而纯粹是一个充满乐趣的激情项目。

而随着人们开始将其用作日常使用并对其期望更多，开发人员决定将其变成一个严肃的项目。

Rhino Linux 作为它的继任者。那么，你对它的期待是什么？

有请继任者 Rhino Linux

其主要目标是提供稳定的 Ubuntu 体验，同时仍提供滚动发布模式。

目标仍保持不变，但 Rhino Linux 的基础将得到彻底改变。他们有可能使它成为一个令人印象深刻的滚动发布的 Ubuntu 发行版。

听起来很令人兴奋！🤯

在其核心，Rhino Linux 将使用稍微修改过的 Xfce 版本作为其桌面环境；之所以选择它是因为它众所周知的稳定性和速度。

Rhino Linux 的创始人提到了以下几点：


滚动版 Ubuntu 仍然是我们的核心理念。Rhino Linux 并不是从 Rolling Rhino Remix 中分离出来的，而是将它重新设想为更稳定、更成熟的发行版，它原本就应该以这种方式出厂。




除此之外，Pacstall 将用作 Rhino Linux 上的默认包管理器及其存储库之一。


💡 Pacstall 是一个受 AUR 启发的 Ubuntu 包管理器。


Pacstall 的开发由其创始人 Plasma 领导。他还作为新开发人员之一（副项目负责人）加入，而 Sourajyoti Basak 作为另一位核心成员加入。

前进：可用性和发布

在撰写本文时，Rhino Linux 尚未确定任何具体的发布日期，但你可以预计它会在 2023 年的某个时间发布。

Rolling Rhino Remix 会发生什么？

开发者澄清说，它将在 Rhino Linux 发布后继续维护三个月。但是，在 2022 年 1 月 11 日后继发布之后，它没有新的发布镜像。

你可以通过访问其 官方网站 了解更多关于 Rhino Linux 的信息。

💬 你觉得 Rhino Linux 怎么样？它可以成为值得尝试的官方 Ubuntu 风格的竞争者吗？

上几篇专栏介绍了绿色系、蓝色系，自然少不了光学三原色的另一名成员——红色。这一期来讲讲红色系键帽，方便各位键友选购搭配自己的梦中情键。

GMK Red Samurai 红武士
R1 2018.2 R2 2020
BASE
这套键帽是由设计师Redsun（红太阳）设计而成，同时他也是GMK蓝武士的设计师，gmk四大武士中的两款由他设计。关于这套键帽的灵感来源有两个版本。
在R1的IC中。

作者表示灵感来自于火影忍者中宇智波斑的铠甲颜色

而在R2中

作者则表示灵感来源于井伊直政（日本历史角色）
关于作者灵感来源，我还是更加倾向于R1中的说法，而为何要改口，可能是为了规避版权问题，但我个人觉得，在红武士中其实并不能看出过多来自于漫画中的角色要素，并且忍者和武士也是两种职业，作者关于忍者和武士的定义，好像也并没有非常清晰。
配色：

暗黄、深红、灰黑，低调而不失深度的配色，黑红相间配以金色点缀，经典耐看。
个性部分：

这一套的个性数量和种类都非常丰富“忍”“侍”，其实这一套键帽虽然称之为武士，但里面也融合了非常多忍者的元素，在武器类型中“飞镰”、“团扇”、“手里剑”、“苦无”，都是非常常见的忍者标志性武器，还有一些不明所以的图案。
其实这位作者在R1中的早期个性设计，是带有浓烈火影忍者特色的。
早期个性设计
穿着盔甲的天狗，很显然是宇智波斑的须佐能乎，以及极其明显的神威万花筒写轮眼图案。
但在最终敲定版本中为了规避版权问题进行了大刀阔斧的修改，最终便呈现出一个极具忍者风味的武士主题键帽。

搭配建议：
深色无疑是合适的，这套键帽很是百搭，红色、蓝色、黄色，都能驾驭，我个人最喜欢灰色和黑色进行搭配，红色也是很不错的，但过于鲜亮的颜色搭配起来难度还是…</span>

                              <span>相信大部份人用的都是拼音輸入法。
學會一個非拼音的中文輸入法，是一件好玩的事，這是一項實用的技能，能證明你的智商和學習能力。
以後搞博客，工作，寫作，成為作家，跟人聊天，等等很多地方都能用上。
其實很多人對「形碼」還存在誤解。

誤解一，除了拼音就是五筆。
其實形碼是一衆不以拼音而是字形部件組合來輸入中文的方法。著名的有：倉頡、鄭碼、五筆，等等。
其中五筆是最有名，但又是最難學最難用的。
誤解二，形碼一定比拼音快。
其實形碼並不一定比拼音快，比如我用倉頡打「哈哈哈哈」，我輸入的是「romr romr romr romr 」，而拼音只需要輸入「hhhh 」。
也就是說，在某些特定場合，拼音，簡拼，比形碼還要快。
那形碼的優點是甚麼？形碼不是快，而是準。形碼人的思維是，如果連準確輸入都做不到，那快有甚麼用？
誤解三，五筆（形碼）很難，要背很多字根。
其實是因為五筆的字根太多太難背，才會給人這樣的感受。我用過五筆兩年，我也承認背字根是一個非常高的門檻。
但是，並不是所有形碼都跟五筆一樣難背。倉頡輸入法的字元就比五筆少很多，好記很多，記下根本不費吹灰之力。
誤解四，學個輸入法要浪費很多時間，學會了也沒甚麼用。
這是極其錯誤的想法。中文打字，不管到哪裏，都是實用的技能。現在網上到處都是同音錯字，比如「再在」不分，就是因為拼音輸入法根本打不準。那麼如果你跟別人文字聊天時，或者發表文章時，能做到用字準確，那不就是一個加分項嗎？
因此，花費一點時間，去學一個形碼，是事半功倍的事。一個好的中文輸入法，是可以用一輩子的。而你只需要用掉幾日的時間來學習。

先寫到這裏。我是中文輸入法專家尹卂，目前在用倉頡。有甚麼問題可以在下方留言。</span>

从现在起，广泛使用的 Adobe 应用程序，如 Photoshop、Illustrator 和 InDesign 将不再免费支持 Pantone 公司的颜色，那些希望在他们的文件中使用这些颜色的人将需要支付一个单独的许可证。你需要使用一个每月 15 美元的插件才能使用这些颜色。

为修复高危漏洞，Fedora 37 推迟发布

Fedora Linux 37 的发布日期从原计划的 10 月底推迟到 11 月 15 日，原因是为了修复一个 OpenSSL 高危漏洞。OpenSSL 计划在 11 月 1 日释出修复漏洞的补丁，因此关于该漏洞的细节尚未公开。安全社区的一种通常做法是在补丁做好准备前对相关信息保密，以防止其被利用。由于 Fedora 是公开构建的，所以不能在漏洞披露前就先打好补丁。但有趣的是，即使发布延迟，但是定于 11 月 4-5 日的 Fedora Linux 37 发布派对会照常举行。

老王点评：开源项目的开放性往往都是好的，但是在这个情况下，却是一个弱点。




Linux 6.2 主线内核将支持苹果 M1 系列芯片

本周，苹果 M1 Pro、Max 和 Ultra SoC 的设备树排队进入 Linux 内核 SoC 的 for-next 分支。也就是说，对 M1 系列芯片的支持进入了上游，而且使用这些 SoC 的 Mac Studio 也将得到支持。最终，基于 Arm 的苹果芯片将在 Linux 上得到很好的开箱即用的支持，而不仅仅是 Asahi Linux 发行版。

                              <span>马上就到万圣节了，太棒啦！

我相信你已经有了一些庆祝万圣节的想法。给你的 Linux 桌面做一个像幽灵般的黑暗改造，就类似于下面的屏幕截图，你觉得怎么样？



可定制是 Linux 的一大优势，对 Linux 可进行的定制是多种多样且没有尽头的。之前，我们向你展示过 如何让你的 Linux 看起来像 macOS 的方法。今天，我将继续分享一些定制“万圣节”Linux 桌面的技巧。

可以通过主题、图标、扩展、字体、Conky 等一系列配置组合起来，来实现 Linux 桌面的定制。虽然，你可以在任何的 Linux 发行版和桌面环境中配置这些东西，但是仅在一个教程中展示所有 Linux 发行版和桌面环境的桌面定制方法，是不太可行的。

因此，在本文中，我将介绍 Ubuntu 与 GNOME 桌面环境的桌面定制方法。

安装所需工具

你需要一些软件包和工具。在开始定制桌面前，请确保你安装了全部（或大多数）的软件包和工具。

你不必做所有这些桌面改变。但你做的越多，你的桌面也会美化得更好看。

安装 GNOME 优化工具和 GMOME 扩展管理器

使用以下命令，来安装 GNOME 优化Tweaks 工具和 GMOME 扩展管理器（Extensions manager）：

sudo apt install gnome-tweaks gnome-extension-manager


在基于 KDE 的 Linux 系统中，没有可以更改 Linux 桌面外观的优化工具。但是，你可以使用 Kvantum-Manager 这一应用程序来更改外观，请参考我在 KDE 主题指南 中的讨论。

安装 Conky（可选）

你可以选择是否要安装 Conky ，因为现在 conky-manager 项目已经不再维护了，因此继续使用 Conky 可能会有点棘手。…</span>

                              <span>你想了解 Base64 编码和解码的方法吗？在本教程中，我们使用 Bash shell 脚本和各种示例解释了 Base64 编码和解码步骤。




Base64 编码方法可以将二进制数据转换为文本，如此编码数据可以在任何通信媒介进行传输。这种编码方法主要用于电子邮件加密的过程。

总体而言，Base64 编码方法是一种二进制到文本的编码方案，以 ASCII 字符串格式表示 8 字节的二进制数据。使用这种编码方法在各种媒介之间传输数据时有几个优势，尤其是对于那些能可靠地支持文本内容的媒介。因此，Base64 编码方法在万维网上被广泛使用。这种编码方案最常用于电子邮件附件的编码上。

根据 Base64 编码表，二进制数据可以经 Base64 编码后可以转换为 64 个不同的 ASCII 字符，包含大写字母 A 到 Z，小写字母 a 到 z，数字 0 到 9，以及符号 + 和 /，这些字符在传输和打印上十分便捷。

这 64 个 ASCII 字符代表着从 000000 到 111111 的二进制值。每个非末尾的 Base64 编码字符恰好代表 6 位二进制值。



Bash base64 的编码和解码

句法

在我们提供示例之前，首先介绍 Base64 的基本语法。

base64 [OPTIONs] [INFILE] [OUTFILE]



选项（Option）：参照下面的表格，你可以提供任何的选项或组合多个选项。

输入（INFILE）：你可以从标准输入（如命令行）或文件中输入。

输出（OUTFILE）：你可以将输出重定向到标准输出，如终端或文件中。

                              <span>Xubuntu 22.10 提供了精致的 Xfce 体验。请读此文了解详情。




Xubuntu 是基于 Xfce 的 Ubuntu 官方版本。

它也是最好的轻量级 Linux 发行版之一。

随着最新的 Xubuntu 22.10 “Kinetic Kudu” 版本，你可以看到改进的桌面环境、添加的功能，以及全面的细化。

Xubuntu 22.10 的新变化



Xubuntu 22.10 带来了一些令人兴奋的升级。一些亮点包括：


Xfce 4.16（或 Xfce 4.17 开发版）

Catfish 的外观进行了更新。

更新了新图标，弃用了 elementary-xfce-darker 主题。

Mousepad 搜索历史。

Thundar 文件管理器的改进。

Xfce 任务管理器。



💡 Xubuntu 22.10 将支持九个月，直到 2023 年 7 月。如果你想要稳定性而不是功能，你应该首选使用 LTS 版本。


Xfce 4.17 开发版还是 Xfce 4.16？

Xubuntu 22.10 的发行说明说它专门提供了 Xfce 4.17 开发版本。

但是，当我安装 Xubuntu 22.10 的 beta 版本（并将其更新到最新版本）时，只具有 Xfce 4.16。



不确定他们是否退出了 Xfce 4.17 开发版本，或者 Xfce 4.16 现在是否存在。

Catfish 外观



Catfish 是 Xubuntu 上的一个文件搜索工具。通过新的升级，它具有焕然一新的外观，并做了底层的改进。

与你搜索的文件交互时，你还会获得一个“打开方式”上下文菜单。



Catfish 还添加了一些细微而有用的功能。

GNOME 43 软件应用

在值得注意的应用程序更新中，GNOME 的最新软件中心是一个不错的选择。这是 Xubuntu 22.10 的外观：



当然，它可能无法与 Xfce 上的其他应用程序保持一致，但我认为你应该不会介意。

图标更新

随着 elementary-xfce 0.17 图标更新，有许多新图标和更简洁的选项，可提供一致的 Xubuntu 桌面体验。



此外，elementary-xfce-darkest 主题图标包已被弃用。



任务管理器右键选项



你现在可以将完整的进程路径复制到剪贴板。这对于需要从命令行进行故障排除或停止操作很有用。

其他增强功能



还有其他几个值得注意的变化，包括：


Linux 内核 5.19。

Firefox 浏览器 105。

Alt-Tab 视图通过更突出的图标进行了改进。

马赛克拼图添加到 SGT 拼图系列。

Mousepad 文本编辑器现在包括搜索历史记录，以及更多调整。


要了解有关更改的更多信息，请查看 官方发行说明。

下载 Xubuntu 22.10

你可以从 Ubuntu 的中央镜像库 或它的 官方网站 下载最新的 ISO 文件。

官方网站可能需要一段时间才能提供 ISO。


下载Xubuntu 22.10


💬 你觉得 Xubuntu 22.10 如何？请在评论中告诉我。

Matrix is a popular open source chat application that makes it easy to chat securely with people all over the world. Similarly, Discord is a non-open source chat application that&#x27;s also popular with many online communities. Discord, like Matrix, provides a chat client for all major platforms both mobile and desktop, so it&#x27;s perfectly usable on Linux. However, it&#x27;s not open source and so, given the choice, you might prefer to use Matrix. The good news is that when not given a choice for any reason, you can also use Matrix to interface with Discord by running a Matrix-to-Discord bridge. This article shows you how to set up and run a Python Matrix bot to bridge chat between a Matrix room and a Discord channel.

2019年，热插拔结构萌芽

在2019年，客制化键盘圈子当中，热插拔结构逐渐普及开来。那个时候我是一个很普通的键盘小白。只想要一个高端机械键盘，来满足我一个手游程序员的日常工作需求。而客制化键盘需要买家亲自去组装键盘的所有零部件。而安装轴体对于小白来说，就是一个非常巨大的门槛。在当时安装轴体的方法有两种，一种就是传统的焊接，需要用户学习焊接的基础知识，需要购买焊台，焊锡。学习焊接轴体的操作技巧，操作不当，还有可能把键盘电路板烧毁，损毁轴体。因为客制化键盘都是采用团购的形式，制作工期极长，所有的零件都是根据购买量定制的，电路板有个三长两短，再找一块电路板来，就不是那么容易的事情了，焊接完成之后，想要更换轴体，更是一件麻烦事，需要重新拆解键盘，学习使用吸锡器。键盘带有热插拔结构之后，只需要在安装之前，掌握轴体的安装方向，轻轻一按，轴体就安装完成了。可以说是小白新手的福音，能极大的降低客制化键盘圈子的入圈门槛。
而在当时，愿意增加热插拔结构的客制化键盘，却非常的少。造成这一现象的原因，我分成两种：
一是客观原因，在当时客制化键盘的生产线，没有现如今那么强大。零件需要外包出去制作。负责生产的工厂水平参差不齐，最终生产的成品，出现划痕，刀痕，色差的情况，也是时有发生。最严重的情况就是外包的工厂心术不正，直接卷钱跑路。键盘的电路板制作也是如此。为了满足客制化键盘圈子内用户的需求，团长一般会出不同的佩列来吸引用户，比如无win键佩列，hhkb佩列，7字型回车，长空格佩列，阶梯caps lock 佩列等。加一个热插拔就意味着双倍的电路板定制需求，所以往往支持热插拔的客制化键盘，选配项都是被阉割的。甚至有可能延后补发电路板。
二是…</span>

@王百顺BS：Nutale Air Pro - Airtag下位替代品

入手渠道：淘宝
入手价格：192 元

新发布的 AirPods Pro 内置了 Airtag 又让我重新对这个去年发布的小东西提起了兴趣，恰好看到 Nutale Air Pro 打折，四个套装比单个 Airtag 还便宜，就想试试能不能作为平替。
先放两张外观的图片：
正面：金属边框，两面塑料，有一颗按键，一个发声的开槽（按键手感很差软塌塌的没有反馈）背面：有个放纽扣电池的盖子，用手一推就能打开，一颗 CR2032 纽扣电池
几天试用下来体验还不错，有「Works with Apple Find My」的认证所以可以直接在「查找」app 中的「物品」这一栏添加设备，所有的操作也都是在「查找」app 中，和查看其他 Apple 的设备操作一样。
在查找 app 中的界面，这个两个物品都是
价格便宜自然会有一些缺失的功能，比如：精确查找。 就是到达 Airtag 附近（大概 20 米以内吧）之后触发精确查找，告诉你在什么方向还有多远。 这个功能在 Nutale Air Pro 上是没有的（据说是因为 Apple 还没有开放 UWB 所以市面上还没有第三方的产品具备精确查找），你只能到达附近之后通过播放声音来寻找，声音大小用 Apple Watch 粗略测试了一下可以达到 95 分贝，装到帆布包里间隔两米声音大概 60 分贝，装在包里隔一堵墙距离大概 7 米就需要仔细听了。
精确查找：图片来自 Apple 官网截图

                              <span>前言
2022年10月24日，特斯拉官宣降价，基础版本model 3降价1.4万，model y降价2.8万，可以说是非常大的降价幅度，结合2022款整体上更新的车机芯片加上扩大的电池容量，一部分车款可以说是重回性价比车型的行列。
我们讲电车使用成本低，是基于有家用充电桩的环境，如果都用特斯拉超充，不算停车费，每公里电费都能到3毛以上，而使用谷时电家充，每公里电费可以控制在5分钱。但家充桩需要有固定车位，还要向电网申请电表，以及需要物业允许施工的证明，这些硬性条件也劝退着一些潜在车主。
而除了固定的家用充电桩，还有便携充电器，也就是随车充可以作为新能源车的补能方案。随车充在使用上可以使用家庭插座，支持自带线缆从家中接到室外充电，不需要独立电表，对于公司有插座、农村有自建房以及低楼层居民楼住户都比较友好。
本篇选择了四款随车充，覆盖了品牌、设计特点、功率支持的几个不同方向，来详细对比产品设计和具体功能，希望能为随车充的选择答疑解惑。
缆上控制与保护装置（IC-CDP)

其实随车充产品我分析过很多次，它本质上就是从电源到新能源车电机的连接装置，换言之就是一根电源线，电能转化为电池电量都是在新能源车内部完成的。而对于随车充产品消费首先需要重点关注的就是是否配备了缆上控制与保护装置，缩写为IC-CDP。
在国家标准GB/T 18487.1-2015《电动汽车传导充电系统 第一部分:通用要求》中，将就是一根电缆连接电动汽车和交流电网的随车充称为模式1产品；将电缆上加入IC-CDP的随车充产品称为模式2产品。前者可以为车充电，根据电缆长度不同售价在200元上下，但模式1产品缺乏保护功能和控制功能，便宜但抗风险能力基本为0。后者模式2则是大部分车主的核心选择，通过控制盒可以实现各种差异化功能，特斯拉、比亚迪的原厂随车充我们称为车规产品，都是模式2随车充。
对于我们私家车主而言，充电安全…</span>

A few years ago, I wrote a command-line math program for FreeDOS called VMATH. It was capable of performing only extremely simple mathematical operations on very small unsigned integers. With some recent interest in basic math in the FreeDOS community, I improved VMATH to provide basic math support on signed 64-bit integers.
The process of manipulating big numbers using only 16-bit 8086 compatible assembly instructions is not straightforward. I would like to share some samples of the techniques used by VMATH. Some of the methods used are fairly easy to grasp. Meanwhile, others can seem a little strange. You may even learn an entirely new way of performing some basic math.
The techniques explained here …</span>

The [ command, often called a &quot;test,&quot; is a command from the GNU Core Utils package, and initiates a conditional statement in Bash. Its function is exactly the same as the test command. When you want to execute a command only when something is either true or false, use the [ or the test command. However, there&#x27;s a significant difference between [ or test and [[, and there&#x27;s a technical difference between those commands and your shell&#x27;s versions of them.
[ vs test commands in Linux
The [ and the test commands, installed by the GNU Core Utils package, perform the same function using a slightly different syntax. (You might find it difficult to search for documentation using the single left-square bracket ch…</span>

2022 年，对我来说是不平凡的一年，键圈的兴亡成败在这一年格外明显。也是这一年我开始从一个消费者转变成一个创作者，遇到了更多的人，也想了了更多过去不会思考的问题。下面来讲讲我这一年的所思所想和所感，以及今后的一些打算。虽然都是些浅短的认识，但是分享出来也算是一种体验，非常感谢大家的观看和意见。欢迎评论区友好讨论。
键盘圈的大趋势
现代社会人与人的交流不再局限于过去话语和书信的形式，而更多倾向于快捷的网络输入交流。快捷频繁的信息互通使得输入工具成为生活工作长时间高频率接触的日常用品。2020 年的疫情提早将线上办公大规模地带入人们的生活之中，人们也重新开始审视自己的办公桌搭，机械键盘市场在疫情之下，不降反增。
机械键盘热度上涨这件事，无论是从日常生活中关于机械键盘话题讨论度愈发增高，还是从近些年来机械键盘品牌数急剧增加都可以得到一定程度的论证。
数据来源：什么值得买
近些年来，在机械键盘领域我能明显感知到的就是选择越来越多了，无论是量产还是客制化，无论是轴体、键帽、套件。国内机械键盘在「物质」水平上，毫无疑问的成长了。
在轴体领域，国产轴体自 2010-2012 开始萌芽，在 2019 年这个关键节点打出了名声，国内轴体市场也从 Cherry 的独角戏演变成现在的百家争鸣。
佳达隆的产品时间线 2012—2020
在键帽领域，过去的客制化玩家大多只能选择 GMK、SP 等海外品牌，如今有国产老牌客制化键帽 JTK、2019 年出现的 Domikey 和 2022 年入场的 PBTfans 以及各种各样的键帽代工厂，包括量产领域也出…</span>

                              <span>最近我在抽屉里翻出来一台尘封已久的 iPhone 5s，它刚刚在 20 年才从我手中退役，一眨眼它就快发布十年了。在用它的时候我其实对手机了解很少，也不懂摄影，就只是拿来刷网页。于是趁着这个由头，重头开始了解一下 iPhone 的一些变化。首先想写的是 iPhone 相机的一些内容，暂时先写单摄时代的 13 款机型。照例先给出我全文的脉络，供各位参考。

iPhone + iPhone OS 1 / iPhone 3G + iPhone OS 2
2007 年 1 月 9 日，乔布斯在初代 iPhone 的发布会上只用了一句话介绍其搭载的相机

看后面，最显眼的就是内置的 2 百万像素摄像头。
iPhone 发布会
 
关于相机方面大量的篇幅其实是在介绍照片软件，搭配 3.5 寸的可触摸屏幕，可以向左滑动或向右滑动查看照片，捏合放大缩小，横置手机的同时照片也跟着变换方向等。

第三个我想要展示给大家看的手机功能是照片。你知道的，我之前说过，在iPhone里内置有一台二百万像素的相机，我们也有着最酷的照片管理软件，它在移动设备中是最好的。但是我认为它在所有的平台中也都堪称最棒。这是我们的照片，我正在进入照片库，这就是照片库，在这里我可以用我的手指来滑动浏览照片，相当酷。让我们看看相册，我要选择意大利，让我们从第一张开始，我可以通过滑动手机来浏览这些照片。我可以翻看照片库，大家看这是一张风景照片，现在我调转了我的手机方向，然后它就变成了这个样子，酷吗？怎么样？当我在看这张风景照片的时候我也可以滑动它。怎么样？是不是看上去还不错？我还可以把一些照片放大，我能用我的手指来对它进行缩放。我可以让手指分开来让图片变大，酷不酷？我还能移动照片，怎么样，酷吗？还可以把照片设置为手机壁纸，这样就能设置成为壁纸。当我回到主页，然后锁屏，当我解锁之后，我设…</span>

                              <span>之前，我在《论文读不懂怎么办？》一文中，给你介绍了论文阅读遇到问题时的几个解决方法。尤其是介绍了你可以求助的免费资源和路径，它们包括但不限于：

幻灯
博客
视频
课程
代码

那篇文章，在知乎上获得了 2600 个赞（截止 2022 年 10 月）。我相信，对于很多同学，起到了帮助。

只不过，环境和技术在变化，我们解决问题的方法和思路，也应该与时俱进。
这不，因为有了大规模自然语言处理模型的加持，阅读论文时遇到不认识的名词，或者无法理解作者的简单解释时，我们有了一种新的对策。
具体的方法，就是人工智能替你阅读后，把内容综合整理，结合上下文转换成简单清晰的语言，再反馈给你。
这个想法，其实并不新鲜了。翻看近几年自然语言处理领域的论文，你能看见不少相关的研究。
只不过，那些研究成果只存在论文中，或者是在某个实验室的电脑里面，普通人根本无法接触，更不要说利用了。
这回可不一样，有人（ \@amanjha__ and \@functionofjade）居然真的就做了个产品出来。
这个应用的名字，叫做 explainpaper ，非常直白吧？

使用起来也特别方便。不用去菜单里面点选找寻。只要你把论文传上去，高亮某一个词语、短语或者段落，人工智能就会自动为你解读。

不仅如此，你还可以就着 AI 反馈的结果，继续追问。
这种应用演示不大适合图文。所以我干脆为你做了 一段演示视频，你可以先看看。
 
 
看完之后，感受如何？
反正不少小伙伴表示，很兴奋。

这东西背后的技术是啥？当然还是咱们的老熟人 ------GPT-3.
其实 GPT-3 这模型的特点，说穿了就是大。因为模型庞大，参数众多，所以从海量语料库里积攒的「认知」就多。注意我这里刻意回避了「知识」这个词儿。

（资料来源：t.ly/cY1kn）
从上图中，你不难看到，现在的文本和代码生成中，GPT-3 都占据了重要位置。
我喜欢共享内容的原因之一，是视频发出后总可以获得观众进一步的反馈。不少的问题，都会激发我的思考。
例如有小伙伴在视频后面提问，说这个东西能不能帮着理解中文论文啊？

这是个很好的问题。毕竟很多国内人文社科研究生平时阅读的论文，更大比例是中文的。
我一开始觉得这个问题问得有些太贪心了。对于一个外国人做的刚上线应用，你指望人家立即支持阅读中文，还能看懂中文的研究论文，不大现实吧？
刚要回复，我突然想起来 上次在 Lex 上面的教训了。既然 explainpaper 的底层模型是 GPT-3 ，那它本来就该认得中文啊。
为了确保回答准确，还是实际测试一下吧。我传了一篇自己的论文上去。

中文划线高亮之后，AI 反馈的结果让我有些吃惊。
尽管 explainpaper 并不能直接用中文来解释信息。但它可以立即识别出「知识管理」就是 knowledge management ，然后进一步解释下去。
下面这段解释，就更有意思了。

它先广泛解释「插件」是啥，然后结合本文的上下文，指出 Roam Toolkit 是一种插件，并且描述了它的功能。
不仅如此，从下图可以看出，就连划线的时候字符之间出现了空格间隔，也依然能正常识别和解释。

下面，我故意找了个文中没有进行详细解释的「概念网络」，结果是这样的。

我能确定，这解释里面出现的「宠物」、「猫」、「狗」啥的，肯定没在本文正文出现过。
Evernote 这一段，让我愣住了。

Explainpaper 居然是准确识别了这张表格，并且把内容总结梳理，然后用英文输出了出来。
上述的演示，是不是回答了读者的问题呢？我觉得算不上。从需求分析来看，人家看中文论文遇到术语不清楚，自然是需要中文的解释。你再弄成英文给我，这......
可换个角度想想，这东西帮助外国人阅读中文论文，可是再好不过了。遇到中文专业词汇，随时可以获得准确的英文解释，而且阐述还贴合论文的上下文。外国人读中文论文，将减少很多障碍。这或许可以快速提升中文论文的影响力，妙啊！
另外，目前 explainpaper 缺乏中文解释能力，也给国内的开发者提供了发展空间。希望早日看到更多 AI 实际应用上线，帮助国人理解中文论文。
我期待你能自己尝试一下这款在线应用。至少在目前，它是免费的。而且因为上传的都是公开发表的论文，也不存在用户隐私泄漏问题。所以可以放心大胆地尝试 ------ 特别是对于最近要写文献综述的小伙伴来说。
欢迎你把自己测试的结果和经验心得，分享在留言区。咱们一起交流讨论。
祝论文阅读愉快！

                              <span>伴随 iOS 16.1 的发布，YaoYao 也适配了 iOS 16.1 相关功能
 
 
灵动岛
当你在手表上开始运动后，再打开手机App，你将发现YaoYao 的灵动岛功能。
灵动岛在 iPhone 14 Pro 上可以使用，你可以把灵动岛理解成一个indicator。

具体有多大用，实际我也没太明白，再就是要看这个功能提供后，各路厂商的想象力，以我自己的判断，Apple 可能也没太明白，这个应该会在后面继续迭代。
实时活动（Live Activity）
这个实时活动和灵动岛是一起的，绑定的，这也是我不太能理解的地方。它不需要iPhone 14 Pro，其他手机也会显示，你可以把它理解成一个特殊的通知.
它能实时显示新跳绳的运动数据，在 iPhone 14 Pro常亮屏的加持下更加好用，个人认为常亮屏是 iPhone 14 Pro 最大的亮点，就像 Apple Watch 自从有了常亮显示，体验大大提高一样。

Apple Watch Ultra 操作按钮（Action Button)
为了适配 Apple Watch Ultra 这个特殊的自定义键（Action Button，手表左侧这个黄色键），我特意买了一个 Ultra，现在在系统里配置该键后，你就可以：
 
 
1. 一键启动YaoYao
2. 按下该键暂停运动
3. 再按下恢复运动（或和右边的侧边键同时按下）
因为不用看屏幕可以直接按，减少了心智负担，实际使用非常好用！变成了我最喜欢 Ultra的功能。之前感觉佳明表全是按键操作，不能触控，拿到手完全不会用，感觉很傻，看来也有一定道理，哈哈。

Are you looking for a way to quickly transfer files from your Windows computer to your Linux computer and back again? The open source PSCP utility makes it easy to transfer files and folders, and of course it&#x27;s open source.
Setting your PATH in Windows
Knowing how to set your command path in Windows makes it easier to use a handy utility like PSCP. If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with that process, read how to set a PATH on Windows.
Using PSCP
PSCP (PuTTY Secure Copy Protocol) is a command-line tool for transferring files and folders from a Windows computer to a Linux computer.

Download pscp.exe from its website.
Move pscp.exe to a folder in your PATH (for example, Desktop\App if you followed the PA…</span>

In the first part of this series, I illustrated what an Open Organization chart looks like based on the book Team of Teams, by Stanley McChrystal. In this second and final part, I explore concerns about the information flow using this chart and give some examples of how it might work and (possibly unknowingly) has worked in the past.
Building team-to-team adaptability, collaboration, and transparency
Sometimes activities fit exactly with a single specialty and group responsibility. Other times these responsibilities overlap, with one party having primary responsibility and another playing a more minor but important, supportive role.

The git log command offers many opportunities to learn more about the commits made by contributors. One way you might consume such information is by date. To view commits in a Git repository created on a specific date or range of dates, use the git log command with the options --since or --until, or both.

First, checkout the branch you want to inspect (for example, main):
$ git checkout main
Next, display the commits for the current date (today):
$ git log --oneline --since&#x3D;&quot;yesterday&quot;
Display commits for the current date by a specific author only (for example, Agil):
$ git log --oneline --since&#x3D;&quot;yesterday&quot; --author&#x3D;&quot;Agil&quot;
You can also display results for a range of dates. Display commits between any two dates (for example, 22 April 2022 and 24 April 2022):
$ git log --oneline --since&#x3D;&quot;2022-04-22&quot; --until&#x3D;&quot;2022-04-24&quot;
In this example, the output displays all the commits between 22 April 2022 and 24 April 2022, which excludes the commits done on 22 April 2022. If you want to include the commits done on 22 April 2022, replace 2022-04-22 with 2022-04-21.
Run the following command to display commits between any two dates by a specific author only (for example, Agil):
$ git log --oneline --since&#x3D;&quot;2022-04-22&quot; \
--until&#x3D;&quot;2022-04-24&quot; --author&#x3D;&quot;Agil&quot;

Reporting
Git has many advantages, and one of them is the way it enables you to gather data about your project. The git log command is an important reporting tool and yet another reason to use Git!

为何是阅读器
大学毕业后，我告别了拥有海量藏书的图书馆，开始了漫长的阅读工具体验之旅。
起初，惯性思维让我从当当、京东等大平台买书来读。我喜欢撕掉新书塑封时的期待心情，也慢慢攒起来了自己的第一批库存。新书的开销几乎成为刚毕业的我除吃饭和租房外的第三大支出项。
后来，多抓鱼开始了他们的创业，我也成为了他们的最早一批用户。我在他们的小程序上养成了买二手书的习惯，也尝试着卖掉了一些看完的书。我喜欢这种循环与分享的理念，有时收到他人批注过的书页，时有共鸣，像是在和一名未曾谋面的老友会心一笑。
然而北漂不易，在这样试运行了快三年后，寸土寸金的租房空间已经难以下脚。再加上数次搬家几乎成了北漂的必修课，因此「纸质书」在我这里已经逐渐和「奢侈品」画了等号。我开始把目光转向电子书。
彼时「蜗牛阅读」早于「微信阅读」兴起，我用手机读完每天免费的一小时，眼睛已经感觉酸涩。后来我尝试了 iPad 版本，视觉的疲劳感依然没有好转。于是像每一个热爱阅读或者感觉自己热爱阅读的人一样，我下单了人生的第一台 Kindle，开始了我的阅读器泡面之旅。
Kindle 的小屏幕让我非常不适应。由于阅读惯性使然，为了尽可能获得和纸质书的一页近似的信息量，我需要把字体调整到很小，然而字体变小又让阅读本身变得吃力。加上 Kindle Unlimited 并不优质的资源和第三方网站的不稳定，我发现 Kindle 在我这里并没有代替纸质书的地位，反而是新鲜感过后，逐渐落入吃灰的境地。
再后来，得到 app 开始推出了电子书的业务，上线初期是 148元/年。我这个得到重度用户试用了…</span>

                              <span>引言
iPad中关于键盘的设置与鼠标一样 —— 非常混乱。例如，iPad键盘的设置也是出现在「通用 | 键盘」、「辅助功能 | 键盘」以及「辅助功能 | 触控 — 辅助触控」中。
其中，「辅助功能 | 触控 — 辅助触控」其实就是上一篇文章中的「鼠标键」，具体可以参考《鼠标搭配 iPadOS，如何设置才能更好用？》
「通用 | 键盘 — 实体键盘」
键位调节
在实体键盘中，你可以根据iPad已有的输入法进行键位调节。例如我们常用的是QWERTY键盘，而你可以在这里改成AZERTY等。

 
下面的几项设置中，大家基本都能理解，而且也无关痛痒。笔者认为比较重要的是下面两个：
按下🌐显示表情符号
首先，这个🌐符号在妙控键盘里就是左下角的fn。
显示表情符号这个按钮，比较适合常用emoji😄的场景。例如‼️，一般写小🍠的朋友都需要用较多的emoji来分1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣等小标题，那么打开这个功能就会非常方便啦✨。
实际上，就算打开了这个功能，也不会影响我们切换输入法，因为使用control+空格也能轻松切换输入法，与我们使用Mac的习惯一样。

使用大写锁定键切换语言
第二个功能也是Mac中特有的功能。从Windows换到Mac的用户很不爽的一点是：想按Caplock键来输入大写字母，结果只能切换输入法，非得长按才行。
实际上这个功能是可以开关的，iPad上也一样。打开后，我们可以自由地在当前输入法和英文输入法之间切换（如果当前是简体中文输入法，那么就是中——英；如果是俄语输入法，那么便是俄——英），如果在键盘语言中把英文输入法删除的话，这个功能即使打开也不能使用了。关闭后，我们按下Caplock键就能切换为全大写输入。macOS中也一样，删除自带的中文输入法（英文输入法不能删除），就不能实现这个功能。

「辅助功能 | 键盘」

辅助功能中的键盘设置分为两个部分，一个是…</span>

                              <span>你好，我是马上要上第 700 节 CrossFit 团课的克莱尔。（但今天是我的休息日。所以我来写稿了。
如果你想减脂增肌，或者厌倦了在普通健身房对着满屋子器械不知从何下手，CrossFit 训练也许是一个最简单粗暴的健身方案。

融合有氧器械、哑铃壶铃、药球、奥林匹克举重与单杠和吊环体操动作， CrossFit 以社区感、团课、每天不重样的训练内容闻名。对，我们每天练的项目都不一样，它要求你什么都懂（一点），对心肺、力量、柔韧性等各方面都有要求。
换句话说， CrossFit 花样丰富，有趣，强度大，但作为一个相对小众的运动，准入门槛也不低。如果你在一二线城市，找到好馆子的可能性会比较大。如果你经常出差—— CrossFit 就像健身界的星巴克，无论到哪个城市，都能找到以相似模式运行的 Box ，能结识不同的朋友。
全球 CF 馆分布
今年是我练 CF 的第三年。根据三年的观察，许多来 CF 新客体验的人常被这项运动的强度或者“对新人不友好”震慑，觉得这是一馆子又壮又爱拼命的疯子。但其实 CF 并没有想象中这么吓人。在进行你的第一次 CF 训练之前，提前知道这些事情可以降低你在馆里低血糖、呕吐或者被吓得从此听到 CF 就绕道走的概率。
离你最近的 CrossFit 训练馆在哪里？
首先，如何找到离你最近的 CF 训练馆？如果你在国内一线城市，在点评 app 里输入 CrossFit 就是最快的方法，如果搜索结果中出现【综合训练】字样，它很有可能也是一个 CF 馆。只是未经 CF 官方认证。这不代表它是山寨——近几年有越来越多场馆认为自己不需要每年缴会费做这个认证，但大家训练的系统是一样的。
如果你在国外，除了谷歌，另一个方法是点进 crossfit.com 网页，在右上角 Find a gym 这里找到经过官方认证的场馆（对国内场馆同样适用，但也许网速会众所周知地慢一点）…</span>

                              <span>写在前面
这个标题其实已经被我修改了一下，因为一边上学一边写稿偶尔真的拖延爆炸。在这之前，其实标题是：“灵动岛到底好不好”。如今我也算是吃了豹子胆，敢直接标题下结论。虽然已经离发布会过了很多天，当时的情绪也已经逐渐稀释，还是想尽可能理性的去一点点解释，为什么不好。
我并不想在文章的一开头就给自己贴上标签，一方面是不喜欢这样的做法，另一方面也是此时的我并没有什么拿得出手的名堂。很多观点都是超级主观的，但也很高兴你能来看看！谢谢你，我的朋友！希望你看的开心！

“好不好”的尺度
对于灵动岛，我感觉我们都有着一样的一条曲折心路：发布会前被剧透难看的感叹号挖孔，发布会时被灵动岛的亮相视频惊艳到再次对苹果重拾希望，但第二天起床琢磨过劲——这也是我们出现分歧的地方：我们都想知道这究竟是另一个 Touch Bar，还是一个能定义 iPhone 接下来几年发展的新设计。
要想搞清楚这个问题，我想讲个有些偏题的故事。
来到伦敦后，一个人住一个只有17平米的房子，空虚寂寞冷的时候也会想用音乐填满自己的房间。于是就在亚马逊上看了看各种音箱。我目前使用的电脑是14寸的 MacBook Pro，但长期会连着一个明基的显示器来用，所以我对这个音箱购买就列下了几条条件：

音质不能比 mac 本身差
必须有 aux，这样我能连接显示器用，受不了蓝牙的音画不同步
能放在显示器的正下方，所以不能太大
好看，别太贵…

在网上看了一圈，我特别喜欢 Marshall 的 EMBERTON II，当时加上一点学生优惠不到100英镑就能拿下。我觉得它小巧精致，光是凭借这好看的皮囊我就快按耐不住自己的购买欲了。可是它却有一个地方不能满足我的需求，它没有 aux，纯蓝牙。当时我的内心就出现了两股力量：一股力量准备 pua 自己，让自己接受蓝牙的延迟；另一股力量开始嘲讽 Marshall 这个品牌的一些关于“音质”和“品…</span>

实话实说，最近软件圈的「玩具」有点儿多。
笔记软件，有 Tana；浏览器，有 Arc；Readwise 新出的一站式阅读器 Reader ，也很不错。
没想到，我又在 Jarod 的知识星球里看到他推荐了一款在线编辑器：LEX。
要来了一个邀请链接后，原本我是打算先留着，有空再仔细尝试。但是，一进入 LEX 的界面，读了官方的介绍，我立刻就不淡定了。

其实，哪里只是我一个人不淡定啊？
Building the Second Brain 作者 Tiago Forte 说，自己已经看到要失业的迹象了。原来，在他用 LEX 试写的一篇文章里，他自己只写了 5 个词儿。
剩下全是 AI 顺着往下编。

至于效率类 YouTube 播主 Ali Abdaal 更是「恶作剧」：他用 LEX 创作了一篇「15 个效率技巧」，拆成一串推文发了出来，结果成了自己反响最热烈的推文。（事后他向大家公开了内容来源。）

当然，Ali 是名人，浏览量是有名人效应的。即使如此，人工智能的作品几乎骗过了所有人的眼睛，还收获了这么多的点赞和转发，这就厉害了。
下面说说我自己的实际测试结果吧。下图中，只有红框里面的文字，是我写的。然后后面的段落，全都是 LEX 自动补全的。

更厉害的是，根据这些内容，LEX 自动生成了若干标题，我只是从中选了一个而已。

LEX 基于风头正劲的 AI 文本生成引擎 GPT-3。其实，原本 GPT-2 时代，人工智能自动补全已经大显神通了。GPT-3 的应用，意味着写出来的东西更真假难辨。

                              <span>近几年区块链逐渐火热以后，「去中心化」的概念逐渐受到关注。
去中心化指的是：在一个分布有众多节点的系统中，每个节点都具有高度自治的特征。
回想一下，你的各种私有资料都储存在哪里？
文档都在 WPS 的云盘，或者散落在各种文件夹中；
音频文件可能分散在网易云音乐、QQ 音乐、酷狗等等音频平台，如果你喜欢音乐的本地化，也许会下载到某个文件夹中；
至于相片这种更为私人的东西，则有可能在手机本地相册或者选择百度网盘、iCloud 等等网络云盘中。
我们经常会把同类的文件分散在各处，当我们想去寻找的时候却往往难以在一个确定的地方查询；又或者遭遇到了平台倒闭，难以取回储存在云空间中的珍贵资料。
所以对于文件的「中心化」储存和管理，是一个值得尝试的文件管理形式。
我认为其中有三个核心：集中管理、本地优先、在线引用
将「中心化」概念运用到相册管理中
比如图片的管理，拿我的个人相册举例。
我们的手机每天都会有很多图片产生：屏幕截图、自拍、风景等等照片，但并非所有的照片都值得长期保存，所以要定期清理无关照片，备份重要的相片。

我从大学时期就开始使用谷歌相册管理我的手机相片，这个堪称当下功能最强大的在线相册，会智能地自动备份相机拍下的所有照片、屏幕截图，甚至还有其他 APP 中保存的图片。同时也可以一键清理本地已备份的图片，节省手机空间。
五年多过去了，我的谷歌相册中积攒了无数张相片，其中超过一半以上的图片都是无关的废片，混杂在各种较为重要的照片中，我花了很长时间都难以删除这些图片。
于是我国庆期间我批量下载了所有的相片，大约 5w 张，其中绝大部分图片都是各种被自动备份的无关照片，经过大约三天的筛选，最终保留下了差不多 7000 多张照片。
那么问题来了，如何让我的相册不再受到污染，能够自动备份到谷歌相册中，而且我希望能够保留一份相册在本地，在我删除本地照片的时候自动在云端也删除。
我采取的…</span>

                              <span>2022国庆七天，秋高气爽良辰美景怎可辜负？驾驶着 Model 3，带上小米 11 Ultra，一路向西北从惠州到桂林。

Model 3 标续版提车于2021 年 12 月，表显续航 423 公里，1.6 万公里后表显降为 418 公里。
去程全长 627 公里，途径佛山百利达广场特斯拉超充站充电一次约 15 分钟，在贺州境内高速上充电一次约 25 分钟。
佛山百利达广场特斯拉超充站选址非常好，就在高速出入口附近，上下高速很方便。贺州境内高速上的快充表现不错，功率一度飙到充电 800 km/h 以上。

提车至今对 Model 3 的续航表现基本满意，天气凉爽的情况下表显多少就能跑出多少，甚至有时候实际续航还会超出表显，不同天气状况下的真实续航表现可以看我的 B 站自驾游视频。
晚霞迎接我们一路向西
到达桂林市临桂区已是晚上 10 点 15 分左右，办好入住第一件事就是去吃一碗桂林米粉。可能因为去的是商业步行街，美食比较商业化，即使当时比较饿了，这碗粉也没有给我带来美味的感觉。

重头戏在第二天的龙脊梯田之旅。龙脊梯田位于桂林龙胜县东南部和平乡境内的龙脊山。龙脊梯田距龙胜县城27公里，距桂林市80公里，景区面积共66平方公里，梯田分布在海拔300至1100米之间，坡度大多在26至35度之间，最大坡度达50度。
从临桂区去龙脊梯田景区大门口要一个半小时左右，桂林真大啊，查了下比北京还要大 1 万多平方公里
根据疫情防控要求，散客只能在景区收费处外面的广场购票，票价 80 元/成年人，和售票处价格一致。
工作人员告知我们，双向单车道的蜿蜒的山路加上堵车，从景区售票处到龙脊梯田里的几个寨子还要差不多 1 个小时的车程。国庆期间人特别多，如果按常规路线开车去名气最大的大寨，开车到坐缆车的地方要 1 个多小时，排队花钱坐缆车还要1个多小时，工作人员收费给我们指明了一条别的路去千层天梯，美景不打折，还可以开车到达。

工作人员收费指明的这条路应该是尚未完全开发的新路，路上看到了多处没有做固化工程的山坡，不少路段有落石和滑坡泥土，还有一个地方路面塌方，行驶起来要格外小心。
使用长焦拍下这张照片，脑海里突然响起《断背山》的配乐，给人一种氛围宁静的感觉
一个多小时后终于达到千层天梯，话不多说欣赏美景吧，看看小米 11 Ultra 记录的龙脊梯田，先来一张全景图。

这张全景图是在千层天梯处拍的，当天天空中飘着淡青蓝色的烟雾，有一种烟雨朦胧的感觉，阳光洒在稻田上勾勒出明暗的分界线，小米 11 Ultra 非常好地还原了真实的色彩和光影。
当时在梯田附近一家民宿停车吃饭，两荤一素一共三个菜（牛蛙+鱼+青菜+米饭）加免费停车 120 元左右，坐在民宿楼下的台阶上吃饭吹风欣赏美景十分惬意，可以说物超所值。

使用小米 11 Ultra 以来最满意的就是它的长焦表现，镜头压缩空间集中表达内容可以拍出非常有故事感的照片。以下照片应该都是 5x-30x 范围内拍摄的（具体记不清了），画质表现超出预期，当天的良好光线也功不可没。
 后期调色套了滤镜
11 Ultra 的主摄表现不错，成片有光影层次，色彩过渡自然，数码味和锐化较少，和肉眼所见十分接近。

当然，小米 11 Ultra 拍照也不是十全十美的，成像慢、多颗摄像头切换动画生硬、逆光自拍效果一般、超级夜景容易糊等等。不过考虑到 3699 元的价格，这些问题也都可以忽略了。
最后附上一些桂林游玩期间的美图（部分有后期），推荐大家去桂林玩，一座现代和古典，先锋流行和土著闲适相结合的奇妙城市，当地人比较友善，这次去也没遇到宰客行为，花费物超所值，值得一去。</span>

                              <span>灵动岛是今年iPhone的热点更新。我们在早期的时候，看到了很多针对灵动岛的玩法，比如在岛的周围养宠物、用灵动岛打游戏、适配灵动岛的挖孔壁纸等。
但是，这些玩法从系统和功能层面，并没有用到真正的“灵动岛接口”。在苹果开发者文档中，灵动岛实际上是一种“实时活动”。在某些用户需要实时关注状态变化的场景下，为用户展示信息。比如实时更新比赛数据、实时更新外卖进度、实时更新计时器、实时更新地图导航指引等等。
如果iPhone安装了iOS 16.1系统，在iPhone 14 Pro机型上，实时活动可以在灵动岛和锁屏界面展示；而在非iPhone 14 Pro机型，则只在锁屏界面展示。

OneWidget如何定位灵动岛？
仔细阅读苹果开发者文档之后，我们发现实时活动的实现方式和小组件有非常多重叠的地方。同时，不管在锁屏界面还是“展开的”灵动岛位置，它的尺寸都很像中尺寸的桌面小组件。再者，实时活动不能够交互、也不能有动画、不能随时刷新，这些和小组件都太像了。所以，我们最终把实时活动定位成“一种特殊的小组件”。
当我们把“灵动岛”定义为“实时展示的小组件”，那么一切就更简单了，原则上小组件能够实现的它都可以实现。只是我们需要额外思考，在锁屏和灵动岛这两个特殊的位置，用户凭什么要展开来用它。
OneWidget怎么做灵动岛功能？
在迭代产品的2年多时间里，OneWidget的各种类型的小组件从用户那里得到了很多不错的回馈。当我们复盘这些小组件，用户最关心的是三个关键词：实用、美观、趣味。所以，设计灵动岛这个特殊的小组件，我们应该做的也是实用、美观、趣味。另外补充一点，对于很多用户来说，美观、趣味也是一种实用价值，美观带来个性化的装饰、趣味带来功能的尝鲜探索。
从实用和便捷角度，我们设计了“启动之岛”和“健康之岛”。
从美观和趣味角度，我们设计了“宠物之岛”和“摆烂之岛”。

如何开启灵动岛？
如果iPhone更新到iOS 16.1以上，下载OneWidget 的3.6.0以上的版本之后，可以进入个人中心找到主入口。在灵动岛配置页面，选择需要开启的“岛屿”，当App进入后台或者切换到其他App，实时活动就已经开启在了锁屏界面和灵动岛区域。
配置入口我们还单独设计了一些细节：会动的海平面、开启后的彩色提示框、预览效果等。

宠物之岛
用户可以在“宠物之岛”领养一个自己的电子宠物，它每天陪你玩、会饿、会困、会渴，在不同的状态下用户需要点击不同的操作。我们给宠物取了一个名字叫做“岛岛”，领养之后，在App内还会显示领养的天数。岛岛除了不同的状态，也有可能会出去玩耍，只有等他回来才能再次跟他互动。为了满足个性化，宠物“岛岛”还允许自定义颜色，现在我们支持了7种颜色的切换。

启动之岛
“启动之岛”可以允许用户添加快速启动App或者小程序的入口，常驻在锁屏界面和灵动岛里，展开之后即可点击一键直达的App。用户可以添加1~6的常用启动入口，根据添加的数量变化，图标和间距会自动调整来适应合适的布局。和锁屏小组件、桌面小组件一行，这里的启动器入口支持添加常用的App、微信支付宝的二级路径、微信和支付宝的小程序入口。

摆烂之岛
“摆烂之岛”将随机展示一些“反鸡汤”的插画和文案。这个功能为了满足“趣味性”，该卷的时候卷，该躺的时候也要好好躺。偶尔摆烂无可厚非，休息是人之常情。

健康之岛
“健康之岛”实时展示用户当天的健康数据，比如步数、运动时间、消耗能量、身高、体重等。尤其是对于每日会更新变动的数据，是可以查看更新数据的（不过目前系统刷新问题，会有较多延迟）。

 
以上就是OneWidget关于灵动岛功能的思考和功能的介绍。希望帮助大家了解灵动岛，也能够帮助大家通过这些小功能体验到灵动岛（实时活动）的用法。我们将继续做好一个“装修产品”，带来更多实用、美观、有趣的功能。

                              <span>Hi 大家好呀！我叫 Ask Term 。这是我来少数派写的教程系列文章的第一篇，给大家带来一个开源知识库 Memos 的部署教程，小伙伴们也许会问 Memos 什么？那么我就把官方对 Memos 的定义引用一下：

An open source, self-hosted knowledge base that works with a SQLite db file.

如何还是不太清楚这个是干嘛用的，那么体验一下官方的 Demo，体验过的小伙伴一定会觉得这不就是 Flomo 吗？确实，这算是非官方 Flomo 的开源替代品，鉴于 Memos 的开源特性你可以随意的部署在自己的服务器上去使用。
Memos 的部署也很简单，一条 Docker 命令就能启动，但是对于不熟悉 Docker 的小伙伴或许还是有些难度的，为此我写了这篇入门级的教程，让小伙伴能够轻松完成 Memos 的部署。
