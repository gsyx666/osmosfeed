HMD is announcing a trio of new smartphones today — the Nokia G60 5G, C31, and X30 5G — and says the X30 5G is the “most eco-friendly smartphone” it’s ever produced. The three phones are focused on Europe, and are distinct from the range of devices that HMD sells in the US. 
As well as being sold outright, the Nokia X30 5G will be one of a handful of phones available via HMD’s new subscription service called “Circular,” where customers can subscribe to get a handset for a monthly fee and receive incentives to use a phone for as long as possible. Circular will initially be available in the UK and Germany, but HMD says it’s planning a global launch “in the coming months.” 
HMD justifies its eco-friendly claims about the Nokia X30 5G with...

Disney is exploring a membership program in the style of Amazon Prime, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The program could offer various exclusive perks, discounts, and other enticements for 	subscribers to spend more money on Disney products and services. A secondary benefit would be allowing the company to collect more information on customers’ tastes and habits, improving its ability to cross-sell across its various businesses — from streaming services to theme parks to merchandise. 
According to the WSJ, discussion of the membership program is very much in its early stages. It’s not clear what segments of Disney’s audience it would target, how much it would cost, or when the program might launch. Internally, some...

After years as an Apple-only smart home company, Eve is finally turning to the dark other side and launching an Android app. At the IFA tech show, the company announced that its suite of smart home products – which include smart plugs, smart light strips, smart switches, and smart sensors – will get their own Android app in late 2022. Most Eve products will also become compatible with other smart home systems, including Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings. 
This giant shift (which we did see coming at CES, but still, we’ll have to see it to believe it) is largely down to the upcoming smart home standard Matter. Matter’s primary raison d’etre is to make more devices work with more platforms, removing the confusion and...

Smart door locks and video doorbells are great conveniences for those who live in single-family homes, but what about the millions of people who live in flats, apartments, and condos? They might also like to answer their front door from their phone — whether they’re home or not — and perhaps buzz their visitor in without getting off the couch or rushing home from the office. Ring, maker of the original video doorbell, thinks it has a solution.
Ring Intercom is a DIY, retrofit device that attaches to the intercom inside your home and connects via Wi-Fi to the Ring app on your smartphone. It’s specifically designed for European apartment buildings where multiple flats (or apartments) have one entry point and only an audio intercom system...

It’s official, Philips Hue’s gorgeous Lightguide bulbs are real. Signify, which owns Philips Hue, announced the new white and color ambiance light bulbs at the IFA tech conference in Berlin this week, confirming The Verge’s earlier report of the imminent arrival of the oversized dimmable smart bulbs designed for open lighting fixtures.
Other new products incoming to Hue’s smart lighting line include a Hue Play Gradient Lightstrip for PCs, a slimmer downlight for low-profile ceilings, and a tunable white filament candle bulb. Signify also announced a partnership with Samsung SmartThings to sync music with your smart lights, and new features for its Hue app, including the ability to set automatic away lighting — which Hue is calling “Mimic...

Signify is making further inroads with the gaming community with its new lineup of Philips Hue Play gradient lightstrips for PCs. Much like the 55-inch Play lightstrip explicitly made for TVs, the PC versions of the Play lightstrips provide flexible accent lighting that attaches to the back of your monitor. 
The lightstrips will be available in bundles sized for displays ranging from 24 to 27 inches ($169.99) or 32 to 34 inches ($189.99) and an additional bundle that supports a trio of 24 to 27-inch monitors ($279.99). The new family of Play lightstrips can sync with other connected lighting in the Philips Hue ecosystem and will be available starting September 13th.

Sony is renewing its “compact” phone for another season with the announcement of the Xperia 5 IV. It’s a step down from the 1 IV in size, price, and features but shares the same emphasis on parity across its camera system. That means all three of the phone’s rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — include the company’s excellent Real-time Eye AF for better portraits and are capable of super-fast burst shooting speeds even with HDR enabled. It has other flagship specs to back up its camera features, too, and comes with an equally flagship-y price: $999.
The Xperia 5 IV (side note: what are they going to call next year’s phone? The 5 V?) includes a 24mm-equivalent standard wide, 16mm-equiv ultrawide, and 60mm-equiv...

Kobo’s announced its first fully waterproof six-inch e-reader, the Kobo Clara 2E, will be available on September 22nd. However, you can preorder it now from Kobo for $129.99.
Kobo says the new e-reader is also the Rakuten-owned company’s first built from over 85 percent recycled plastic, with ocean plastic accounting for 10 percent of that. These changes are a part of Kobo’s goal to offset 100 percent of the carbon emissions related to shipping its e-readers to customers. Made from FSC-certified recycled paper and printed with soy ink, its magnet-free packaging is also supposed to be more eco-friendly. 
On the features front, the new e-reader also differs from its predecessor, the Clara HD, in that it supports Bluetooth so you can listen...

                              <span>It’s just another ThinkPad...or is it?
    

  
I reviewed Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Fold, the first PC with a foldable screen, in late 2020. At the time, it was a very cool idea, but not particularly, shall we say, usable. Today, Lenovo has announced its second go at this, the “Next-generation” ThinkPad X1 Fold. I spent a few minutes with the device, and let me tell you: I am much more optimistic about this one. 
Much of this new X1 Fold will be familiar to fans not just of the previous X1 Fold, but of the ThinkPad line in general. The device is outfitted with the series’s standard black and red color scheme, with the staple ThinkPad X1 logo on the lid. There’s a ThinkPad-style keyboard with a trackpoint and inverted-T arrow keys. It’s well-built, sturdy, and sleek. 
But some changes have...

                              <span>Today, I was trying to gracefully shutdown my gin server and start it again through the application itself, without re-running my application.
Running a server, using gin.Run() or http.ListenAndServe(), will block goroutine, if it&#x27;s in the main process, so it will block the main goroutine:
func main() {
  ginApp :&#x3D; gin.Default()
  ginApp.Run(&quot;:80&quot;) // This code is blocking
  // next lines will never run because of blocking code.
  FuncForStoppingGinServer() // This function can&#x27;t be used.
}

We can simply block another goroutine and help main goroutine to remain free.
func main() {
  ginApp :&#x3D; gin.Default()
  go ginApp.Run(&quot;:80&quot;) // This code is not blocking anymore.
  FuncForStoppingGinServer() // This function will run now.
}

But, what should we do inside FuncForStoppingGinServer()??
No…</span>

                              <span>Do you love Typescript ?
Nest JS ?
Next JS ?
Prisma ?
Sometimes we need to work with all of this in a full stack application. But we always configure and build our frontend and backend separately. Then we connect the using APIs. 
But it&#x27;s hard to configure Nest and Next JS together since it takes time. 
What if I told you that I made a boiler plate configured with Typescript, Nest JS, Prisma and Next JS together. We don&#x27;t have to start our client and server separately and we don&#x27;t have to worry about the build process. It&#x27;s only a single command :
yarn start:dev
# or
yarn start

I faced an issue like this in the last week and I surfed through the GitHub all the way which ended up finding nothing useful. Well I love these frameworks and was trying to configure Nestand Nexttogether reading different articles those I found at some corners of the internet.
Finally I completed the boiler plate and named it TNPN (Typescript, Nest JS, Prisma, Next JS). I found it helpful for many projects where I don&#x27;t want to configure everything from scratch. 
Here is the GitHub repo link : TNPN
Hope you find this helpful. Don&#x27;t forget to leave your comments and contribute to the project if you wish.</span>

                              <span>Add Custom Image Size in WordPress. By default, WordPress automatically produces many models of image uploads in diverse sizes. Additionally, WordPress themes and plugins can also produce their own image size.
In this article, you will learn how to easily create custom image sizes in WordPress and use them on your website.
By default, each WordPress installation appears with three custom image sizes.
Thumbnail – 150*150
Medium– 300*300
Large – 1024*1024
This indicates that when you upload an image to your website, the kernel will automatically generate models in those sizes. However, sometimes these dimensions are not the ones you want for your website.

The Spinning Web Page - Prank 1
Wait, what is happening to my laptop, everything is spinning! I can&#x27;t do anything, what shall I do, who is behind this?
That will be exactly what your victim would be thinking when you are done with them.
Step 1:
 When they are not paying attention, sneak up to their laptop, open up their browser on any tab(if not already opened), right-click(on windows) or double …</span>

                              <span>I started the browser extension series to explore and learn more about how to set up different browser extensions.
I learned so much from all the articles in this series.
See all browser extension posts
As for now, I want to stop the beginner series for the extensions and see how people find it.
I&#x27;d love to hear from you if you learned something new and if you would like me to dive into a particular topic.
Also, let me know if you completely missed something in this series that you think I should try and cover.
In the series, we started looking at the type of browser extensions.
Let&#x27;s take a look at everything we covered to this point.
Plain browser extension
New tab extension
Adding TailwindCSS
Using React in browser extensions
Switching Parcel to Vite
Popup extension
External request in new tab extension
Popup weather extension
Browser notifications
Repeating notifications
Storage with browser extensions
Hooking into installs
Custom option page
Browser extension icon action
Popup page modifications
Extension messaging
Modify all images on a page
Creating turboReader
Publishing a extension
DevTools extension
I hope you all enjoyed this series, and please do let me know what type of browser extension articles you wish to see 💖.

  Amazon S3


Amazon S3 is an object storage service. It enables us to store virtually unlimited amounts of data. Data files are stored as objects. 
We place objects in a bucket. Every S3 bucket name must be globally unique across Regions (unique across all AWS customer accounts). 
The objects we store can vary in size from 0 bytes to 5 TB. Though individual objects cannot be larger than 5 TB, we can store as much total data as we need.
Object values are immutable, which means that after we upload an object, we cannot modify the value. If we want to modify the object, we must make a change outside of Amazon S3 and then re-upload the object. 
Objects also include metadata, which is a set of name-value pairs we can use to store information about …</span>

                              <span>Hi, I am Francesco, and I share daily content about Web3 (mainly on Twitter and YouTube)
In this article, I will summarize the steps you can take in order to learn Web3.
 
When we want to start something new, we need some direction just to don&#x27;t get stuck at the very beginning. 
But we all are different and we have different ways of learning. 
This article is based on my very personal experience in learning Web3.
 
I don&#x27;t like Roadmaps! But reading at least one can help us to have an idea of what we are expecting and to check if we are missing something.
Don&#x27;t get a Roadmap as a bible to trust and to follow blindly 100%, but as a reminder if you are on the right track.
There are many roadmaps, and I am working on one. 
For now I feel recommending the following one:

The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that constitute the structure and content of a document on the web, e.g. of a website.
In layman&#x27;s terms, the DOM represents the structure of your website.
You can think of the Document Object Model as a logical tree.

Furthermore, each branch of the tree ends in a node. Each node can

In other words, each node can contain HTML elements that can be accessed programmatically. 
Interfaces allow programmatic access to the tree. With them, you can change the document’s structure, style, or content. Here are some examples:

                              <span>Usually, if you run into working with team, you might want to speed up a little on cloning the codes, and some of the steps required for your application.
For me, I do this:
Create .bin directory
.bin contained any bash scripts that needed for my team to use.
In this post, just a use case: 
First time cloning the repository, what need to be done next? I wrote the following code in .bin/install:
TLDR;
#!/usr/bin/env bash

[ ! -d vendor/ ] &amp;&amp; composer install

[ ! -f .env ] &amp;&amp; cp .env.example .env &amp;&amp; php artisan key:generate

[ ! -d node_modules/ ] &amp;&amp; npm install &amp;&amp; npm run build

[ ! -f todo.md ] &amp;&amp; touch todo.md

Above are the baseline, you may add as you see fit.
So each time the code get cloned, just run . .bin/install.
Just a small improvement of productivity. :)</span>

                              <span>使用这些开源工具来记笔记。


笔记是任何作者生活的一部分。我的大部分文章都是从笔记应用开始的，这对我来说通常是 Joplin。有大量适用于 Linux 的笔记应用，你可能使用的不是我最喜欢的应用。最近的一篇博客文章让我想起了其中的六个，所以我整理了一份我最喜欢的列表。

Joplin



Joplin 适用于 Linux、Windows、macOS、Android 和 iOS。我喜欢 Joplin，因为它会自动保存你添加的任何内容。笔记可以上传到 NextCloud、OwnCloud、Joplin Cloud，甚至是 OneDrive、Dropbox 或任何 WebDav 应用等闭源服务。Joplin 还支持加密。

以各种格式导出笔记也很容易。它带有八个不同的主题，可让你定制其外观。

Joplin 采用 MIT 许可证。最初于 2017 年发布，Joplin 正在与大量贡献者社区一起持续开发。

Xournal



Xournal 适用于 Linux、Windows、macOS 和 Android。它的目的是让你创建包含几乎任何你可以想象的媒体类型的笔记。它支持压敏手写笔和绘图板，因此你可以创建 涂鸦笔记。你可以在里面打字、绘制简单的矢量、导入图形、录制音频等等。你还可以使用 Xournal 来注释 PDF，这就是我使用它的方式。它以 GPLv2 许可证发布，你可以以多种格式导出笔记。

Trillium



Trillium 是一个层级笔记应用，专注于知识构建库。它具有丰富的所见即所得编辑功能，支持表格、图像和 Markdown。它支持使用语法高亮编辑源代码中的注释。它是在 AGPL 许可证下发布的。

Trilium 可用作 Linux 和 Windows 的桌面应用，以及你可以在自己的 Linux 服务器上托管的 Web 应用。

Gnote



Gnote 是一个为 Linux 编写的开源笔记应用。它是由 Hubert Figuière 从一个名为 Tomboy 的项目中克隆出来的。与 Tomboy 一样，Gnote 使用类似 Wiki 的链接系统来允许你将笔记链接在一起。

GNote 的源代码可在 GitLab 上找到。该软件是 GPLv3 许可。

CherryTree



CherryTree 支持层级笔记。在 CherryTree 中，所有东西都是一个节点。节点可以是纯文本、富文本、各种编程语言的语法高亮。每个节点可以有子节点，每个子节点有不同的格式。

CherryTree 具有富文本和语法高亮的特点，并可以将数据存储在一个 XML 或 SQLite 文件中。CherryTree 可以从各种格式导入，包括 Markdown、HTML、纯文本、Gnote、Tomboy 和其他格式。它可以将文件导出为 PDF、HTML、纯文本和它自己的 CherryTree 格式。

CherryTree 使用 GPLv3 许可，可以安装在 Linux、Windows 和 macOS 上。

                              <span>Apache OpenOffice 下载量超过 3.33 亿次，主要是 Windows 用户

虽然 Apache OpenOffice 开源办公套件的发展几乎停滞不前，而 LibreOffice 一直在提供更现代的特性和功能，有趣的是，人们仍然在继续下载和使用 OpenOffice。Apache 软件基金会在周二宣布，自从他们在 2011 年接管这个开源办公套件以来，现在已经有超过 3.33 亿次下载。有些讽刺的是，根据公开的数字显示，Windows 用户的下载量为 2.97 亿，macOS 用户的下载量为 3100 万，而 Linux 用户的下载量仅为 470 万。另外，在 2020 年他们庆祝下载了 3 亿次。也就是说前 10 年平均每年有 3000 万次，而最近两年平均 1600 万次。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：Linux 用户数很少的一个原因是，几乎所有桌面 Linux 都预装的是 LibreOffice 而不是 OpenOfficce。这算不算唯一的 Windows 用户远超 Linux 用户的大型开源软件？另外，作为一个参考，2018 年，LibreOffice 说他们有 2 亿活跃用户，下载量理论上更多。




QEMU 7.1 发布，支持 LoongArch 64 位架构

QEMU 7.1 在开源 Linux 虚拟化堆栈中发挥着重要作用。在最新的版本中，提供了对 LoongArch 64 位架构的初步支持，目标是为了匹配 Loongson 3A5000 SoC 和 Loongson 7A1000 主机桥。此版本还增加了对 RISC-V 1.12 特权规格的支持。支持 Linux 上的 QEMU 的零拷贝发送，以减少虚拟机迁移时对源主机的 CPU 占用。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：QEMU 对龙芯的支持意义重大，虽然我对龙芯对 RISC-V 的批评不以为然，但是看到龙芯的发展还是应该点个赞。




恶意应用伪装成谷歌翻译桌面应用来挖矿

尽管谷歌翻译从未推出过桌面版，但是用户搜索就可能会在结果页面看到一些免费软件网站提供下载。IT 安全组织 CPR 发布了一份报告，称其发现了隐藏在看起来合法的应用程序背后的加密挖掘恶意软件活动。这些欺诈程序包括桌面版的谷歌翻译、Yandex 翻译、微软翻译、YouTube Music 等等。

                              <span>Debian 终于开始考虑将非自由固件纳入一般决议中了。那么，将会如何呢？




由于其稳定性和新功能之间的平衡的做法，Debian 是最受欢迎的 Linux 发行版之一。

但是，它并没有配备任何非自由固件。

对于想在新硬件上使用 Debian 的用户来说，这已经成为一个问题。

大多数最新的设备和配置都需要非自由固件来使其工作，这包括 Wi-Fi、图形显示等等。

为了解决这个问题，前 Debian 项目负责人、开发者 Steve McIntyre 已经对此积极讨论了一段时间。最近在 DebConf 22 会议上，正如 Geeker&#x27;s Digest 所发现的那样，Steve 谈到了修复固件的混乱局面，更好地向用户和开发者表明了这一点。

现在社区中讨论的进展是，看起来 Debian 已经启动了一项一般决议，让其利益相关者投票决定如何处理非自由固件的问题。

Debian 的一般决议提案

这个一般决议案有四个提案（LCTT 译注：原文和官方提案说明不够清晰，我根据理解重新梳理了）：


提案 A：改变原有的官方镜像集（安装镜像和实况镜像），Debian 将在官方镜像中包含非自由固件包。包含的固件将在检测到需求时默认启用。然而，它也将包括让用户在启动时禁用的方法。（截止本文发表时的提案支持人数：17）

提案 B：不改变原有的镜像集，保留原来的不包含非自由固件的镜像，另外单独提供包含非自由固件的官方镜像。新的镜像下载链接将更醒目以方便新用户找到它们，而原来的镜像的视觉优先级将变低。（截止本文发表时的提案支持人数：10）

提案 C：和提案 B 类似，在用户下载不包含自由固件的镜像时，提醒他们还有包含非自由固件的镜像可供下载。（截止本文发表时的提案支持人数：6）

提案 D：继续遵守《Debian 社会契约Debian Social Contract》第 1 节和第 5 节的精神，继续保持现状，不在 Debian 中包含任何非自由软件，但支持它们的使用，并欢迎其他人分发这样的作品。（截止本文发表时的提案支持人数：6）


这些是一些有趣的建议。我认为提案 A 对所有人都很方便，同时给高级用户禁用非自由固件的机会。

你可以在 官方网页 中了解更多关于一般决议的信息。

你怎么看？

将非自由固件纳入官方发行版中

至于目前的情况，你可以找到带有非自由固件的“非官方”的 Debian 镜像。

然而，并不是每个用户都知道它，即使它在 Debian 的下载页面上被宣传，“非官方”的说法也不会让用户比推荐的镜像更喜欢。

此外，当用户可以选择任何基于 Ubuntu 的发行版或 Ubuntu 作为替代品时，期望他们安装非自由固件是违反直觉的。

不仅仅限于这些问题，Steve 在他的 博客 中还提到了其他一些问题，包括：


维护独立的非自由镜像是很耗时的。

由于缺乏非自由固件，许多用户不喜欢官方镜像。


那么，你认为 Debian 的一般决议的投票结果是什么？一个单独的介质镜像？还是把它包括在官方镜像中？

@rubber9soul：给iPod找个家

购买渠道：咸鱼二手
购买价格：500元

最近迷恋从二手平台淘一些音频设备，这些「老家伙」使用起来不像现在的很多设备那样便利，但是声音上还是非常讲究的。
因为手里还留了几部 iPod，一直想买一个 Dock 音箱让它们继续发光发热，看了一圈之后锁定了 Bose SoundDock II。

在 iPod 鼎盛的时期，很多厂商会专门推出 Dock 音箱，其中 Bose 也非常积极，先后推出了很多代产品。Bose SoundDock II 最早发布于 2008 年，到现在已经十四年「高龄」了。它使用的是 30pin 接口，也是 Bose 最后一代兼容这个接口的 Dock 音箱（之后换为Lightning）。
SoundDock II 的声音也是Bose典型的调音风格，声音浑厚注重氛围感；因为两个全频喇叭有一定的横向间距，所以还能听出一些立体声效果。可能是最近听了太多智能音箱的缘故，听到SoundDock II 后突然有一种「这样才对嘛」的感觉哈哈。
我找了几款同价位的智能音箱对比下，大家可以听下声音风格的不同（可能有点不太公平，毕竟Bose当年也卖一千多，大家听个乐吧）：
 
和一代 SoundDock 相比，SoundDock II 还支持 3.5mm 音频输入，我之前买的一个 AirPort Express（A1264） 就派上用场了。

AirPort Express是苹果已经停产的路由器，它长得就像是一个MacBook电源，除了基础的网络功…</span>

大家好，我是 StaySleep 的作者八层夹心奥利奥。
今年八月份，我在 App Store 上线了我的第一款 app，StaySleep。在发布之初的前三天，它一度登上了 App Store 健康健美分区的 Top 100，那几天我的社交平台也被如潮水一般的反馈、建议给淹没了，而在上周四，我惊喜地发现我的 app 出现在了 App Store 的每周编辑推荐位。趁着八月底暑假的最后几天，我想在少数派和各位朋友聊一聊 StaySleep 与我的故事。
当时看到这个排名的时候感觉太激动了
在想出这个「点子」之前，我都经历了什么？
「熬夜」，在熬与不熬中煎熬
或许是从上大学以后开始，我的入睡时间变得越来越晚，在有了手机这个连接世界的桥梁后，我似乎每时每刻都想着关注当前大家正在议论和关注的事情，哪怕是深夜。在高中那会我还没有那么多电子产品，所以最多的消遣活动就是睡前和室友们唠唠嗑，看看书架上翻过好几遍的鸡汤励志文学，很快也能感到困意然后安然睡去。而现在的晚上，即使我早早的就躺在床上希望自己可以尽快入睡，但翻来覆去以后还是忍不住再拿起手机，刷会短视频、刷会朋友圈，而时间一晃可能就是一个多小时。看着手机始终上时针的数字逐渐增大，我才明白，真的不能再看手机了，这时才恋恋不舍地放下手机，匆匆入梦。
熬夜的危害有很多，熬夜玩手机的危害更甚。手机的灯光会减少体内让我们感觉到困意的褪黑素的生成，手机里每时每刻变化的内容也不断刺激着我们产生更多的多巴胺，让我们更加兴奋。虽然偶尔我也会因为学业或者工作不得不熬夜，但是每次熬完夜第二天起床的感觉，就像是前…</span>

Amazing though it may seem, we each experience the world differently. That&#x27;s one reality with over 6 billion interpretations. Many of us use computers to broaden our experience of the world, but a computer is part of reality and so if you experience reality without, for instance, vision or sound, then you also experience a computer without vision or sound (or whatever your unique experience might be.) As humans, we don&#x27;t quite have the power to experience the world the way somebody does. We can mimic some of the surface-level things (I can close my eyes to mimic blindness, for example) but it&#x27;s only an imitation, without history, context, or urgency. As a …</span>

Tracee is a project by Aqua Security for tracing processes at runtime. By tracing processes using Linux eBPF (Berkeley packet filter) technology, Tracee can correlate collected information and identify malicious behavioral patterns.
eBPF
BPF is a system to help in network traffic analysis. The later eBPF system extends classic BPF to improve the programmability of the Linux kernel in different areas, such as network filtering, function hooking, and so on. Thanks to its register-based virtual machine, which is embedded in the kernel, eBPF can execute programs written with a restricted C language without needing to recompile the kernel or load a mod…</span>

                              <span>Why buildd an SEO course?

We love SEO! It is one of the most reliable channels and has helped grow our websites to 1.5 million+ visits each month.

But, when we started buildd-ing our startup, we knew nothing about SEO. When we tried to learn SEO, we found complex jargons, frameworks and strategies.

After making tons of mistakes, we realized SEO is not just simple, it is VERY simple. It is just complicated by popular marketers.

So, we designed a course, to help even a 5-year old understand SEO and to actually help YOU actionably buildd YOUR startup. NOT for showing-off, but actual growth.

What do I get in this course?

Get ready to binge watch 2.5 hours of actionable learning content on SEO!

1. The entire course is broken into 11 modules, and each module has 2-5 chapters.
2. Most modules have actionable tutorials, with a step-by-step implementation of the strategy discussed.
3. Finally, to gain the most out of the course, ensure you execute along with watching or reading the content

So, go on and buildd your SEO expertise!

Cheers,
Karthik

                              <span>Ness Labs. Two years ago, I discovered Roam, and today couldn’t imagine managing my studies and my work without it.

Since then, there’s been a renaissance of Tools for Thought – apps to improve your productivity, your creativity and your thinking – but it’s become hard to decide which tool to use, and how to safely transfer your notes if you decide to switch between two tools.

That’s why I created Switchboard, the most comprehensive collection of tutorials for you to safely make the switch from a Tool for Thought to another! 🥳

Inside each Switchboard tutorial, you’ll find:

• Why you may want to switch to the new tool
• The reasons why you may be better off sticking to your current tool (shiny toy syndrome!)
• If you do decide to make the switch, how to safely export your notes from one tool to another
• Tips to quickly get used to your new Tool for Thought

Thanks to @anthilemoon for the support over the past few months while I was working on this project. We’ll keep on adding more tutorials, so let me know if there’s one you want us to create!

Canonical 的工程师正在开发 GameMode Snap。GameMode 是 Feral 的守护程序，能够在游戏启动时自动将 CPU 频率调节器设置为性能模式，并在退出游戏后将其恢复到先前的默认值。GameMode 已经支持在 Flatpak 容器化环境中运行，而现在他们正在将其过渡到 Snap。GameMode 作为一个 Debian 软件包在 Ubuntu 上已经有一段时间了，甚至是默认安装的。

老王点评：Canonical 正在孜孜不倦的将各种重要应用切换到 Snap，但是感觉 Snap 一直没有得到人们的喜爱。尤其是中国没有 Snap 商店的镜像，使用起来更是难受。




谷歌悬赏开源供应链安全漏洞

谷歌推出了一项新的漏洞奖励计划，向发现其开源软件或其软件所基于的构建模块中的安全漏洞的研究人员支付报酬。它将为 Angular、GoLang 和 Fuchsia 等项目中的漏洞或这些项目代码库中包含的第三方依赖的漏洞的信息支付最高超过三万美元的奖金。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：虽然对谷歌来说，自己的软件安全很重要，但是来自开源供应链上的风险可能会导致意料之外的更大风险。




亚马逊和谷歌指责微软云计算的垄断行为

亚马逊和谷歌发表声明，指责微软作出的最新软件业务调整将阻碍客户转移到云计算竞争平台，影响市场公平竞争。周一，微软宣布了一系列包括软件授权政策在内的调整，新政策将会在 10 月 1 日开始生效，微软声称，新政策将有利于云计算市场的玩家更好的竞争。然而，微软宣布的软件授权政策调整中，排除了亚马逊、谷歌、阿里巴巴和微软自己的云服务。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：说实话没太看明白，微软这不是连自家的云也限制了嘛。另外，现在的公有云挣扎在锁定和避免锁定之间，公有云理应是不锁定的，但是大的云服务商总想能锁定一些比较好。</span>

                              <span>又一个 Markdown 编辑器？我们见的 Markdown 编辑器还少吗？

我明白你的感受，如果你是个 Markdown 爱好者，你可能已经用过很多 Markdown 编辑器了，比如 Joplin 和 Zettlr。但如果你不是的话，你可能根本就不在乎。

Markdown 是一个非常好的标记语言，特别是对那些在网络上写作的人来说。我不想在这里讲太多细节，但如果你有兴趣的话，我们有一篇 非常棒的 Markdown 初学者教程。

这次我想推荐给你（另一个）Markdown 编辑器，它叫 Marktext，并且它是用 Electron 制作的（我们都明白这什么意思，先别急着埋怨我）。

我发现这将是一个很完美的编辑器。它很漂亮，而它运行起来也一样棒。下面是我这几天来的使用体验。

Marktext: 人人可用的 Markdown 编辑器

尽管我很讨厌 Electron 框架，但不得不承认基于 Electron 的应用都有一个干净、现代的界面。



我更喜欢深色模式主题，除此之外官方还提供了五种其它主题。



打开软件你就可以立刻进行写作，如果你不记得某个语法了，那也没有问题，输入 @ 就可以得到语法提示，如：


标题

分隔线

表格

Latex 数学公式

HTML 块

代码块

引用

列表

检查清单

用 Vega-lite.js、Flowchart.js、js-sequence-diagrams 和 PlantUML 制作的图表




选中文本你会得到一个格式选项框，来改变文本为粗体、斜体、下划线、删除线等。你也可以用黄色背景高亮文本、转换为内联代码、内联公式或插入超链接。



Marktext 也支持图片。我们都知道图片不是 Markdown 文件的一部分，它们是外部元素，但是你可以选择将图片…</span>

                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">
                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>GNOME 43 即将到来。下面是你可以期待在该版本中出现的功能。




GNOME 43 将于 2022 年 9 月 21 日发布。截至目前，GNOME 43 的测试版已经可供测试。

我们在 GNOME 43 测试版中发现的功能和变化应该随着最终版本的发布而到来。

那么，哪些是你最值得期待的 GNOME 43 功能呢？

让我们来看看一些关键的变化。

这个列表集中在视觉/交互式变化上。关于技术变化的完整列表，你可以参考文章底部链接的更新日志。

1、改造了快速设置



GNOME 桌面菜单位于右上角，你可以在这里快速调整音量、访问网络连接，以及开/关电脑，在这个版本中它终于得到了视觉上的更新。

现在，它看起来更像是安卓的快速切换栏，这应该会增强用户体验，同时减少一些多余的点击。



你不需要前往设置来打开深色模式和夜光。新的快速切换菜单就可以让你可以访问到它们。

此外，像选择 Wi-Fi 网络和改变音频设备这样的事情比以前更容易做到。

2、对 Nautilus 文件管理器的改变

虽然我们已经在之前的报道中提到了 GNOME 43 中对 Nautilus 最重要的改变。


GNOME 43 中 Nautilus 文件管理器的 6 个新变化


有几件事值得再次重申。其中一些包括：


使用 GTK 4 的全新外观。

拖动和选择文件的能力（橡皮筋选择）。

紧凑窗口的自适应视图。

新的文件上下文菜单。




总的来说，在 GNOME 43 中，你会发现 Nautilus 文件管理器有了一些视觉上的调整，并有动画的细微改进。

你可以点击每一个选项，访问目录的属性等等来探索其中的差异。它应该感觉更直观一些。

3、设备安全信息



我们之前报道过 GNOME 会在你禁用安全启动时显示警告。


安全启动已被禁用？ GNOME将很快向您发出警告！


你会在你的闪屏和锁屏中看到这个警告。

GNOME 的设置菜单也有一个新的 “设备安全” 选项，在这里你可以看到安全启动状态和其他重要信息，比如：


TPM

英特尔 BootGuard

IOMMU 保护


4、GNOME Web 的扩展支持



GNOME Web 在每次更新都会变得更好一些。有了 Web 扩展的支持，它成为了一个有吸引力的选择，可以取代你的日常使用的浏览器。


有了扩展，GNOME Web 正慢慢成为桌面 Linux 上一个有吸引力的选择


在写这篇文章的时候，该支持仍然是 实验性的，你必须得手动安装扩展。

对于初学者来说，你可以在 Mozilla Firefox 附加组件门户上下载 .xpi 扩展文件。

5、GNOME 软件中心的改进

GNOME 的软件中心目前的体验并不是很好。

虽然它在提供额外信息方面有所改进，但仍有改进的余地。



在 GNOME 43 中，你可以了解到更多关于 Flatpak 应用程序所需的权限。而且，你还可以看到一个 “其他应用程序” 部分，以寻找同一开发者的其它应用程序。

此外，软件包来源的显示方式也有了细微的视觉调整。



附加：新的墙纸

你会得到新的默认壁纸，有深色和浅色的变体。下面是深色壁纸背景的样子：



而这是浅色版本：



除了主要的亮点之外，其他一些变化包括：


Adwaita 图标主题更新。

GNOME 应用程序的性能改进。

各种代码的清理。

对日历的改进。

改良了“关于”窗口。


关于完整的技术细节，你可以参考 GNOME 43 测试版更新日志。

总的来说，GNOME 43 在很大程度上注重提高可用性和用户体验。

最初还计划了一些有趣的功能，但它们没有进入 GNOME 43。也许，GNOME 44 会包括这些？


这里是开发者为 GNOME 43 规划的内容


你对 GNOME 43 的功能有何看法？请在下面的评论中告诉我们你的想法。

In this series, I&#x27;m developing several scripts to help in cleaning up my music collection. In the last article I wrote and tested a Groovy script to clean up the motley assembly of tag fields. In this article, I&#x27;ll separate the framework I&#x27;ve been using into a separate class and then write a test program to exercise it.
Install Java and Groovy
Groovy is based on Java and requires a Java installation. Both a recent and decent version of Java and Groovy might be in your Linux distribution&#x27;s repositories. Groovy can also be installed following the instructions on the Groovy homepage. A nice alternative for Linux users is SDKMan, which can be used to get multi…</span>

To be an effective leader in an open source community, you need a lot of information. How do I know who the most active members in my community are? Which companies are making the most contributions? Which contributors are drifting away and becoming inactive? Who in the community is knowledgeable about a specific topic?
These were just a few of the questions I had when I started leading the Mautic community at Acquia. But the problem was not a shortage of information. On the contrary, there were so many places our community interacted and so many things to track that I was drowning in data. I could access plenty of data sources, but they were not …</span>

作者免责和警示信息：我国目前现行的法律法规对代餐类产品并无严格的规范和限制，在选择代餐产品时请务必慎重。本文作者与文中出现的任何品牌（或其竞争对手）均无利益关联，亦不为文中出现的任何品牌做推荐或背书。有关长期使用代餐的风险和副作用的研究证据仍然不充分，有代谢相关疾病或慢性肝、肾疾病的人士在使用代餐产品前务必征得医生许可。孕妇、哺乳期妇女、婴幼儿、儿童、老人等人群如无特殊需要，最好不食用代餐食品。

根据中国营养学会发布的《代餐食品》团体标准，代餐食品被定义为「为了满足成年人控制体重期间一餐或两餐的营养需要，专门加工配制而成的控制能量食品」。有一些代餐食品能够完全替代一餐的全部正常食物，另一些则只能替代部分正常食物。后者一般称为「部分代餐食品」。
为了便于理解、简化讨论，下文中对完全代餐和部分代餐食品将不做专门区分。
代餐能代替三餐吗？
常见的两个代餐使用场景一是「不想 / 不能 / 不愿意做饭」，另一是「减脂和 / 或体重控制」。有关前者的讨论已有不少。感兴趣的读者可移步阅读下列一些文章。
  
以代餐完全取代三餐有一个前提，就是你选择的产品应该成分可靠、营养全面、配比合理。不过很遗憾，常规的商业代餐产品如 Soylent 或若饭都很难达到这个要求。Soylent 液体版（每瓶 414 毫升，提供 400 千卡热量）的碳水、蛋白质和脂肪供能比为 35%-19%-46%，若饭的供能比之类似。根据《中国居民膳食营养素参考摄入量（2017 年发布）》，18-60 岁成年人每日通过脂肪摄入的热量占比不应超过 30%，碳水化合物的供能比最低…</span>

Dart 2.18 版本开始提供与 Objective-C 和 Swift 交互的能力预览，以及在这基础上构建的新 iOS / macOS 包支持。
Dart 2.18 还包含对通用函数的类型推断改进、异步代码的性能改进、新的 pub.dev 功能支持以及对工具和核心库的整理。
最后，还有最新的 null safety 迁移状态解析，以及通往完全 null safety 的重要路线图更新。

Dart 支持与 Objective-C 和 Swift 交互的能力
在 2020 年的时候我们预览了用于调用原生 C API 的 Dart 外函数接口（FFI），并于 2021 年 3 月在 Dart 2.12 中发布了它。
自该版本发布以来，大量软件包利用此功能与现有的原生C API集成，例如： file_picker、printing、win32、objectbox、realm、isar、tflite_flutter和 dbus 等。
Dart 团队希望支持所运行平台上所有主要语言的交互能力，而 Dart 2.18达到了实现这一目标的下一个里程碑。
在 2.18， Dart 代码可以调用 Objective-C 和 Swift 代码，这通常用于调用 macOS 和 iOS 平台上的API，Dart在任何应用中都支持这种互操作机制，从CLI 应用到后端代码和 Flutter UI。
这种新机制其实是利用了 Objective-C 和 Swift 代码可以基于 API 绑定 C 代码公开，Dart API 包装了生成工具 ffigen ，可以从 API 标头创建这些绑定。

本次更新带来了 Flutter Web 平台、桌面端平台、文本处理的性能和其他更新内容。
同时我们也会介绍 go_router package、DevTools (开发者工具) 和 VS Code 扩展相关的更新内容。与我们一起阅读详细了解它们吧！
框架更新
全局选择
到现在为止，Flutter 在 Web 上的文本选择交互仍然没有达到预期。与 Flutter 应用不同，原生的 Web 应用会将每个节点构建为树形结构。在传统的 Web 应用中你可以轻松用拖动手势来选择网页上的节点，这在 Flutter Web 应用中无法轻松达成。
从今天起，一切都发生了变化。我们引入了 SelectionArea widget，它的子 widget 现已可以进行随意选择！

只需使用 SelectionArea 包裹住路由显示的内容 (例如 Scaffold)，Flutter 会替你处理好一切，你便可以享受到这项强力的新特性。
想要更全面深入地了解这个绝妙的新功能，请访问 SelectionArea API 页面。
触控板操作
Flutter 3.3 优化了针对触控板的支持。Flutter 不仅提供了更丰富且顺滑的控制，同时也减少了几种特定情况的误触。若你想了解误触的示例，你可以查看 Flutter 实用教程 页面。将页面滚动到底部的 DartPad，并跟随以下步骤进行操作：

《Flutter 绘制集录 | 秒表盘的绘制》
《Flutter 绘制集录 | 秒表运动与Ticker》
1. 业务逻辑和构建逻辑
对界面呈现来说，最重要的逻辑有两个部分：业务数据的维护逻辑 和 界面布局的构建逻辑 。其中应用运行中相关数据的获取、修改、删除、存储等操作，就是业务逻辑。比如下面是秒表的三个界面，核心 数据 是秒表的时刻。在秒表应用执行功能时，数据的变化体现在秒数的变化、记录、重置等。
默认情况
暂停
记录











界面的构建逻辑主要体现在界面如何布局，维持界面的出现效果。另外，在界面构建过程中，除了业务数据，还有一些数据会影响界面呈现。比如打开秒表时，只有一个启动按钮；在运行中，显示暂停按钮和记录按钮；在暂停时，记录按钮不可用，重置按钮可用。这样在不同的交互场景中，有不同的界面表现，也是构建逻辑处理的一部分。

2. 数据的维护
所以的逻辑本身都是对 数据 的维护，界面能够显示出什么内容，都依赖于数据进行表现。理解需要哪些数据、数据存储在哪里，从哪里来，要传到哪里去，是编程过程中非常重要的一个环节。由于数据需要在构建界面时使用，所以很自然的：在布局写哪里，数据就在哪里维护。
比如默认的计数器项目，其中只有一个核心数据 _counter ，用于表示当前点击的次数。

代码实现时， _counter 数据定义在 _MyHomePageState 中，改数据的维护也在状…</span>

Flutter 3.3 正式发布啦，本次更新带来了 Flutter Web、桌面、文本性能处理等相关更新，另外，本次还为 go_router 、DevTools 和 VS Code 扩展引入了更多更新。
Framework
Global Selection
Flutter Web 在之前的版本中，经常会有选择文本时与预期的行为不匹配的情况，因为与 Flutter  App 一样，原生 Web 是由 elements 树组成。
在传统的 Web 应用中，开发者可以通过一个拖动手势选择多个 Web 元素，但这在 Flutter Web 上无法轻松完成。
但是从 3.3 开始，随着SelectableArea 的引入， SelectableArea Widget 的任何 Child 都可以自由启用改能力。

要利用这个强大的新特性，只需使用 SelectionArea 嵌套你的页面，比如路由下的 Scaffold，然后让 Flutter 就会完成剩下的工作。
要更全面地深入了解这个新功能，请访问 SelectableArea API
触控板输入
Flutter 3.3 改进了对触控板输入的支持，这不仅提供了更丰富和更流畅的控制逻辑，还减少了某些情况下的错误识别。
举个例子，在  Flutter cookbook  中拖动 UI 元素页面，滚动到页面底部，然后执行以下步骤：
缩小窗口大小，使上部呈现滚动条
悬停在上部

                              <span>引言
许久没有静下来心来玩一款游戏了，前这几日宅在家里，体验了一下《光·遇》，而又联想到许多以前玩过的游戏，有感而发，遂就此文。由于专业的关系，本科学教育学时读过一些心理学，硕士念的也是中国哲学，因此本文会较为深入地去分析游戏的价值与影响，对游戏玩法、交互体验、设计美学的分析会稍少。本文将主要以美学的角度来赏析《光·遇》的美术风格，以心理学的角度去分析《光·遇》的核心玩法，以解释学的视角来诠释《光·遇》的禅意社交，最后以存在主义的核心价值作为文章收尾。虽以《光·遇》为始，但最后分析的也不仅仅是《光·遇》。综上，文章整体脉络变构成了“四位一体”的第九艺术分析。

美术风格：意象、自由、审美价值
意象
意象是审美中“美”本身，是美之本体。在美学的演化中，如果说有一个概念关注美学本身，那就是意象。《光·遇》中光怪陆离的风景意象如同卡尔维诺的《看不见的城市》那样，是现实与心中的那些虚构之城，交相辉映，轮回交替，更像是一场灵魂的旅行，带着思索穿梭于各个城市之间。
所谓意象，由“意”与“象”构成，“意”即诗意，而“象”并不只是指具象，也包括想象。我们先来看看其中之”象“。想象，是假定与自由的象征，假定了，感情才有自由。反过来说，若《光·遇》中场景如实反映生活，不存在那些会发光的蝴蝶、会漂浮在空中的水母、会上天如海的鲲鹏、漂浮在空中的城市，而仅是拘泥于现实生活中存在的物体，那么没有想象，感情就没有自由，也就没有诗意了。所以我们说，艺术的精致，就在于是一种情感、联想、语言的精致。作为第九艺术的游戏，《光·遇》将这种艺术的精致发挥的淋漓精致。

如果说想象是美学的灵魂，那么诗意是美学的境界。意象之中不但有极其精炼的“象”，而且有极其独特的“意”。所谓意境，不仅仅是意象群落之间的建构，而是意象与意象之间沿着意脉延伸发展而出的那般足以表达诗意的境界。
以《光·遇》之中的雨林来看，整体意象包括了绵…</span>

                              <span>关于PSB保罗巴顿音箱
如果说起音箱，那么一起会想到SONY、BOSE、JBL、雅马哈、哈曼卡顿这些品牌，毕竟他们已在国内深耕多年，有着相当大的品牌影响力和听众基础。

但如果有深入了解音频产品的话，必然或多或少会听到过PSB保罗巴顿这个品牌。毕竟PSB保罗巴顿也是一个拥有着50年历史的经典音响品牌，在国外的音频电子消费品市场中有着举足轻重的地位，其推出的Synchrony T600就是CES 2022唯一获奖的被动式音箱，也是当前PSB保罗巴顿的旗舰级音箱产品。

之所以PSB保罗巴顿在国内会小众，主要原因还是以前的购买途径只能海淘或代购，例如我看中的一套PSB Alpha系列低音炮，也只能求助于亚马逊，可想而知是有多麻烦。现今总算在国内上市，在某猫和某东都有了正规购买途径，售后和品质都有了保障。
也正因PSB保罗巴顿在某猫上的入驻，才让我有机会将PSB Alpha AM3这对「宝藏」书架音箱收入囊中，接下来咱们就品一下这对箱子的味道。

声音的变化
观影效果如何？

在观影方面建议将PSB Alpha AM3书架音箱切换到对话模式或者WideSound Plus模式，前者突出人声部分，后者是加强人声的同时也扩展声场，具体可以视影片的类型而定。
例如在回顾复联4时，就可以考虑优先启用WideSound Plus模式。在此模式下，场面感更宏大，双方互冲时更加激动人心，低音效果爆棚，各种爆炸声、轰鸣声在我面前炸裂，临场感相当赞。在场面混乱低音效果较足的情况下，人物间的对白依旧能保持清晰，具有很好的方位感。

而在一些以对白叙事为主的影片中，启用对话模式会更优。此时的人物对白会更突出，情绪感动细节被放大，可以更好地展现人物的内在情绪，让观者更容易被带入至影片的情绪中。

常规音乐播放体验

提到音乐播放，那么不得不拿出我CD随身听。这是17年前的产物，应该算是当年SONY发布的…</span>

                              <span>疑问
《卡片笔记写作法》(How to Take Smart Notes) 一书的热销，和一系列双链笔记的出现，使得这种更为「现代化」的笔记方式显得非常酷。最近看文章和刷视频，总能遇到有作者感慨对该方法「相见恨晚」，随后进行一番解读。
很多读者和观众看后，会羡慕不已，然后给这些内容点赞。但是，你有没有想过，卡片笔记写作法为什么管用？如何有效发挥作用？为什么很多人高呼「过瘾」，而另一些人嗤之以鼻呢？
我最近重读《福格行为模型》，对这个问题有了新的感悟。故写作本文为你分享。
动机
在我看来，卡片笔记和传统写作 (胸怀锦绣，下笔千言，甚至滔滔不绝) 最大的区别，在于对普通人写作「动机」这个事儿是不是有合理的预判。
很多人会购买健身房的年卡，然后很快就不再去了。这一笔进项，对于许多健身房来说，足够可观，且喜闻乐见。有趣的是，即便很多人听说过类似的故事，也不能抵御自己「付费购买健身年卡」的冲动。因为他们坚信，自己有充分的动机，会坚持健身。那些意志不坚定，导致花冤枉钱的事儿，一定不会出现在自己身上。
这事儿当然不止体现在健身房，你耳熟能详的例子应该还包括购买软件的年度会员功能订阅等。甚至，因为有时候促销，人们会一口气买它若干年的。
为什么呢？
因为不止一项研究的科学证据显示，人们会显著高估自己高水平动机的持续性。
而实际情况则不然。动机并不会一直悬空在那里，而是会受到很多因素的影响来波动。换句话说，你无法指望动机是个「永动机」 ，只做工不耗能。既然要耗能，原料之一便叫做「鸡血」。所以你会常听说一种叫做「打鸡血」或者「画大饼」的行为。你不要嘲笑这种行为很 low ，对于某些人来说，它非常有效且必要。

回到我们的主题（写作）。普通人会对自己的写作动机有过高的预期。例如说从今天开始，每天一千字，一个月搞定硕士毕业论文；或者每天 500 字，半年搞定一本小说……
实际上，几乎没有人能够保障这…</span>

一、前言
上一篇文章 Compose回忆童年 - 手拉灯绳-开灯/关灯里面82年钨丝灯，让我又有了新的想法，我们怎么照亮手机里面的文本内容呢？
我们会在上一篇文章的基础上来实现“挑灯夜看”的功能，怎么下手呢？往下看👇
二、文本着色器
我们想要实现照亮功能，那肯定需要有不亮的文本内容。
通过透明度来可以吗？肯定不行，文本内容是可以上下滑动的，是一个整体，我们不能通过透明度来做。
在看到小米手机的文本着色效果之后：

我知道如何下手了，我先来看看Compose的Text如何做渐变着色？
1. 有些同学可能喜欢用Canvas去绘制：
Canvas(...) {
   drawIntoCanvas { canvas -&gt;
       canvas.nativeCanvas.drawText(text, x, y, paint)
   }
}

2. 我们可以使用Modifeir的drawWithCache修饰符，官方文档的链接里面也给我们了不少示例。

Text(
    text &#x3D; &quot;永远相信美好的事情即将发生❤️&quot;,
    modifier &#x3D; Modifier
        .graphicsLayer(alpha &#x3D; 0.99f)
        .drawWithCache {
            val brush &#x3D; Brush.horizontalGradient(
                listOf(
                     Color(0xFFE24CE2),

在学习和借鉴美团 modular-event 方案中很多优秀的设计思想后，我亦发现方案中依然存在不一致风险和不足，故我决定对方案进行改进并向社区开源。项目主页为 Github · ModularEventBus，演示 Demo 可直接下载：
Demo apk。
欢迎提 Issue 帮助修复缺陷，欢迎提 Pull Request 增加新的 Feature，有用请点赞给 Star，给小彭一点创作的动力，谢谢。

虽然 Firefox 仍然是 Debian 的默认浏览器，但很多 Linux 用户都会安装 Chrome 浏览器的开源上游 Chromium 浏览器。早些时候，在 Debian 中提供的 Chromium 使用谷歌作为默认搜索引擎。最近，Debian 发布公告称，“由于隐私原因，将默认搜索引擎改为 DuckDuckGo”。这个决定并不是匆忙做出的，因为这个提议是在两年前提出的，只是近日才得以通过。

法国用 AI 发现未申报的私人游泳池，开出千万欧元账单

因为建造游泳池能提高房价，意味着更高的财产税，根据法国法律，业主需要申报其建造的游泳池。2020 年法国有逾 320 万个私人游泳池，新冠疫情期间愈来愈多的人在家办公，游泳池的安装量也进一步激增。法国税务部门使用由谷歌等公司开发的 AI 软件，可以在航拍图像上识别游泳池，并与土地登记数据库进行交叉检查。结果发现了超过 2 万个未申报的私人游泳池，这些业主将收到总额约为 1000 万欧元的账单。

Web3 DNS 供应商可能失去其域名

ENS 是一种运行在以太坊上的域名服务，用于在 Web3 中便捷地访问各种地址。但是如果想在互联网上访问它，通常需要一种特别的 DNS 服务商，其中 eth.link 是使用最多的一个。但是，该域名的所有者因故入狱，因此这个域名没有办法续费，面临过期。eth.link 于 7 月 26 日到期，并将于 9 月 5 日被域名注册商收回，届时它将可能被抢注并用于恶意用途。在试图由其他人替代续费，而被域名注册商拒绝之后，ENS DAO 已经建议用户使用另外一个 eth.limo 域名作为替代。

老王点评：这就很不 Web3，一个常用的服务依赖于某个具体的人。事实上，现在以“去中心化”为目标的的 Web3 的基础设施，几乎都是由中心化的人或组织控制的。</span>

                              <span>Bash 有一些方便的自动化功能，可以让我在 Linux 上处理文件时更轻松。


通过 Bash 命令行进行自动化任务是极好的一种方式。不论你使用运行在服务器上的 Linux 进行管理日志文件或其他文件，还是你在个人电脑上整理文件以使桌面保持整洁，使用 Bash 的自动化功能会使你的工作变得更轻松。

自动执行文件任务：for

如果你对一堆文件要同时处理，并且对每个文件进行相同的操作，请使用 for 命令。该命令会遍历文件列表，并执行一个或多个命令。for 命令如下所示：

for 变量 in 列表
do
    命令
done


我在示例中添加了额外的空白和换行，来分开 for 命令中不同的部分。看起来好像无法在命令行中同时运行多个命令，不过你可以使用 ; 将所有命令放在同一行中，就像这样:

for 变量 in 列表 ; do 命令 ; done


让我们看看它的实际效果。我使用 for 命令来重命名一些文件。最近，我有一些截图，想要重命名。这些截图名称为 filemgr.png 或 terminal.png，我想将 screenshot 放在每个名称前。我可以使用 for 命令一次性将 30 个文件重命名。这是两个文件的示例：

$ ls
filemgr.png  terminal.png
$ for f in *.png ; do mv $f screenshot-$f ; done
$ ls
screenshot-filemgr.png  screenshot-terminal.png


for 命令使得在一系列文件中执行一种或多种操作变得容易。你可以用一些有意义的变量名，比如 image 或 screenshot，或者你用示例中“缩写的”变量 f。当我在使用 for 循环写脚本的时候，会选择有意义的变量名。但是当…</span>

王兴宇：

如今国内的各个开源操作系统百花齐放，但是与国际厂商相比，大家认为我们目前的强项在哪里，弱项在哪里？

王戍靖：

近年来国内操作系统开源社区发展迅速，但发展时间短，与国际社区相比有一定差距。操作系统社区基于大量基础技术，包括芯片、编译、开发工具等基础技术领域，也包括大数据、人工智能、云计算等新兴技术方向，需要长期培育积累和技术创新。

有利条件是中国开源处于快速发展阶段，中国开发者数量增长快，据 GitHub 2021 年数据统计，中国开发者数量已增至 700 多万，排名全球第二，贡献了 550 万个开源项目；另外，我国数字经济转型升级推动信息产业持续增长，新兴技术领域也在迅速发展。以上都为国内开源操作系统社区发展提供了坚实的基础和动力。

陈鲍孜：

从主导具体的开源项目看，国内操作系统社区的发展还是有欠缺的，毕竟我们参与的时间比较短。但国内的开发人员不管从数量还是活跃程度方面，在国际上即使不是最好的，…</span>

                              <span>你如何列出 Linux 中的 USB 设备？

这个问题可以有两种含义。


你的系统上有（检测到）多少个 USB 端口？

系统安装（插入）了多少个 USB 设备/磁盘？


大多数情况下，人们有兴趣了解哪些 USB 设备连接到系统。这可能有助于对 USB 设备进行故障排除。

最可靠的方法是使用这个命令：

lsusb


它显示了网络摄像头、蓝牙和以太网端口以及 USB 端口和挂载的 USB 驱动器。



但是理解 lsusb 的输出并不容易，当你只想查看和访问已挂载的 USB 驱动器时，你可能不需要那么复杂。

我将向你展示可用于列出连接到系统的 USB 设备的各种工具和命令。

除非另有说明，在我的例子中连接了一个 2GB 的 U 盘、1TB 的外置硬盘、通过 MTP 连接的 Android 智能手机，以及 USB 鼠标。

让我从桌面用户最简单的选项开始。

以图形方式检查连接的 USB 设备

你的发行版的文件管理器可以用来查看连接到你的计算机的 USB 存储设备。正如你在下面的 Nautilus（GNOME 文件管理器）的截图中看到的那样。

连接的设备显示在边栏中（此处仅显示 USB 存储设备）。



你还可以使用 GNOME “磁盘Disks” 或 Gparted 等 GUI 应用来查看、格式化和分区连接到计算机的 USB 存储设备。默认情况下，大多数使用 GNOME 桌面环境的发行版都预装了 GNOME “磁盘”。

这个应用也可以用作一个非常好的 分区管理器。



图形工具足够了。让我们讨论可用于列出 USB 设备的命令。

使用 mount 命令列出挂载的 USB 设备

mount 命令用于挂载 Linux 中的分区。你还可以使用相同的命令列出 USB 存储设备。

通常，USB 存储挂载…</span>

Lately, I&#x27;ve been looking at how Groovy streamlines Java. In this series, I&#x27;m developing several scripts to help in cleaning up my music collection. In my last article, I used the framework developed previously to create a list of unique file names and counts of occurrences of those file names in the music collection directory. I then used the Linux find command to get rid of files I didn&#x27;t want.
In this article, I demonstrate a Groovy script to clean up the motley assembly of tag fields.
WARNING: This script alters music tags, so it is vital that you make a backup of the music collection you test your code on.

When someone needs to share their screen with you, or you need to share your screen with someone else, you have several options to choose from. Video conferencing software, like the open source Jitsi web app, and while we call that &quot;screen sharing,&quot; it&#x27;s really presenting. You&#x27;re presenting your screen to others, but they can&#x27;t interact with it. Sometimes you actually want to share your screen and your mouse cursor with a trusted friend or colleague, and the tool for that is VNC (Virtual Network Computing), and it&#x27;s built into your Linux desktop.

Here are some of its features:

⚡️ Keyframing with custom easing
🎚 Image and video filters (adjustments, blur, chroma key...)
✂️ Trim and cut videos
👀 Layer masking
🔊 Audio support
🔍 Search for images, videos, shapes and more
✨ Text animation (typewriter, scale, fade...)
💥 Lottie support
🧩 Pixabay integration
...and much more - all for free &amp; no sign in needed!

I shared a lot of my progress building this editor in my newsletter, if you&#x27;re curious. Ultimately while I had a lot of plans for it, I realized that it was far too challenging to work with the old and outdated codebase, and I would have had to rewrite the whole thing from zero using some framework to make any substantial progress with it. So I decided to just launch it as is, for free and without any fancy gimmicks.

The code is available on GitHub if you&#x27;d like to contribute to Motionity, self-host it, or build your own motion graphics editor.

一、前言
之前发布的一篇Compose制作一个“IOS”效果的SwitchButton
有位掘友评论：“手势配合Animatable也可以尝试一下”

手机上我想修改之前回复的评论，没想到删除自己的评论，他的评论也没有了，准备回复的内容也没了，想着顺手写一篇和Animatable相关的文章吧。
回到本篇文章的另一个起源吧，想到小时候顺着那白色开关垂下来的灯绳，拉一下“咔哒”一声，再拉一下又是“咔哒”一声。当时年龄小感觉新奇总是把灯开了关又关了开的拉着玩，以至于好几次拉坏了开关灯绳。
今天我们在手机上做一个拉不坏的灯绳😄，怀念一下童年🤣。

二、材料准备
在App里面准备一个弹簧绳😄，我们想奢侈一下，躺在床上拉灯绳。
绳末尾底部的疙瘩，替换成：夜光球 ，毕竟现在2022年了，夜晚总不能黑灯瞎火摸着找灯绳吧，你们觉得呢？
准备一个82年的钨丝灯泡💡，拉菲也得配个82年的，才有氛围感。
三、安装82年的钨丝灯和灯绳
我们要知道材料所需要占用最大的宽度和最小宽度，可以用BoxWithConstraints做容器，里面放我们的灯泡和灯绳以及我们的“夜光球”。
我们知道BoxWidthConstraints可以获得屏幕上Composable的最小/最大可用宽度和高度，可以根据可用空间使用它来显示不同的内容。
1. 使用Image来显示我们的钨丝灯:
Image(
   alpha &#x3D; state.wsdAlpha,
   modifier &#x3D; Modifier.align(Alignment.TopCenter).size(100.dp),
   painter &#x3D; painterResource(id &#x3D; R.drawable.ic_wsd),

前言
本文的目的在于绘制练习，将被收录在 FlutterUnit 的绘制集录当中。另外在 《Flutter 语法基础 - 梦始之地》 中有一章需要使用这个表盘，但并不想涉及过多的绘制知识，故而在此进行实现。效果如下，外圈是线条围成的表盘，内部有个小圆指示当前位置，中间显示信息文字。

1. 需求分析
这里绘制的是 秒表表盘，一圈是 1 分种 ，每秒有对应 3 格，也就是说一共有 180 格，每格间的夹角是 2° 。下面来看一下绘制过程中需要的参数，首先需要一个 Duration 对象，表示当前秒表的时间。另外，根据时间可以计算出小圆的角度。
绘制时可以配置的参数，比如半径、刻度颜色、文字颜色、样式等。另外刻度的长短、粗细、小圆半径等更细致的参数可以根据半径进行计算得出。

2. 刻度绘制
如下所示正方形是绘制区域，左侧刻度宽为 scaleLineWidth，通过矩形区域的宽度和 _kScaleWidthRate 比例来确定。
const double _kScaleWidthRate &#x3D; 0.4/10;
final double scaleLineWidth &#x3D; size.width*_kScaleWidthRate;


绘制刻度时使用直线，只要确定左右两点坐标即可。如下 tag1 处将坐标原点移至区域中心，很容易可以计算出刻度的坐标，如下 tag2 所示。
final Paint scalePainter &#x3D; Paint();
@override
void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  canvas.translate(size.width/2, size.height/2); // tag1

In this series, I&#x27;m developing several scripts to help in cleaning up my music collection. In the last article, we used the framework created for analyzing the directory and sub-directories of music files, checking to make sure each album has a cover.jpg file and recording any other files that aren&#x27;t FLAC, MP3, or OGG.
I uncovered a few files that can obviously be deleted—I see the odd foo lying around—and a bunch of PDFs, PNGs, and JPGs that are album art. With that in mind, and thinking about the cruft removal task, I offer an improved script that uses a Groovy map to record file names and counts of their occurrences and print that in CSV form…</span>

When you have a lot of related files, it&#x27;s sometimes easier to treat them as a single object rather than 3 or 20 or 100 unique files. There are fewer clicks involved, for instance, when you email one file compared to the mouse work required to email 30 separate files. This quandary was solved decades ago when programmers invented a way to create an archive, and so the tar command was born (the name stands for tape archive because back then, files were saved to magnetic tape.) Today tar remains a useful way to bundle files together, whether it&#x27;s to compress them so they take up less space on your drive, to make it easier to deal with lots of files, or to logically group…</span>

                              <span>Hi 大家好，我是 3x3 的作者 KIDSTYO
在2022年初的时候，我制作发布了自己的第一款苹果平台应用 3x3
这是一款采用极简主义设计风格（参考Windows Phone）的时间管理应用
在此之前，我在少数派上看到很多朋友都在用自己的方式结合市面上的工具来搭建自己的时间管理体系
其中有一些关键词，比如间歇式日记、柳比歇夫时间记录法、双链等
其中一些理念，让我觉得和 3x3 的理念很类似，所以也是经过半年多的迭代完善后，想向各位介绍这款工具
我自己不太会写文章，所以这篇文章的内容可能会比较简单
我希望能分享一下我为什么要做这个软件以及分享我自己和一些用户的使用体验
3x3 的理念
首先我想分享一段话，这正是 3x3 核心理念：dots will somehow connect in your future

You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.

3x3 可以轻松的记录日常的时间线，可以关联每日、周、月、年、甚至人生的待办或者标签，并且待办之间可以进行双向链接
做3x3的想法就是，过了很多年之后，我还可以方便的找到当天做过有意义的事情
然后可以将所有事情串联起来，比如我学习一样事情，阅读一本书，可以清晰的知道每个阶段的过程，甚至你可以制作你自己的10000小时计划
3x3 的设计想法在 2018 年初，就有了，当时我还做了一个简单的网页，它…</span>

                              <span>在 WWDC22 上，Apple 发布 iOS 16 的时候，公布了一个功能叫实时活动，并向开发者开放 Live Activities API。

那么什么实时活动呢？
实时活动是一种新的交互式消息通知，用户可以在 iPhone 的锁屏界面看到事件的实时更新。比如球赛的比分、打车或订餐的订单状态、运动锻炼的实时数据等。这种消息通知形式允许开发者在实时活动期间更新单个交互式通知，而不是每次有状态更新时都发送新通知。通过减少发送的通知数量，同时使信息更易于访问。
Uber海外版团队设计的实时活动界面
Apple 在 iOS 16 开发者测试版 Beta 4 首次向开发者提供 ActivityKit 开发套件，首次在真机实装，随后在 Beta 6 和 Beta 7 并没有在真机实装实时活动功能。开发者目前只能在模拟器测试这项功能，或者降级回 Beta 4 或 Beta 5。Apple 在开发者网站也明确表示实时活动不会在首个 iOS16 正式版推出，而是在今年晚些时候的正式版突出。下图是模仿目前已有的原神安卓小组件、iOS 小组件做的实时活动版小组件。到了 8 月 16 日一大早用手机更新 Beta 6 之后，手机就不能运行和测试实时活动了，随后也看到其他开发者反馈实时活动在 Beta 6 版本没有实装。本文后面的截图只能在模拟器截取了，但模拟器不能更改壁纸，只有黑色背景。
Xcode真机调试报错ActivityKit没实装
实时活动界面部分是小组件扩展，开发者使用 WidgetKit 功能和 SwiftUI 编写界面布局，ActivityKit 是处理配置、启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动是一种消息通知，是一种可以自定义界面布局和更新状态的消息通知。下图是普通类型的消息通知，或许以后能看到换了界面布局的降雨提醒。
普通的消息通知类型
实时活动要求和限制
与小组件不同的是，小组件是通过时间线机制更新界面数据，实时活动是通过远程推送或 ActivityKit 从主应用程序来启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动无法访问网络或接收位置更新，下图网络请求图片失败。

ActivityKit 更新和远程推送通知更新的更新动态数据大小不能超过 4KB。
实时活动界面不能包含可交互元素，例如按钮和 WebView。当用户点击实时活动界面，将会打开主应用程序。
自定义实时活动的用户界面时，系统会忽略任何自定义动画，但可以使用系统自带的时间文本动画，当实时活动的动态内容发生变化时，系统会执行一些动画。文本视图通过模糊的内容过渡动画内容变化，系统为图像和 SF Symbols 符号动画内容过渡，根据内容或状态更改从用户界面添加或删除视图，视图会淡入淡出。
系统自带的时间文本动画系统为图像内容变化作出的动画效果
在开发者网站的描述中，如果实时活动的高度超过 160，系统可能会截断它。在实际测试中，实时活动界面最小高度为 64，最大高度可以达到 220。目前实时活动功能还不是正式的版本，有可能在之后的测试版本会有改变。

当用户在 App 首次启动时，点击允许应用程序发送通知时，就代表允许 App 发送实时活动通知，不允许则不会收到实时活动的通知。之后在系统设置 - 对应的 App -实时活动，可以关闭/开启实时活动权限。
实时活动权限位置
实时活动有 4 种活动状态，分别是：等待中、正在进行、成功、失败
实时活动在锁屏界面显示的时候，用户可以左划，点击清除按钮将其清除。用户没有清除的情况下，实时活动最多可以处于活动状态 8 小时，如果用户或应用程序尚未结束活动状态，系统会自动结束它。在此结束状态下，实时活动会在锁定屏幕上最多保留 4 个小时，最后系统会将其删除。

目前实时活动功能还在测试状态，开发者们还在为他们的 App 设计和测试这一项功能，下图是收集几款目前在测试中的实时活动的例子。
一些例子展示
关于实时活动这一功能的一些设想。在这个功能正式上线后，除了官方和大部分媒体提到的比赛比分、运动训练状态、行程状态、订单状态等这些功能以外，我们或许还可以看到这些功能：某餐饮 App 提醒你周四中午吃啥；原神体力、宝钱、参量质变仪到点提示上线领取；购物平台推送提醒商品抢购即将开启、正在抢购还剩余 69 件并且在不断减少等之类的功能。

以上就是关于实时活动这个功能的一些介绍和想法。之前的一篇锁屏天气的文章和视频会有评论说解锁在桌面小组件就能看到天气了啊，左划负一屏添加小组件就能看到天气了啊。不过对于我这种手机懒得解锁的用户来说，对于锁屏实时活动这个功能是非常期待的。大家对于实时活动这个系统特性及功能有什么想法和期待呢？</span>

                              <span>在我看来，Nreal Air 眼镜是一个非常「简单」、非常「聪明」的产品
包装大全套
拿到 Nreal Air 有几天时间了，老实讲等快递到那几天是很激动的，这不是我第一次使用 Nreal 眼镜了，在 2019 年的时候，我非常有幸去北京拜访过 Nreal，期间短暂的体验过 Nreal Air 的前身，当时的 demo 版本已经非常接近现在的样子，给我留下了非常深刻的印象。
如今，在我体验了一段时间，新鲜感消失之后，重新审视这个产品时，我觉得他们做了一些非常漂亮的取舍，得以让 Nreal Air 能够脱离小众，走向大众的视野。这在我的印象当中，可能是这个品类的第一次。并且在苹果发布他们的 AR 眼镜之前，分析一下 Nreal 的每一个选择背后的原因，想想苹果在面对取舍时会怎么选择，这是一个非常好的参照。

取舍
从用户端的需求来说，其实第一个选择非常简单：AR 眼镜到底能干什么？或者说我期望用户能用 AR 眼镜来做什么？
这个问题是简单的，但要回答清楚也是困难的。做产品定义时，产品经理大可以做一些「元宇宙」式的幻想：我希望 AR 眼镜是信息的入口，用户可以活在里面。这个回答可能没错，但是稍微认清一些现实的话，做到这一步是要有非常多的前提的，「元宇宙」里面的内容谁来填充？芯片是否具备这么高的算力能够渲染出丰富的画面？光机是不是能把这些画面精细的显示出来？这几个灵魂拷问可能就连产业巨头都只能兼顾 1-2 个，更别提 Nreal 只是一个 2017 年成立的创业公司了。
所以结合现实，他们的答案是，优先把画面显示好，内容生态寻求合作伙伴补充。
在这个答案的背后，就是他们两个最重要产品取舍：
1. 不在眼镜里集成计算模块和电池，将计算的部分放进用户固有设备中，如手机、平板。
2. 不做无线投屏，采用有线链接，保证稳定性和低延迟

这么选择一个重要的好处就是成本直接少一大块，反映到实…</span>

背景
成为少数派 Matrix 作者已经两年有余。回想起在少数派发表的第一篇文章，也是因为征文活动「无限桌面」有感而发，简单介绍了一下当时身在国内，日夜颠倒网课学习时的桌面布置。两年过去了，我已经回到了美国，也从当时的学校毕业，进入到新的学校，开启了人生的一个新阶段。 
新闻传媒，英文名叫做「Journalism」，是一门专门学习新闻报道和写作的学科。而除了学校里开设的各类理论和实践课之外，最好的学习方法就是平时的阅读积累。在我将新闻传媒定为自己学习的方向之后，我便开始有意识地通过各种渠道获取内容，加深自己对于新闻事件的理解，同时也学习职业记者们的写作风格。几年下来，我也有了一套独属于自己的系统。这次少数派的征文主题是「数字文具盒」，那我也趁这个机会，聊一聊自己作为一个新闻传媒系的学生，是如何使用数字工具来搭建自己的阅读和写作系统的。
按照工具和媒体的性质，我把自己的「数字文具盒」简单分为四个步骤：获取内容，收集内容，处理内容，以及产出内容。
我的阅读与写作系统的简单流程图
获取内容
阅读理解新闻的第一步，当然是要找到优质的信息渠道。我目前常用的渠道主要有四个：传统媒体，播客，书籍，以及社交媒体。
传统媒体，指的就是规模大，存在时间久，以报道新闻为主要目的的媒体。我订阅的传统媒体有三家：纽约时报 New York Times，华尔街日报 The Wall Street Journal， 以及大西洋杂志 The Atlantic。 纽约时报作为美国发行量最大的报纸之一，文章质量有一定的保证，并且汇集了许多美国最知名的专栏作家。我每天都会阅读它的早间资讯 Morning Briefing 和 On Politics 两份 newsletter。但因为它的受众主要是美国的自由派人士，文章导向非常明显。而华尔街日报专注于商务人士，文章也偏向保守。大西…</span>

                              <span>实事求是 or 上纲上线
我已经很难有动力去解释和反驳，自从明确意识到某些人就是故意不实事求是好好说话，动辄上纲上线占道德制高点对你劈头盖脸一顿叨叨图一时嘴快。
我对一些框架设计的不合理提出尖锐批评和改善建议，我觉得这么做合情合理。然而某些人就是故意抓住所谓漏洞进行人身攻击、扣帽、批斗，试图把人搞臭然后踩上一万只脚。
为什么会有语言霸凌、网络暴力
人是生物，生物是基因载体，基因本就有追求优越性的需要，所以人本来就有存在感和优越感需求。
常人通常选择做利人利己之事，这里面自动隐含存在感和优越感，无需特意索取，
但如果体质易缺乏优越感，就特容易感到难受，随时急需优越感补给，于是就有了这类钻营来得快优越，
基于生物节能本能，无一例外摸索出最低成本最短路径 —— 网络霸凌 / 逞口舌之快 / 论人是非，
常见套路即，动辄臆想和放大某杠点（例如 阴谋 / 愚蠢 / 不够 / 不公），然后拿着这杠点抬杠锤人，
这过程自动将自己置于道德制高点，自动彰显自己的存在和优越。评论区点赞站队的人越多，就越是让路径得到强化，越来越依赖这种方式获来得快优越，越来越无底线，
不分青红皂白，上来就是贴标签，扣帽子，通过各种言外之意给人泼脏水，刻意营造一副此人是什么什么的形象，
在场其他同类见有人被欺辱，往往就像鲨鱼闻见血腥一样，冒头各种扮好人、扮目击者、扮高人、扮理中客，都来分一杯羹让自己嘴爽，不分白不分。
互联网创作者生存现状
网上多是不发声的常人和有动力抬杠锤人的人，所以就是在这样环境下，创作者开始变得圆滑，不再发表有观点、有态度、有逻辑的文章，而是顺着爱发表意见的人的心意，去除各种观点、态度、逻辑，让文章看起来 “对的东西” 好像都有提到，很容易让人感觉愉悦和舒服。
当下互联网无异于 “党同伐异、对人不对事” 的世界，很难再有人沉下心学习，上网冲浪无非就是在信息茧房中找认同、喷异端，以彰显自身的正…</span>

                              <span>Ktor官方对Ktor的描述是：
Create asynchronous client and server applications. Anything from microservices to multiplatform HTTP client apps in a simple way. Open Source, free, and fun!
创建异步客户端和和服务器应用，从微服务到多平台HTTP客户端应用程序都可以用一种简单的方式完成。开源、免费、有趣！
它具有轻量级+可扩展性强+多平台+异步的特性。
轻量级和可扩展性是因为它的内核比较简单，并且当需要一些功能的时候可以加入别的插件到项目中，并不会造成功能冗余。并且Ktor的扩展是使用插拔的方式，使用起来非常简单！
异步，Ktor内部是使用Kotlin协程来实现异步，这对于熟悉Kotlin的Android开发非常友好。
看到这里可能一头雾水，下面将用一个比较简单的例子来带大家入坑Ktor！等看完这篇文章之后就会对Ktor的这些特性有进一步的了解。

前言
很高兴遇见你~
众所周知，RxJava 是一个非常流行的第三方开源库，它能将复杂的逻辑简单化，提高我们的开发效率，一个这么好用的库，来让我们学习一下吧🍺
下面我抛出一些问题，如果你都知道，那么恭喜你，你对 RxJava 掌握的很透彻，如果你对下面这些问题有一些疑惑，那么你就可以接着往下看，我会由浅入深的给你讲解 RxJava，看完之后，这些问题你会非常明了
1、什么是观察者模式？什么是装饰者模式？
2、观察者模式，装饰者模式在 RxJava 中的应用？
3、RxJava map 和 flatMap 操作符有啥区别？
4、如果有多个 subscribeOn ，会是一种什么情况？为啥？
5、如果有多个 observeOn ，会是一种什么情况？为啥？
6、RxJava 框架流思想设计？
7、RxJava 的 Subject 是什么？
8、如何通过 RxJava 实现一个自己的事件总线？
一、设计模式介绍
我们先了解一下下面两种设计模式：
1、观察者模式
2、装饰者模式
1.1、观察者模式
1.1.1、观察者模式定义
简单的理解：对象间存在一种一对多的依赖关系，当一个对象的状态发生改变时，所有依赖于它的对象都会得到通知并被自动更新
1.1.2、观察者模式示例
//1、定义一个观察者的接口
interface Observer {
    /**
     * 接收事件的方法
     */
    fun onChange(o: Any)
}

//2、定义一个被观察者的接口
interface Observable {
    /**
     * 添加观察者
     */
    fun addObserver(observer: Obser…</span>

In this series, I&#x27;m developing several scripts to help in cleaning up my music collection. In the last article, I used the framework I created for analyzing the directory and sub-directories of music files and carried out the analysis with the fine open source JAudiotagger library to analyze the tags of the music files in the music directory and subdirectories. In this article, I will do a simpler job:
Use the framework we created in Part 1
Make sure each album directory has a cover.jpg class
Make a note of any other files in the album directory that aren&#x27;t FLAC, MP3 or OGG.
Music and metadata
If you haven&#x27;t read part 1 and part 2 of this series,…</span>

                              <span>今天来看个需求，如何判断 Activity 上面是否有弹窗，当然，简单的方式肯定有，例如在 Dialog  show 的时候记录一下，但这种方式不够优雅，我们需要一款更通用的判断方式。
Android 目前的弹窗有如下几种：
普通的应用窗口，如 Dialog
附加与普通窗口的子窗口，如 PopWindow
系统窗口，如 WindowManager type 在 FIRST_SYSTEM_WINDOW 与 LAST_SYSTEM_WINDOW 之间
通过图来简单来了解下 Window 和 View 的关系：

Activity 在 attach 阶段创建了 PhoneWindow，并将 AppToken 存储到 PhoneWindow 中，然后通过 createLocalWindowManager 创建了一个本地的 WindowManager，该实例是 WindowManagerImpl，构造传入的 parentWindow 为 PhoneWindow。在 onResume 阶段时，从 PhoneWindow 中获取 WindowManager 来 addView
Dialog 有自己的 PhoneWindow，但 Dialog 并没有从 PhoneWindow 中去 get WindowManager，而是直接使用 getSystemService 拿到 Activity 的 WindowManager 来 addView
PopWindow 内部是通过 getSystemService 来拿到 Activity WindowManager + 内置子窗口 type 来实现的弹框
方案 1、通过 mView 集合中的 Activity 区间来判断
从上面我们可以简单了解到，当前进程所有窗口 View，最终都会被存储到 WindowManagerGlobal 单例的 mVie…</span>

Compose的诞生
在2019年的谷歌IO大会上，Compose作为Android新一代UI开发亮相，因为声明式开发越来越流行了，对标IOS开发SwiftUi，Compose的立项也为Android开发新加了声明式ui的开发选项，在2021年7月1.0正式版本的诞生，也意味着Compose即将进入生产环节，国际app巨头Twitter就首当其冲，在新页面上用上了Compose
Compose好处
与传统的xml相比，Compose不仅吸收了其优点，摒弃了糟粕，还具有以下几个优点
声明式
兼容性
跨平台
布局效率




不同于传统的命令式，ui的刷新需要调用者主动调用刷新方法，比如TextView需要特定的setText进行文本变化，而compose在定义好声明状态后，由框架自主调用刷新，减少状态不一致
compose最低兼容到android api 21，不但可以在原来View体系中嫁接使用，也可以在compose中使用原来View体系的xml
跨平台，目前支持macos等多个平台，跨平台由Jetbrain团队在做，compose未来会实现ui多跨平台，同时也搭配逻辑跨平台KMM项目（有关kmm的以后有机会可以再说说，比起说跨平台，更不如说是多平台，因为编译出来的代码是直接符合原平台开发规范的，比如ios编译出来的就是framework），未来实现ui跟逻辑都跨平台也不在遥远
compose 是严格遵循LayoutNode的单次测量，不会出现View的多次测量导致的问题，在ui卡顿或者ui规范上，是非常重要的改进



因为Compose是Android团队与JetBrain在推，国内外的学习热情都挺好，目前国内也有不少大厂进行了尝试阶段，比如字节。

In my previous article, I created a framework for analyzing the directories and subdirectories of music files, using the groovy.File class, which extends and streamlines java.File and simplifies its use. In this article, I use the open source JAudiotagger library to analyze the tags of the music files in the music directory and subdirectories. Be sure to read the first article in this series if you intend to follow along.

背景
读博士的这些年，我每天都在获取各式各样的知识。大到学术论文，小到快捷指令的配置教程，每份知识都可能在未来某个时刻派上用场。我根据自己的习惯和需求建立了一套工作流，用来记录以及内化各类知识。我的目标是形成自己的个人数据库，方便未来随时的调用。
知识有不同的特点，调用场景也各不相同。下面的表格展示了我对知识的理解以及相应的分类。在这篇文章里，我将针对每个类型，介绍了我记录（和内化）这些知识的经验，以及使用到的工具。


知识类型知识特点例子
学术研究格式固定，密度高，需要原文阅读学术论文，演讲
系统性知识内容多，密度低，自上而下结构大学课程，教科书，出版书籍
非系统性知识碎片化知识，自下而上结构CSDN，网络文章，教学/科普 视频
信息只需记录，不需整理做饭教学视频，服务器配置流程代码


1. 学术研究
首先要讨论的是学术研究类的知识，代表的例子就是学术论文。可能是因为阅读论文都需要花费巨大的精力而且经常会查阅，我通常会对阅读过论文有印象。即便不一定记得所有的细节，我还是很容易就能检索到，并重新阅读。
学术论文这一类知识有三个特点：

知识密度高：文章内容很浓缩，比较难再二次总结。未来通常需要再查阅论文的时候大概率还是得阅读原文。
格式固定：学术论文通常都会有 Abstract 来记录文章梗概。理工科的论文经常会有 Related Work, Methodology 和 Results 这些章节。第一次阅读难度较大，但理解以后再次阅读的难度不大，信息获取容易。
上下文重要：随意从论文中抽出来某一段文字或者配图，不一定很好理解。通常需要结合上下文才好理解。

由于查阅论文的大多需要阅读原文，所以我不会专门用笔记 app 给论文记笔记。我会把笔记直接记在论文 PDF 上。

概述
最近线上监控发现 OOM 涨幅较大，因此去尝试定位和修复这个问题，在修复了一些内存泄漏和大对象占用问题后, OOM 依旧未达到正常标准，在这些新上报的 hprof 文件中，发现几乎所有 case 中都有个叫 FinalizerReference 的对象，数量巨多，内存占用高居首位，因此判断它就是引起本次 OOM 上涨的罪魁祸首。

ReferenceQueue
首先前置了解下 ReferenceQueue 引用队列是个啥，简言之就是用来存放 Reference 对象的队列，当 Reference 对象所引用的对象被 GC 回收时，该 Reference 对象就会被加入到引用队列 ReferenceQueue 中。即：
val queue &#x3D; ReferenceQueue()
val bean &#x3D; Bean()
val reference &#x3D; SoftReference(bean, queue)

上述代码中创建了一个 bean 强引用，以及一个 reference 软引用，当 bean 被回收时，该软引用 reference 对象会被放到 queue 队列中，后续该 reference 对象需要开发者自行处理(如从队列中 poll 等)。
Leakcanary 检测内存泄漏的原理就是应用的 ReferenceQueue 引用队列，以 Activity 为例：
监听 Activity 的生命周期。
在 onDestory 的时候，通过 ReferenceQueue 来创建对应 Actitity 的 Refrence 引用对象。
一段时间后，从 ReferenceQueue 中读取，如果有这个 Actitity 的 Refrence，那么说明这个 Activity 的 Refrence 已经被…</span>

                              <span>概述
平时开发遇到一些问题，比如
怎么确认引入的第三方so是否适配32/64位
怎么知道第三方库申请了那些权限
每次开发引入的图片怎么一键压缩并自动引入项目内，并且每次使用不会重复压缩
每次写项目都会创建shape,而这个shape很可能同事写过我不知道又写了一遍，很可能一个项目中存在很多重复的shape，只是命名不同，该如何找到这些重复的shape
针对上方问题，再结合gradle插件开发了一个插件工具，可以解决这些问题，在这里分享出来，希望可以帮助到更多人
使用
引入库
在根目录的build.gradle 引入
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath &quot;com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.2.2&quot;
        //引入这个库
        classpath &quot;io.githunb.renxh4:compress_png:0.0.5&quot;
    }
}

在app的build.gradle引入插件
apply plugin: &#x27;com.ren.xh.plugin&#x27;

xh{
    tinifyId &#x3D; &quot;wQdHz6dkJhtSCt0sHwCmvQh5lpSMcyL1&quot;
}

引入插件后，需要配置tinifyId,因为这里使用的是https://tinify.cn/ 进行压缩的图片，需要到这个网站申请一个开发者id，仅需要俩步就可以轻松申请

使用库
检测so适配
命令行执行命令 ./gradlew checkso

./gradlew checkso

从原始的Android开始，系统就支持设置两种方式的壁纸，一种是静态壁纸，另一种是动态壁纸。
静态壁纸
静态壁纸没什么好说的，通过系统提供的API一行代码就完事了。
最简单代码如下所示。
val wallpaperManager &#x3D; WallpaperManager.getInstance(this)
try {
    val bitmap &#x3D; ContextCompat.getDrawable(this, R.drawable.ic_launcher_background)?.toBitmap()
    wallpaperManager.setBitmap(bitmap)
} catch (e: Exception) {
    e.printStackTrace()
}

除了setBitmap之外，系统还提供了setResource、setStream，一共三种方式来设置静态壁纸。
三种方式殊途同归，都是设置一个Bitmap给系统API。
动态壁纸
动态壁纸就有点意思了，很多手机ROM也内置了一些动态壁纸，别以为这些是什么新功能，从Android 1.5开始，就已经支持这种方式了。只不过做的人比较少，为啥呢，主要是没有什么特别合适的场景，而且动态壁纸，会比静态壁纸更加耗电，所以大部分时候，我们都没用这种方式。
壁纸作为一个系统服务，在系统启动时，不管是动态壁纸还是静态壁纸，都会以一个Service的形式运行在后台——WallpaperService，它的Window类型为TYPE_WALLPAPER，WallpaperService提供了一个SurfaceHolder来暴露给外…</span>

最近，我正在研究使用 Obsidian，想看看大名鼎鼎的「卡片盒笔记法」是否真的能解决我读书过目就忘的困扰。不过困扰还不知道能不能解决，我就发现了新的问题。
Obsidian 有许多优点，其中一个就是自带社区主题库，用户可以随意更换样式，不再天天看千篇一律的外观。然而，尽管社区主题库里有很多主题样式，说实话，没有一个能百分之百令我满意的。
比如「Things」这个主题，我很喜欢它的简洁风格，但是它每一级的标题颜色却似乎并不遵循某种规律，甚至莫名其妙地在二级标题下多出了一条下划线，这一点让完美主义的我无比介意。

我明白，主题风格毕竟只是制作者的个人喜好，肯定是做不到让所有使用者都百分之百满意的。那么，有没有什么办法，可以让我自己来自定义主题呢？
答案是有的，Obsidian 设置中的「CSS 代码片段」这个功能就是为用户对外观进行自定义而准备的。

HTML 与 CSS
Obsidian 的外观本质上是由 CSS 代码所决定的。
我们可以打开 Obsidian 的窗口，按下 Ctrl + Shift + I，即可开启开发者工具（Developer Tools），这个操作和在浏览器中开启开发者工具是一样的，展示出来的也同样是 HTML 文档。

HTML，全称「HyperText Markup Language」，又称为「超文本标记语言」，它的作用就是告诉浏览器这个网页该怎么渲染，比如这段文字是一级标题，这一段文字是正文，而这一段文字是链接，可以跳转别的网页。
听起来和 Obsidian 所使用的 Markdown 很像。没错，M…</span>

相信许多普通用户都在用着M-ATX规格的主板，这也是颇具性价比的装机方案之一，毕竟追求极致性能也是需要口袋中有充足的氪金。但很有意思的是，虽然我们用着M-ATX规格主板，但机箱却多为ATX塔式。就如同我一样，给自己整了一个大机箱，装着一块M-ATX主板，美其名曰多出的空间散热更好。但说实话，机箱的散热效率还是要看风道设计，并不是箱子越大越好。

目前市面上M-ATX规格机箱并没有太多的新意，不是全侧透就是双侧透，有些外观甚至只差一个厂家LOGO，可选的机箱造型并不多，说是属于“缩小版”的ATX塔式机箱也不为过。对于我这种想减少光渲染又不想完全损失光影的玩家来说，确实很难抉择。

不过幸好最近华硕新推出了一款M-ATX规格机箱--华硕ASUS PRIME AP201冰立方机箱。初看商品介绍页面并没太大感觉，但翻了几篇买家秀后，发现设计感贼给力。接下来就聊聊我的换机体验，希望给各位小伙伴带来一些参考。

来自PRIME大师系列

当我将机箱换成华硕ASUS PRIME AP201冰立方机箱（以下简称华硕AP201冰立方机箱）并开机后，原先十分耀眼的光污染瞬间变得柔和起来。

关掉室内灯光后，整个华硕AP201冰立方机箱的光效就如同穿上了一套薄纱，内部的硬件会随着RGB灯效若隐若现，附加了一种神秘，确实有一种立方体的既视感。

从正上方看去，水冷风扇光影透过散热孔散出，被分割成具有像素风的格纹，经过切割的光影既复古又有奇幻的感觉。

而在光线充足的环境中，光影又并不会透出多少，朦胧中充满了低调，颇具内涵。

实际上华硕AP201冰立方机箱的内部自成天地，光影被拉得很足，离光污染全开之间也只差一个机盖开启动作。

外观小巧，却“大”有来头

华硕AP201冰立方机箱的外包装比较低调简洁，产品的特色描述并不算多，注明了支持360mm水冷，338mm显卡和ATX电源。

前言
很高兴遇见你~
在本系列的上一篇文章中，我们介绍了 Flutter 特点以及一些常用的 Widget：MaterialApp，Scaffold，AppBar，Center，Container，Text。还没有看过上一篇文章的朋友，建议先去阅读 Flutter 系列（三）：Flutter 特点及常用 Widget 介绍。接下来我们继续对 Flutter Widget 进行学习
下面我会通过：效果展示 -&gt; Widget 讲解 -&gt; 代码实现的方式对 Widget 进行介绍，最后在通过 Widget 组合编写一个综合的案例
一、Flutter Widget 之 Image
Image 是 Flutter 给我们提供显示图片的 Widget
先看一眼使用 Image 实现的效果
1.1、Image 效果展示

刘亦菲的圆形图片😄，美爆了。言归正传，大家可以先想一下怎么去实现？
1.2、Image 介绍
Image 组件有很多构造方法，这里给大家讲两个常用的：
1、Image.network ：加载远程图片
2、Image.asset ：加载本地图片
上面这两个属于 Image 的命名构造方法，对命名构造方法还不熟悉的赶紧先去看一下我的另一篇文章传送门
1.2.1、Image.network 加载远程图片
import &#x27;package:flutter/material.dart&#x27;;

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(

起因于自己想研究一下 game-engine，但是主流的 ue 什么的太过庞大了（庞大也是必然），于是想到了比较亲切的 Flutter Engine（其实也蛮复杂的），于是想梳理一下其 启动 和 绘制 的大概流程。
开始
注意， Flutter Engine 也相当庞大，由于精力有限，只能梳理部分内容。
Flutter Engine - Github
在开始之前，列举一下相关的代码文件夹
fml （基础功能的封装，比如基于task 的线程，log，时钟，路径，哈希等 很底层很硬核的东西）
shell/common （直接引用 shell.h 注释的一句话：Perhaps the single most important class in the Flutter engine repository.）
shell/runtime （不同平台对 embedder engine 具体实现）
impeller （图形后端，也就是roadmap 提到的在重构东西，你会发现它的 commit 时间最近，还带了好多个⚠️）
启动
Flutter 有几个线程？ 首先排除单线程，再排除经常看到的 5 线程模型（其实没啥问题）。 为什么皮这一下，因为实际情况可能比你想象的复杂的多，举两个例子：你在 Dart 开了一个 Compute Isolate，并且愉快的使用 fronted-server 提供的 hot-reload，这下情况就复杂了吧。
言归正传，我们从官方的 examples/vulkan_glfw 例子进行分析（我接触的时候当时只有一个 glfw-opengl 的例子，令人感概）
如何启动 Fluuter Engine ？

Notion、Obsidian、Logseq、Roam Research、Evernote、flomo、为知、飞书、语雀……知识管理/笔记软件越来越多，我总在不同应用间徘徊。直到有次忽然醒悟，知识管理软件不是管理知识，而是管理笔记。笔记里的知识并不属于你，只有经过消化、应用，才会成为自己的知识。
这么简单的事，我之前却一直没看透，总是把笔记与知识理解划上了等号。当要用到曾摘录的笔记时，就在各类知识管理软件里翻找，折腾一番才找到需要的笔记，有时甚至出现「自己不清楚放在哪里，也不清楚是否有」的情况。记笔记花了一个小时，下次寻找与重新消化又花了一个小时，原本为效率而生的知识管理软件变成了浪费时间的杀手。
另一方面，我们在用知识管理软件的美观界面和强大功能的同时，也被这些软件所限制，无法完全按自己的想法输出笔记。比如，你长了一双翅膀，Markdown 文本是自由的天地，而进入 Notion 则被隔成一个个小房间，你在房间里待着很舒服，可一旦想去其他房间，就必须脱离 block，不比 Markdown 可以自由飞翔。

突破迷思后，我基于 VuePress 和 vuepress-theme-hope 建立了 LearnData 项目，把知识笔记、生活记录、博客和任何觉得有价值的记录转成 Markdown 文本，然后推送到 GitHub 生成 Pages 静态页面，同步到国内云服务器形成 LearnData - 开源学习笔记。

LearnData 的笔记/文章编辑均使用 Markdown，输出不再受到应用的局限。同时，LearnData …</span>

                              <span>前言
2022年是新能源车国补的收尾年，随着销量提升，纯电新能源车品牌不断增多，可选性逐渐增大，价格也不断攀升。 

新能源车最完美的使用环境就是有家用充电桩的日常通勤，享受每公里0.05元以下的电费成本，每天到家就能补足电量，即不产生里程焦虑，也极大程度降低出行成本。
早年新能源车标配充电桩，如今随着价格的提高，充电桩成为了重点阉割项目，不说早早就卖8000的特斯拉，今年的小鹏、问界、沃尔沃都不再赠送充电桩，未来越来越多的厂商会加入这一行列。
7KW充电桩或成为未来主流
虽然我个人认为家用申请380V电表，安装21KW充电桩是拓展性最好的极优解，但目前随着环境的改变，未来大部分国人的家充桩都会是220V 7KW的家用桩。 

首先是电网的审批层面，上海地区的国家电网已经于今年停止了380V充电桩电表的新装报批，目前国网只为新能源车主开放220V电表，最大功率7KW的申请渠道。
这是因新能源车增多而出现的必然趋势，国内未来势必会逐渐取消380V电表用于充电。 

第二是对于交流充电而言，家用充电桩是带有保护装置的连接件，充电过程发生于车载充电机，最快交流充电速度由充电机决定，目前国内在售交流充电速率最高的是16KW，搭载在Model S与Model X两台百万级豪车上，一般大众款新能源车，没有这样的高功率电机。 

理想、威马、蔚来、比亚迪、埃安、荣威等主流的新能源车品牌的核心车型，基本都是内置7KW充电机，不支持11KW三相电来交流充电，所以对于很多车主，7KW充电桩已经是顶配了。
最后是7KW交流充电的表现，以谷时点8小时计算，可以为车辆补充56度电，目前市面大部分家用中小型纯电新能源车的能耗在每度电6~7公里，折算一夜谷时可以补电300~350公里，完全可以狠狠开上一整天。
所以，因为政策、热销车辆和7KW充电桩家充综合体验来看，220V 7KW的家充桩或将是未来家庭…</span>

作为一个法学生，我的日常生活主要围绕在上课、论文、实习以及我杂七杂八的爱好上。今天在这里跟大家聊一聊我是如果进行任务管理的。
我的任务管理系统
软件的选择
从2017年接触滴答清单以来，滴答清单变得功能越来越丰富。熟悉这款软件的人都知道，如今的滴答清单已经不单单是一款Todo  List软件了，而是一款融合日历、笔记、清单、习惯打卡、番茄钟的“综合性”软件。
我相信大多数的“少数派”们都是“Less is more”的坚实簇拥者，看到现在的滴答清单一定也会和我一样不自觉的想起国产的印象笔记，觉得这是一款什么都做却又什么都做不好的软件。因此从2017年接触这款软件后，我很快又转向了Things、Omnifocus、Todoist、Anydo、2Do、微软Todo、Reminder……
不夸张的说，从2016年接触GTD概念后的我，基本用过市面上各式各样的GTD软件，但是时隔多年，2016年的我刚刚进入大学，如今的我研究生也已经快要毕业了，在经历过不同环境下各种工作流的转换，兜兜转转我还是回到了滴答清单，原因无他，唯性价比高、满足我的需求、稳定矣。
化繁为简
虽然现在的滴答清单功能复杂，但好在这款软件还是给我们“Less is more”的选择，即仅选择我们用得到的功能，隐藏那些我们用不到的功能
滴答清单的功能模块隐藏
就我个人而言，我把滴答清单仅作为我的Todo List和日历，因此也就只选择了这两个功能模块。除了能够隐藏部分“功能”，在滴答清单里，还能够做到隐藏“视图”、“标签”等，将“Less is more”的观点贯彻到底，对于显示什么，不显示什么给了我们非常大的自主权。

下面我就来讲讲我具体是怎样使用滴答清单来处理我的日常生活的。

                              <span>越来越受欢迎的白板工具
最近几年市面上出现了很多白板工具应用，白板顾名思义就是在手机、平板、或者电脑上模拟现实生活中白板的应用。
白板应用从产品设计的角度来讲及其简单，因为白板应用的的概念模型足够简单——就是一张白纸、或者办公室放着的一块白板。
如果仅从概念模型上来看，白板应用似乎没啥可做的，你只需要写一个白板，然后做一个手写功能就可以了。
那么为什么市面上还是有那么多的白板应用呢？以及决定一款白板应用好不好用，我们是不是有什么样的评价标准呢？
对于这个问题，我想说的是，在保证使用体验的前提下，工具产品本身是没有好坏之分的，评判一款工具产品好不好其实没有意义，工具产品只能基于你的使用场景，评判适不适合。所以基于这个逻辑，我使用一个框架对市面上的白板应用进行了一个简单的分类。

 
在纵向，我根据使用场景来进行划分，就是你使用白板更多的时候是个人使用，还是需要和别人协作？
在横坐标上，我使用白板本身的功能性来进行划分，目前市面上的白板应用在功能性层面主要分为两类，第一类主打真实书写体验，无限书写区域，完全书写自由度，第二类则主打提供模块化的组件，弱化书写体验，强化沟通模版的白板应用。
从这种分类方式可以发现，其实个人的更偏向于自由度高的，而协作的更偏向于模块化的，为什么呢？
因为这和实际的工作场景是匹配的，个人使用白板，无论怎么发散书写，书写的信息的上下文都在个人脑中。但如果是协作场景的话，沟通的效率就变得至关重要，所以一些通用的，模块化的，标准化的沟通方法可以让所有对一个事情的认知都对齐，这种方法本质上是弱化了个人化的表达方式，用更标准的沟通方式来提升沟通效率。
也许以上分类方法并不是一定合理，但就目前我自己用起来是OK的。
在聊具体的白板应用之前我想，先聊一个问题。
为什么白板这么好用？

                              <span>「第二份简历」
首先解释一下这个「第二份」是什么意思。我通常喜欢把在大四校招时使用的简历称作「第一份简历」，因为那是你踏入社会的第一步，是你第一次将自己的经历通过简历来展示。往后跳槽、换工作使用的简历都可以称作「第二份」，它代表着你已经是一个成熟的社会人，有足够的社会、工作经验。
那么就让我们先回看一下「第一份简历」我们都会写一些什么。我们在写校招简历的时候，通常会涉及到的内容为以下几点。

专业课分数 / 绩点
奖惩情况
兼职情况
在校期间参与的项目（可以是学校的实验，也可以是兼职参与的项目）
在校期间所任职务

这五点足够展现你在大学四年的能力，让校招企业充分了解你。因为能够参与校招的企业，都知道你不会有正式的工作经历，自然也没参与过社会上的工作项目。企业人事对参与校招的学生大多抱着「该生是否有培养空间」的态度来面对。因此在写校招简历的时候上面五点只需要充分体现你的潜力就足以吸引到大部分校招企业。
来到「第二份简历」，这个时候你面对的 HR ，不再会把你当作初出茅庐的应届毕业生，而是一个有着社会工作经验的求职者。HR 对求职者的要求也非常简单明了，即「你是否能为公司创造价值」。这个「价值」可以是短期内的，也可以是长远角度的，具体看 HR 怎么定位你的职位。但是有一点是不变的，那就是上面提到的，你不再是学生，你只是「求职者」。
如何写「第二份简历」
「第二份简历」相比「第一份简历」，会有不少内容上的变化。首先是不再着重于在校情况的描写，而是着墨于当前或者上段工作经历的一个梳理与细致归纳。不要简单概括，而是要将内容详细写出来。同时，在现公司或者前公司所做的项目，也要有个清晰的描写。
工作经历

                              <span>最近我们发布了一款全新的笔记产品——Neatfiy。（https://neatifyapp.com/）
正如其名，Neat（整洁）ify（化），Neatify 的初衷是编辑整洁清晰的结构化笔记，比起很快速的随手记备忘录，它适用于知识的管理、周期性的写作总结...之类的场景。
如左图
在大约去年年底的时候，我们立下了一个 Flag——我们要将专注笔记进行一次重构。 Neatify 就是我们拿出来的结果。下面不简单地聊一下，我们在这个路上的一些思考，以及集中回答一些朋友提出的疑问：

很多人对于 Neatify 的第一个疑问，就是为什么我们团队要出两款很相似的两款产品？

专注笔记，是我们第一款推出的笔记软件。也是我们团队首次接触「笔记」软件的开始，虽然我们自己也很喜欢专注笔记，它有很多很有用的功能及体验，比如结构化的目录、清晰的标注阅读体验。
但确实我们是第一次做笔记软件，前期很多没想清楚的地方，因此做了很多没什么用、甚至很负面的一些设计。这些是一些很沉重的历史包袱。如果我们还背着沉重的历史包袱，我们在优化的过程中就显得被束缚住了。
很显然的是，我们在这三年多的积累里，最重要的不是我们写过了什么代码，而是积累了很多很多的经验。所以我们这次，希望是抛开一切已有的东西，去构思一款自己心目中最理想的笔记产品应该是怎样的。这就是 Neatify。
在 Neatfiy 上面，我们并没有很刻意地去增加很多的功能，来让它看上去有很明显被“改版升级”的感觉，甚至做了很多的减法，比如：
1、把笔记本、子页面等层级都砍了，只保留文件夹 → 页面这样的结构，因为在使用专注笔记的时候，我们总在纠结，这样的层级关系，我们应该使用笔记本呢？还是子页面呢？还是文件夹呢？它们之间的作用太相似了，在每次使用的时候都要思考很久，这是意见很“反效率”的事情。
2、把很多花里胡哨的功能去了，比如各种各样的视图啊之类…</span>

软件的选择与流程的建立
在漫长的学习之路上，我遇到了学习软件，它们和我磨合、指导我的学习、被我不断的筛选。在这个过程中我逐渐有了一些想法来选择软件，并最终建立流程。
软件的主要特性-一切的基础
我也许从来都是一个缺少方法的人，直到软件进入我的生活，与其说它们是工具，不如说它们是我的一部分关于学习的性格。 我从不对软件硬性要求，要求它符合我的工作流程或是符合我的方法论，我对它们抱有了更大的期望，我对那些能做我以前做不到的事的软件抱有期望，因为它们的价值是难以衡量的。 于是我要求它有某种特性，可以与我使用的软件区别出来，完成我曾经难以完成的工作。
方法论-以实际的场景体现
软件的诞生一开始就会被打上开发者的烙印，就像是同样的教科书，不同的主编会有不同的侧重一样。如果一个软件有着鲜明的主要功能特色那它几乎一定体现着某种思想，但是方法论存在着问题，就是难以证伪，越是想用思想捏合成一座大厦最后会发现地基可能都是不牢的。那么如何使用方法论呢？
1. 与科学接轨，学习有关知识；对信息源可信度进行筛选
2. 在使用中验证方法论，最好有一定程度的量化
3. 简化抽象方法论，细化具体方法论不至于在臃肿中走向模糊
4. 重视全面和逻辑性 
扯远了，在软件的方法论验证中，重要的无疑是第二条。 如何验证呢，就是在它主张的场景使用它（或仅仅是想象使用），注意它的价值，这是我认为最好的方式，一个好的软件应该是向你描绘了一个出色高效的使用过程。 另一种方法是看受人欢迎的软件，某种意义上来说它的有效经过了人的验证，注意它的独特性即可。
软件的使用与功能的解构
当我们使用一款软件，很多情况下并不是按照作者给出的使用场景进行使用，但这不意味着这种使用是错误的，因为开发者不可能列出所有的使用场景，也与你的面对的场景不尽相同。了解软件的边界重点在于对其功能的理解。
