SpaceX’s satellite internet service Starlink will soon be available on select airplanes with the official launch of Starlink Aviation next year, the company has announced. It claims the service will offer internet speeds of up to 350Mbps to each plane equipped with its Aero Terminal, which it says is fast enough for video calls, online gaming, “and other high data rate activities.” 
It’s certainly a big leap up from the typical speeds offered by most in-flight Wi-Fi. OneZero reports that most flights either use air-to-ground systems which top out at around 10Mbps per flight (and only work while flying over land), while current satellite systems typically offer between 30Mbps and 100Mbps. Since these speeds are per plane, actual speeds...

Lyft users can now search, reserve, and pay for parking spaces from the app in cities across the US, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. Drivers can access the new Lyft Parking feature by tapping the steering wheel icon located on the bottom-right corner of the Lyft app, according to Lyft’s website.
The parking reservation feature is made possible by a partnership between Lyft and SpotHero, a Chicago-based parking company, and is available through both the iOS and Android versions of the Lyft app.

      The Lyft parking feature will show available spaces with pricing, much like a hotel reservation.
  

The SpotHero service is available in over 300 cities across the US and Canada but it’s unclear which...

Logitech has released an updated version of its Crayon stylus to coincide with the announcement of Apple’s new iPads. The new stylus costs the same as the old model, $69.95, but now features a USB-C charging port rather than Lightning — a helpful change given the 10th-generation iPad’s switch from Lightning to USB-C. 
The change means that the Logitech Crayon arguably has a much more elegant charging mechanism than Apple’s first-party $99 Pencil when used with the base-level iPad. Logitech’s new stylus can charge using just the USB-C cable that comes with the tablet — no fiddly USB-C-to-Lightning adapter required. The wirelessly-charging second-generation Apple Pencil isn’t compatible with Apple’s new entry-level iPad.

You describe the application’s functionality (API endpoints, authorization, deployment, etc.) in a single file. The compiler does the rest itself. The result is a full-fledged web app built with Node + React, created in a few minutes.
We&#x27;ve opted in for HacktoberFest, and it has already brought us tremendous results! Ten merged PRs from the external contributors, six are in progress, and more to come! It&#x27;s a huge step forward for the project! Not only in terms of the amount of work done. But also the user engagement and general feedback. Definitely a huge win for us!

If you&#x27;re still thinking about whether you need to join HacktoberFest or not -- you definitely should while there&#x27;s still time! 
P.S: And if you&#x27;d like to join us as a contributor -- click here! 
P.P.S: Only 63 stars left until 2,000 on Github! Please star Wasp if you haven&#x27;t yet 😄 🐝</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone!
The newsletter is late: a new React RFC gave me a lot of reading 😄 The article by Kent C. Dodds is quite long as well but worth it. We&#x27;ve got 2 articles highlighting Sandpack in 2 weeks, it&#x27;s probably worth looking into!
It&#x27;s moving well on the React-Native core side too, with new open discussions. We could even think that after the migration to the new architecture and the stabilization of public APIs, there could be a 1.0 release? It doesn&#x27;t matter much in practice, but some apparently care deeply about having a major version.
There are also quite a few interesting new things in the frontend ecosystem. I&#x27;m particularly interested in Codeflow, Fontaine and Unplugin which may be of direct interest to Docusaurus.

npm is a package manager for Node.js. It is used to install and manage packages for your JavaScript projects. npm is open source and was initially released in 2009. The npm repository is a collection of open-source packages and tools for Node.js.
npm version


Let&#x27;s quickly check the version of npm that we are using:
npm -v

# Output:
8.11.0

If you don&#x27;t see the version number, you need to install npm first:
Downloading and installing Node.js and npm
npm packages


Once you have installed npm, you can check the versions of the installed packages for your project:
npm list

The output will look something like this depending on the installed packages:
├── adonis-preset-ts@2.1.0
├── luxon@2.1.1
├── pg@8.7.1
├── pino-pretty@7.2.0
├── proxy-addr@2.0.7
├── reflect-metadata@0.1.13
├── source-map-support@0.5.20
├── typescript@4.2.4
├── youch-terminal@1.1.1

npm package globally


The -g flag is used to check the global packages. The output will be the same as the output of the npm list command, except that it will only show the global packages.
npm list -g

Example output:
├── @cloudflare/wrangler@1.19.8
├── @stackbit/cli@0.2.30
├── npm@8.12.1
├── pg@8.7.3
└── typescript@4.6.4

If you want to check not only the versions of your packages but also their dependencies, you can use the --depth option:
npm list --depth&#x3D;1

This will show you the versions of your packages and their dependencies.
You can also check the version of a specific package by adding the package name to the command:
npm list pg

Output:
└─┬ pg@8.7.1
  └─┬ pg-pool@3.4.1
    └── pg@8.7.1 deduped

Using the npm list command is a good way to check the versions of the installed packages.
For more information on what the latest version of a package is, you can use the npm info 
 command.

https://aws.amazon.com/jp/about-aws/whats-new/2022/10/aws-parameters-secrets-lambda-extension/
This extension can be used to retrieve parameters from the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store and secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager.
Until now, parameters and secrets were obtained in the Lambda function process using the AWS SDK or other means. 
With this extension, these values can be cached and reused during the lifecycle of a Lambda function. This reduces the latency and cost of retrieving parameters and secrets.
Please refer to each documents for details.

Localization is the process of converting web and app content from one form (text content) to another (a different language), making applications more accessible to users by addressing language barriers.
There are many localization testing tools available today, but most are expensive, limited to a particular framework or language and/or require learning a new interface. Tolgee is an open source application that can be used to manage the localization process; it is platform-agnostic and can handle screenshots, comment translations, tag keys, and automated screenshots generation for the web.

Tolgee supports a variety of libraries and frameworks to perform localization. You can find details in Tolgee&#x27;s official documentation with instructions for using each library or framewo…</span>

So you have decided to get started with speaking at tech conferences? Congrats, making this decision is already really brave! 🎉
If you don’t instantly have a topic in mind that you would like to talk about, this part is for you. Let’s explore how to come up with topics and what your options are here. 
Talk about …
… what you know
…something you care about
Get inspired
Your are not an island

Answer the public
answer the public might be for you. Find out what people want to know by entering any topic into their search bar and see what requests are made about this on Google. You can browse among questions, look for comparisons or even related searches to a topic of your choice. 
These are just some of the many ways to come up with topics for conference talks. Once you get started, you will be surprised on how many different topics you can come up with if you stop your inner perfectionist from slowing you down. And remember: it doesn’t have to be super technical at all. Many meetups and conferences are also happy to accept ‘meta’ or ‘cultural’ topics and you don’t always have to do live coding to wow your audience. 
How do you come up with topics to talk about? Do you have a strategy to brainstorm ideas or do topics just magically come to you when trying to fall asleep? I’m super curious how other folks do it 🙌</span>

Vala is an object-oriented programming language with a syntax very similar to C#.
The current version is 0.56, meanwhile I used the 0.54.1.
The language has been born in 2006 and altrought it hasn&#x27;t reach the version 1.0 it&#x27;s used in a lot of GNOME applications and it&#x27;s the main choice for implementing application in Elementary OS. 
I&#x27;m interested in the creation of GTK applications for Linux.
Use C, but I use it only for an exam in my first university years. I was afraid to not reach a concrete result in a short time.
Use Python, probably the simple solution, but I was interested in creating a native application.
Use Go, but my perception is that the GTK libraries for Go were immature and incomplete.

                              <span>NFS açılımıyla Network File System, dosyalarımızı ağ üzerinden paylaşmamıza olanak sağlayan bir sistemdir. NFS kullanarak sunucu olan bilgisayarda paylaşılan dizinleri client olan bilgisayarlara mount edebiliriz. 
Mount işlemini gerçekleştirmek için en iki makinaya ihtiyacımız var, bunlardan biri NFS server ve diğerleri de sunucuya bağlamak istediğimiz client makinalar olabilir.
sudo apt update

sudo apt upgrade

Sırasıyla yukarıdaki komutları çalıştırarak sisteminizin ve içlerindeki paketleri güncelleyebilirsiniz.
Aşağıdaki komutu çalıştırıyoruz.

sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server


Eğer paylaşmak istediğiniz dizin zaten sunucunuzda varsa, bu adımı atlayabilirsiniz. Yoksa mkdir komutunu kullanarak oluşturabilirsiniz.
mkdir /Data

Dizini oluşturduktan sonra içerisine istediğiniz verileri ekleyebilirsiniz. Şimdilik aşağıdaki komutu kullanarak deneme.txt adındaki dosyayı oluşturabilirsiniz.
touch /Data/deneme.txt

Nano editörünü kullanrak deneme.txt dosyasının içeriğini düzenleyebilirsiniz.
nano deneme.txt

Exports dosyasında, NFS sunucusuna hangi makinanın hangi yetkilerle erişlebileceği konfigrasyonunu yapıyoruz.
nano /etc/exports

dosyanın içeriğini aşağıdaki gibi kendinize göre düzenleyebilirsiniz.
/    ()

Örnek gösterecek olursak
/Data   192.168.2.100(rw,sync)

Ayrıca aşağıdaki gibi IP aralığına da paylaşabilirsiniz
/Data 192.168.2.0/24(rw,sync)

Yukarıda Parantez içerisinde belirttiğimiz rw, belirtilen ip veya ip aralığındaki client makinaların dosya üzerinde read ve write işlemlerini yapabileceklerini belirtiyor.

systemctl restart nfs-server



systemctl enable nfs-server</span>

If you need to simultaneously use multiple caching engines or want to switch between them, UniCache is the tool for you. It allows you to switch between Memcached, Redis and in-memory caching engines as per your choice. Moreover, you need not worry about breaking code changes when updating Redis / Memcached base libraries.

UniCache is a very convenient and helpful tool for developers. Whether it&#x27;s handling 3 cache engines together or migrating between them, try UniCache - it&#x27;s 3x faster!

Go check it out!

                              <span>这是 Xubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu 及其新功能的快速总结。




质量需要时间来建立。它适用于生活的各个方面，包括软件。

自 Xfce 4.16 发布以来，Xfce 4.17（开发版）已经被添加了许多新功能。这包括核心 Xfce、原生应用，GNOME 43、MATE 1.26 和 libadwaita。由于 Xfce 也是 GNOME 和 MATE 的组合，正确地合并和测试这些更改需要时间。

在 Xubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu 版本中，你将体验到自 2020 年 12 月以来所做的所有改进：将近两年的错误修复和增强。

让我们快速查看一下时间表。目前，Xubuntu 22.10 beta 已经发布，并正在测试中（本问末尾提供了 ISO 链接）。最终版本预计于 2022 年 10 月 20 日发布。

Xubuntu 22.10 新功能

核心更新和 GNOME 框架

在其核心，Xubuntu 22.10 同其基于的 Ubuntu 22.10 一样，采用 Linux 内核 5.19。另外，Xfce 桌面版本是 Xfce 4.17。

4.17 版本是一个开发版，因为它是下一个大版本 Xfce 4.18 的基础，该版本 计划在今年圣诞节发布。

让我们谈谈 GNOME 和相关应用。 Xubuntu 22.10 中的 Xfce 4.17 首次获得了带有 GNOME 43 更新的 libadwaita。这意味着默认的 GNOME 应用程序可以在 Xfce 桌面下正确呈现。

这就是说，GNOME 软件应用Software 43 在 Xubuntu 22.10 的 Xfce 桌面下看起来很棒。如果你将其与 Xfce 原生外观和带有 CSD/SSD（例如 “磁盘应用Disk”）的 GNOME 应用进行比较，它…</span>

微服务架构的强大之处在于它的多语言性。企业将其功能分解为一组微服务，每个团队自由选择一个平台。

我们的用户管理系统已经分解为四个微服务，分别是添加、查找、搜索和日志服务。添加服务在 Java 平台上开发并部署在 Kubernetes 集群上，以实现弹性和可扩展性。这并不意味着其余的服务也要使用 Java 开发，我们可以自由选择适合个人服务的平台。

让我们选择 Python 作为开发查找服务的平台。查找服务的模型已经设计好了（参考 2022 年 3 月份的文章），我们只需要将这个模型转换为代码和配置。

Pythonic 方法

Python 是一种通用编程语言，已经存在了大约 30 年。早期，它是自动化脚本的首选。然而，随着 Django 和 Flask 等框架的出现，它的受欢迎程度越来越高，现在各种领域中都在应用它，如企业应用程序开发。数据科学和机器学习进一步推动了它的发展，Python 现在是三大编程语言之一。

许多人将 Python 的成功归功于它容易编码。这只是一部分原因。只要你的目标是开发小型脚本，Python 就像一个玩具，你会非常喜欢它。然而，当你进入严肃的大规模应用程序开发领域时，你将不得不处理大量的 if 和 else，Python 变得与任何其他平台一样好或一样坏。例如，采用一种面向对象的方法！许多 Python 开发人员甚至可能没意识到 Python 支持类、继承等功能。Python 确实支持成熟的面向对象开发，但是有它自己的方式 -- Pythonic！让我们探…</span>

ToolJet is an open source, low-code framework for rapidly building and deploying internal tools. Our codebase is 100% JavaScript and TypeScript.
A lone developer in April 2021 started ToolJet. The public beta launched in June 2021 and was an instant hit. With this traction, ToolJet raised funding, and currently, we have a team of 20 members.
Why open source?
Before working on ToolJet, I worked with a few enterprise clients as a consultant. Many of these clients were large enough to build and maintain dozens of internal tools. Despite the constant requests from sales, support, and operations teams to add more features and fix the bugs in their internal tools, engineering teams struggled to find the bandwidth …</span>

                              <span>@vercel/og. It allows us to dynamically generate Open Graph images - and do it super fast. You can even use Tailwind for your templates!

I was super excited about it, so I spent some time and created a bunch of Tailwind templates for the community which you can copy and paste into your codebase, customise them however you want, and start using them for your website!

To keep the templates easy to get started, I only used the default font family and font weight (Noto Sans Regular). However, I also created a tutorial to show you how to use your custom fonts and multiple font weights within your templates.

I plan to work on many more templates in the future, so let me know if you&#x27;d like anything specific and I can have a look.

Check it out and let me know what you think!

🤔 What is Glasp?
Glasp is a social web highlighter that people can use to highlight and organize quotes and thoughts from the web without having to switch back and forth between screens, and access other like-minded people’s learning at the same time.

Our mission is to democratize access to other people’s learning and experiences that they have collected throughout their lives as a utilitarian legacy. As Glasp stands for &quot;Greatest Legacy Accumulated as Shared Proof&quot;, we want to visualize your contribution to human knowledge history.

Besides the Kindle Highlight Export, you can do:

✅ Highlight &amp; annotate on YouTube videos: 🎥
✅ Highlight text on the web: 🔴 🟡 🟢 🔵
✅ Highlight &amp; annotate PDF files hosted on the web ✍️
✅ Discover more useful content from other curators: 🤝

... and many more!

We’re excited for the Product Hunt community to check it out and would love to get any feedback to improve Glasp!


🧭 What&#x27;s Coming Up Next:
- Better personalization of content discovery &amp; like-minded people search
- Improved UX &#x3D; UI updates + bug fix

Let&#x27;s highlight the world&#x27;s information and make it universally accessible and useful together!

Happy learning,
Kazuki

                              <span>作为在大城市工作的年轻人，租房是一个永远都绕不开的“时髦”话题。能够拥有一个舒适的小窝，让自己在忙碌一天之后彻底放松和沉静下来，对我来说应该是每天最触手可及的快乐。但是，租来的房子总有各种不尽如人意的地方，而且受限于房东的要求、时间、财力等问题，也不可能像小红书家居博主的租房视频一样进行大改，所以，我将我的小屋改造计划关键词定为：小改小造。当然，所谓的修补也不可能是一步到位的，经过了小半年的边住边搞，到现在才基本完成了一开始的大部分设想。如果你和我一样也有想要小改小造的想法，那么我希望这篇文章可以对你有一些帮助。
（本文有可能巨长，请耐心地看这篇流水账~）
租来的基本状况
本着不在路上花过多时间，并且要最大化个人生活空间的原则，我选择租公司附近两公里范围内的一室户，这不可避免地限制了我的很多租房想法。除去价格不菲的商用公寓和城中村，几乎就已经没有其他的选项，所以选来选去，只能做出妥协，定了一个小区里的公寓楼。
户型状况
我租到的是一室一厅的户型，但这栋公寓都有一个致命的缺点——客厅不见光。没有办法，租房不可能样样完美，考虑到白天几乎都在工作，周末和假期也尽可能逼迫自己出门浪而不是在家里发霉，所以也就勉强接受了这个缺陷。总的来说，这个户型面积相对可观，除了一些无法改动的分区（例如卫生间和厨房），其余还是有很多空间可以利用。
我家的简单户型图
室内状况
这栋公寓大多数房源，都归属于几个来深圳避寒的东北大姐，难得我这间的房东是一个系那个对年轻的国企深二代。但房东自己并不是一个乐于布置的人，房间里大多数的设施都是为了方便他做铲屎官，所以除了还算认真地定制了柜子、装了电视以及摆了一个还能用的沙发。
总的来说，租来的状况仅仅是个凑活，对我而言还远远不能达到拎包入住的状态。好在我个人也有一些从上一个家带来的“资产”，和一些软装的小计划，因此这个水平也刚好给了我一些发挥的空间。于是，漫漫“…</span>

大家好我是车不能快，一个有点闲的键盘爱好者，很高兴和大家再次见面。这次开启了一个新栏目《键微知著》，这个栏目主要是分享一些我自己对于跟键盘有关的想法和看法，比较主观，所以观看的时候还望大家海涵 ，不过这个栏目的更新频率不会太高，因为确实比较需要时间去沉淀，也算是我玩键盘留下的一些痕迹。
切入正题，今天就来讲讲前段时间异军突起的小众配列——Alice。

FOFO拍摄
想必这把键盘大家都不会陌生，Spring这把键盘在今年可谓是「声名远扬」，凭借优秀的手感表现成功突围，同时也带动了Alice这个小众配列再次火了一把，连量产环境都受到了一定的影响，出现了许多量产的Alice键盘以供玩家选择。
例如：akko Alice、 Keychron Alice、FEKER Alice等

SnVittarius 拍摄 akkoAlice

feker Alice
第一眼看到Alice键盘的感觉是「怪异」，对于变形的抗拒、对于传统的坚守，是的，说来惭愧，作为一个客制化的玩家，很多时候我还是秉持着传统的观念去看待这些新奇的产品，不过我觉得这也是客制化对我最大的意义所在，有机会去尝试这些新鲜事物，思想上也能从传统保守的观念束缚中得以抽身。都什么年代，还在玩传统键盘？
然而在经过将近一年的使用之后，我对于Alice配列的疑惑不减反增。这个配列好在哪？为什么会有这么多的玩家能接受和使用它？
回头看，那些曾经贴在它身上的标签「人体工学键盘」、&quot;裂开的键盘&quot;、「独具美感的键盘」，究竟哪些词汇形容这把键盘最为贴切？
为了寻找答案，我开始了漫长的搜寻之旅，敲击着手上的Alice配列，答案仿佛就在指尖。

当我们介绍Alice配列时，印象最为深刻的点是什么？

主播模式

目前只录入了部分内容，逐步添加中；部分 shownotes 主播信息不是特别清楚
 
节目模式
 
其他

iOS 支持跳转小宇宙（安卓没有测试过）
主播界面支持单期节目图
主播支持添加到桌面，桌面图标会自动选择最新一期的封面图
节目支持添加到桌面，桌面图标会选择界面 logo

未来计划

目前都是个人手工录入，所以数量还比较少（一派目前已经全部录入），未来会开放录入能力，大家一起来迭代

有任何建议，欢迎评论~</span>

作为 macOS 用户，本地音乐管理一直是我感到头疼的问题。虽然大部分时间都在 macOS 系统下，但我目前的音乐资料库，是在 Windows 系统上使用 Musicbee 整理而成，文件夹结构是：歌手/专辑/单曲，并且自定义了各类的播放列表（m3u 格式），这些内容都通过群晖 NAS 在各个设备上同步。
资料库中大部分是从 CD 导入，这样做的好处是可以很容易的抓取正确歌曲名，轨道信息及专辑封面等内容。网上下载的音乐信息会相对混乱，但在导入时我也会手动进行整理，因此资料库 90% 以上的音乐经过整理、拥有专辑封面。
macOS 中不管是曾经的 iTunes 或现在的 Apple Music 都不支持直接导入 Flac 格式文件，需要转换成 ALAC 或者 WAV 格式才能使用，非常繁琐。给我心中埋下了需要寻找全新应用的种子。
而在没有寻找本地音乐软件前，我使用 Audio Station ——群晖官方提供的音乐套件。在 iOS 上也有对应的 app 可以访问资料库在线播放。但 Audio Station 并没有桌面软件，只能通过浏览器访问，不是很方便，同时远程访问音乐难免会遇到网络问题，总没有直接存储在本地来的方便。
Audio Station 网站截图
于是我希望找到一个好用的音乐软件来解决这些问题，总结来说，我对它有这几点畅想：

可以导入指定位置音乐文件，并无需复制至其他位置，或打乱原有文件顺序；
兼容大部分常见的音乐格式；
可以导入 m3u 格式的播放列表，并且正确关联音乐文件；
优美的界面展示，可以显示专辑封面；

FFmpeg 被描述为多媒体的瑞士军刀。它集成了数百个视频、音频和图像解码器和编码器、多路复用器和解复用器、过滤器和设备。FFmpeg 是第一个在其细分市场上完全消除了专有软件的大规模 FOSS 项目之一。几乎所有的多媒体相关公司都依靠 FFmpeg 来完成他们的重任。在多媒体方面，FFmpeg 几乎是所有问题的解决方案。如果它不是，你更有可能去修补 FFmpeg，而不是去开发新的东西。顺便说一句，FFmpeg 的创始人 Fabrice Bellard 也是 QEMU 的创始人。

老王点评：FFmpeg 简直是垄断性的成功。说起这个来，我记得有几家公司被列入了其耻辱榜。




Electron 上运行的 Windows 95 发布新版本

发布于 27 年前的 Windows 95 虽然早已停止支持，但仍被一些人认为是微软创造的最伟大的产品之一。有爱好者使用 Electron 开发了名为“Windows 95”复刻版应用，借助该框架，它可以在 Windows、macOS 和 Linux 上运行。该应用刚刚发布了最新版本 3.1.1，得益于底层框架 Electron 从 v18 升级到 v21，它带来了一些重大变化，比如支持最新的 Chromium 106，支持深色模式。

比特币网络花了一个半小时才产生了一个区块

根据区块浏览器的数据，最近比特币网络开采出的两个区块间隔了 85 分钟，有超过 13,000 笔交易被积压。上周，比特币经历了一次难度调整，以确保区块确认每 10 分钟进行一次。随着采矿难度飙升至 35.6 万亿，开采比特币的成本变得更高。闪电网络的创始人说，在不考虑难度变化的情况下，每隔 34 天会发生一次 85 分钟区块间隔。

                              <span>在本指南中，我们将逐步介绍如何在 Linux 中创建 LVM 分区。


LVM 代表 “逻辑卷管理Logical Volume Management”，它是专门为服务器管理 Linux 系统上的磁盘或存储的推荐方式。 LVM 分区的主要优点之一是我们可以实时扩展其大小而无需停机。 LVM 分区也可以缩小，但不推荐。

为了演示，我在我的 Ubuntu 22.04 系统上连接了 15GB 磁盘，我们将从命令行在该磁盘上创建 LVM 分区。

准备


连接到 Linux 系统的原始磁盘

具有 sudo 权限的本地用户

预装 lvm2 包


事不宜迟，让我们深入了解这些步骤。

步骤 1、识别新连接的原始磁盘

登录到你的系统，打开终端并运行以下 dmesg 命令：

$ sudo dmesg | grep -i sd


在输出中，查找大小为 15GB 的新磁盘。



识别新连接的原始磁盘的另一种方法是通过 fdisk 命令：

$ sudo fdisk -l | grep -i /dev/sd


输出：



从上面的输出，可以确认新连接的磁盘是 /dev/sdb。

步骤 2、创建 PV（物理卷）

在开始在磁盘 /dev/sdb 上创建物理卷Physical Volume（PV）之前，请确保已安装 lvm2 包。如果未安装，请运行以下命令：

$ sudo apt install lvm2     // On Ubuntu / Debian
$ sudo dnf install lvm2    // on RHEL / CentOS


运行以下 pvcreate 命令在磁盘 /dev/sdb 上创建 PV：

$ sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb
  Physical volume &quot;…</span>

                              <span>LURE 是一个新的开源项目，它希望成为所有发行版的 AUR。




AUR（Arch 用户仓库Arch User Repository）是一个由社区驱动的基于 Arch 的 Linux 的发行版仓库。

简而言之： 它可以帮助你安装官方仓库中没有的软件包，并让你获得最新的版本。

我发现它对我在 Manjaro Linux 上的体验很有帮助。

从技术上讲，AUR 从源头构建一个软件包，然后利用软件包管理器（pacman）来安装它。

你也可以在我们的详细指南中探索更多关于它的信息。


什么是 AUR？ 如何在 Arch 和 Manjaro Linux 中使用 AUR？


📢 现在你对 AUR 有了一个基本的了解，有一个 新的开源项目 旨在将 AUR 的功能带到所有的发行版中。

这个项目被称为 “Linux 用户仓库Linux User REpository”（LURE）。


💡 LURE 项目正处于 alpha 阶段，由创建者在几周前宣布。所以，它完全是一个正在进行的工作。


已经有这样的项目了？



没有。

开发者们已经尝试做一个 AUR 的替代品，但是是针对特定的发行版。就像 makedeb 软件包仓库 是针对 Debian 的。

LURE 是一个雄心勃勃的想法，可以在你选择的任何发行版上工作。

它试图成为一个帮助你使用类似于 PKGBUILD 的脚本为你的发行版创建原生软件包的工具。


创建 PKGBUILD 为 Arch Linux 制作软件包


开发者在 Reddit 公告帖子 中提到了一些技术细节：


我的项目叫 LURE，是 “Linux 用户仓库”的简称。它构建原生软件包，然后使用系统软件包管理器安装它们，就像 AUR 一样。它使用一个类似于 AUR 的 PKGBUILD 的构建脚本来构建软件包。

它是用纯 Go 语言编写的，这意味着它在构建后没有任何依赖性，除了一些特权提升命令（sudo，doas 等等）和任何一个支持的软件包管理器，目前支持 pacman、apt、apk（Alpine Linux 上，不是安卓）、dnf、yum 和 zypper。


听起来很棒！


LURE 项目Repo


你也可以在它的 GitHub 镜像 上探索更多信息。

使用 LURE

你不必安装一个额外的软件包管理器来使它工作，它可以自动与你系统的软件包管理器一起工作。

因此，如果它在其仓库（或任何其添加的仓库）中没有找到一个包，它就会转到系统的默认仓库，并从那里安装它。就像我用 lure 命令在我的系统上安装/移除 neofetch 一样。



虽然该项目处于早期开发阶段，但它为各种发行版提供了 二进制包，以让你安装和测试它们。



目前，它的仓库包括一个来自创建者自己的项目。但你可以尝试添加一个仓库并构建/安装东西。

为了方便起见，我试着在它的仓库中安装软件包。



命令看起来像这样：

lure in itd-bin


在它的 官方文档页面，你可以读到更多关于它在构建/安装/添加存储库方面的用法。

未来版本的一些计划中的功能包括：


自动安装脚本

基于 Docker 的自动测试工具

仓库的网页接口


让它变得更好

嗯，首先，这是一个优秀的项目。如果你是过去使用过 Arch 的人，或者想离开 Arch Linux，这将是一个很好的工具。

然而，对于大多数终端用户和非 Arch Linux 新手来说，像 Pamac GUI 软件包管理器 这样的软件包管理器支持 LURE 应该是锦上添花的。

当然，在目前的阶段，它需要开源贡献者的支持。所以，如果你喜欢这个想法，请随时为该项目贡献改进意见

合成党是今年 5 月丹麦成立的一个新的党派，倡导人类与 AI 的和谐共处。该党派正试图在今年 11 月的丹麦议会选举中赢得一个席位。令人吃惊的是，合成党的公众形象和挂名领袖是一个名叫 Leader Lars 的 AI 聊天机器人。它根据 1970 年以来丹麦各个边缘政党的政策编程，旨在代表 20% 不参加选举的丹麦人的价值观。它通过 Discord 与民众交流。但它不会参与投票。

AI 专家点评各大 AI

UNDARK 对纽约大学名誉教授 Gary Marcus 进行了采访，在采访中他对当前的几个主流 AI 进行了有趣的点评：GPT-3 “其实是一个自动完成系统，可以预测下一个单词和句子。就像你的手机一样，你输入一些东西，它就会继续。它并不真正理解它周围的世界。”谷歌的 LaMDA “没有知觉，它不知道自己在说什么东西”。无人驾驶汽车“仅仅记住你所见过的大量交通情况并不能表达你真正需要了解的世界”。OpenAI 的 DALL-E “利用了人类的非故意贡献，他们也许已经签署了‘服务条款’协议，但没有认识到这一切会导致什么”。

修好了电脑的 Linus Torvalds 呼吁内核开发人员别赶 Deadline

Linus Torvalds 发布了 Linux 内核 6.1 的第一个 rc 版本，对这个版本，Torvalds 说，“不算小，但比过去几个版本小”。内核的每一个新版本都有一个为期两周的合并窗口，“企鹅皇帝”说，“在我把我的机器整理好并赶上合并窗口后，我对各种迟到的拉取请求感到有些沮丧。我以前提到过这个，但是在合并窗口的最后几天收到相当多的拉动请求，这真的很烦人。”然后他抱怨内核开发人员们没有尽早提交代码，不要“在两周内匆匆忙忙地把一个分支放在一起，然后在第二周的星期五发给 Linus。……在截止日期前熬夜完成论文的做法在高中毕业后就应该被淘汰了。你知道我说是谁”。

即使你设法安装了 Arch Linux，你也会注意到它严重依赖命令行。如果你需要安装应用或更新系统，那么必须打开终端。

是的！Arch Linux 没有软件中心。我知道，这让很多人感到震惊。

如果你对使用命令行管理应用感到不舒服，你可以安装一个 GUI 工具。这有助于在舒适的图形化界面中搜索包以及安装和删除它们。

想知道你应该使用 pacman 命令 的哪个图形前端？我有一些建议可以帮助你。

请注意，某些软件管理器是特定于桌面环境的。

1、Apper



Apper 是一个精简的 Qt5 应用，它使用 PackageKit 进行包管理，它还支持 AppStream 和自动更新。但是，没有 AUR 支持。

要从官方仓库安装它，请使用以下命令：

sudo pacman -Syu apper

2、深度应用商店



深度应用商店是使用 DTK（QT5）构建的深度桌面环境的应用商店，它使用 PackageKit 进行包管理，支持 AppStream，同时提供系统更新通知。 没有 AUR 支持。

要安装它，请使用以下命令：

sudo pacman -Syu deepin-store

Web 组件是一系列开源技术（例如 JavaScript 和 HTML）的集合，你可以用它们创建一些 Web App 中可重用的自定义元素。你创建的组件是独立于其他代码的，所以这些组件可以方便地在多个项目中重用。

首先，它是一个平台标准，所有主流的浏览器都支持它。

Web 组件中包含什么？


定制元素：JavaScript API 支持定义 HTML 元素的新类别。

影子 DOM：JavaScript API 提供了一种将一个隐藏的、独立的 文档对象模型（DOM）附加到一个元素的方法。它通过保留从页面的其他代码分离出来的样式、标记结构和行为特征对 Web 组件进行了封装。它会确保 Web 组件内样式不会被外部样式覆盖，反之亦然，Web 组件内样式也不会“泄露”到页面的其他部分。

HTML 模板：该元素支持定义可重用的 DOM 元素。可重用 DOM 元素和它的内容不会呈现在 DOM 内，但仍然可以通过 JavaScript 被引用。


开发你的第一个 Web 组件

你可以借助你最喜欢的文本编辑器和 JavaScript 写一个简单的 Web 组件。本指南使用 Bootstrap 生成简单的样式，并创建一个简易的卡片式的 Web 组件，给定了位置信息，该组件就能显示该位置的温度。该组件使用了 Open Weather API，你需要先注册，然后创建 APPID/APIKey，才能正常使用。

调用该组件，需要给出位置的经度和纬度：

                              <span>1年多前，由于工作原因，主力开发机换成了 Windows，还入了 Office 365 全家桶。于是在时隔多年后，再次用起了 OneNote。不得不说，都2022年了，OneNote 的码字体验还停留在十多年前，一堆大大小小的遗留问题。但我实在懒得折腾什么 Notion、 Obsidian（没有复杂的知识管理需求），只想找个本地/靠谱/大厂出品/开箱即用的笔记软件，简单记录下工作相关内容。 毕竟人一旦习惯了 markdown 的符号 # 和 -，就真的回不去了。于是研究了下 OneNote 的 api，决定自己动手，丰衣足食。OneMark 由此诞生。
实时渲染
废话不多说，直接上动图。

简单来说，OneMark 实现了基于行的实时渲染，每次按回车时会触发渲染当前行。当然，这个实时 跟新世代编辑器字符级别的没法比，但已经足够好用了。
不仅如此，终于在 OneNote 上实现了可用级别的代码高亮，输入&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;创建代码块后，每敲一行自动着色。用过 OneNote 的都懂，之前插入代码需要诸多操作，繁琐到想摔键盘。

以及 LaTex 转换到 OneNote 原生的数学公式（不是图片）。

除此之外，还支持TOC / todo / 水平线 / 脚注 等常见的语法，直接拿已有的 markdown 内容粘贴到 OneNote 中， 然后按 F5 渲染，大概率是可以完美还原的。

 
没有美美的样式主题，怎么能算一个合格的笔记软件呢？众所周知，OneNote 本身的样式功能十分鸡肋，用户很难自定义主题，只能默默忍受一成不变的素面朝天。于是我花了好大力气，实现了解析 css 样式的功能，从此 OneNote 的笔记颜值终于能打了。

双向编辑
你可能会问：这种转换是单向的吗？我如果有一天想导出 markdown 纯文本怎么办？在我看来，原始 markdown 丢失是绝对不能接受的，所以我花了很大力气来解决这个问题：笔记中每个段落的 markdown 原文都以某种格式隐藏存储在自身之中，可以随时读取，不依赖外部文件，任意编辑也不会破坏。而且这种格式是公开透明的，只需要用 OneNote api 拿到 XML 格式的笔记内容，所有秘密一览无余。
更重要的是，渲染后的内容可以原地随意增删修改，不必再重新切换回 markdown 形态编辑； 而且在导出 markdown 时，内容也会相应更新——是的，实现了双向更新。当然，如果由于某些原因，你想切换回 markdown 形态编辑，也是支持的。按 ctrl + , ，即可在编辑和预览之间切换。

结语
OneMark 目前只支持 OneNote Windows 桌面版，不支持 UWP 版本以及 Mac 版本（好消息是微软正着手将 UWP 版本的功能迁移到桌面版，以后会只保留桌面版，最近的更新频率也让广大 OneNote 使用者倍感惊喜）。官网 https://onemark.neuxlab.cn/， 欢迎大家试用反馈。
后记：我为什么选择 OneNote
有人会问：不是有很多专业的 markdown 笔记软件吗，为什么还要用 OneNote？
我个人的感悟是：我首先需要的是一个自由轻松的笔记软件，其次是 markdown。我是一个懒人，无论是日常生活，还是工作学习，都没有那么 organized，十分不擅长把东西整理并保持得井井有条。我的笔记中，有一些认真记录和思考产出的内容，但更多时候，是很随意、很碎片、很当下的信息记录。我试过，当面对一个专业的 markdown 笔记软件时，我会变得十分紧张不自在，不知道该把这些零碎、混乱的信息放到哪里。一旦产生了这种情绪，想要记录的念头也随即不了了之。
而 OneNote 简单直接的界面、清晰的笔记结构、自由的无限画布，让我使用起来没有任何心理压力。唯一的缺点就是当需要认真输出内容时，没有 markdown 这件趁手的兵器，确实有点力不从心。补齐了这点之后，对于我个人而言就别无他求了。
其实十多年前，OneNote 刚推出的时候也曾惊艳四座， 那时的设计理念和体验还是很超前的，有了现在流行的 block level 编辑器的雏形，无论是列表、段落、表格，书写和调整起来都非常得心应手。也多亏了这些设计，结合 markdown 之后居然毫不违和，整体体验下来有点现代编辑器的味道了。个中玄妙，就待各位亲自上手把玩了。</span>

切入正题，本篇专栏来讲讲我最近自己入手的一套的键帽——
《繁文生肖》

来自IC
说实话这套键帽一开始并没有引起我的注意，因为热升华的PBT键帽在色彩表现力上是远不如二色成型工艺的键帽。但在我往下翻阅的时候，渲染图直接抓住了我的心。

IC
毫无疑问，这是第一套有繁体中文字根设计的键帽，并且确实是超出常规的设计，可以说手套哥的设计水准确实不是盖的。

打样
但随之而来的就是几个问题在我心头萦绕。

1·工艺问题
本次代工是高端键帽大厂DOMIKEY。对于dmk的实力和做工，我是非常认可的，但问题在于，这是dmk的第一套pbt热升华键帽，此前他们从未有生产过热升华键帽，虽然在我的前一篇科普关于热升华工艺键帽我个人的一些理解 - 哔哩哔哩 (bilibili.com)已经简略介绍了一些有关于PBT热升华的知识，但是这些只是纸上谈兵罢了，高端热升华键帽之所以是高端热升华，是因为随着价格的提升，消费者的要求也随之提升——遮光性、字符清晰度、手感、键帽弯曲等等瑕疵不能出现。如果价格来到了这个价位，那么这些要求我认为也是合情合理的。
2·价格问题
厂虎的价格是499小全套，个性纹样129。这个价格，真心不算低了，即便是目前所谓的顶级热升华键帽CRP,价格也是600目前涨价之后。DOMIKEY第一次做热升华键帽，便开出如此顶级的价格，虽然是比二色要便宜一些，但热升华的成本并不算高，这么看来dmk应该是对于自己工艺非常有信心，并且有着对这套键帽设计极高的预期。事实证明，他的确押对宝了。
这套限时不限量的键帽在三天的开车预售时间内卖出了800+的惊人成绩。同时再一次证明了我的观点，买…</span>

The open source roots of DevOps tools are undeniable, even with a prediction that the global DevOps market will reach $17.8 billion by 2026. The changing world of work, security, and compliance concerns, along with venture capital firms, are pushing the market to DevOps platforms where development teams can access a complete end-to-end DevOps toolchain in the cloud.
The current state of open source DevOps tools
Let&#x27;s get one thing straight: There&#x27;s no way open source tools will disappear from the DevOps world. Right now, there&#x27;s a balance between open source and vendor DevOps tools, with developers using what works for them. Indeed, there are plenty of cases when a development team chooses an ope…</span>

How do you design a programming language to be powerful yet still easy to use? Rexx offers one example. This article describes how Rexx reconciles these two seemingly contradictory goals. 
History of Rexx programming language
Several decades ago, computers were shifting from batch to interactive processing. Developers required a scripting or &quot;glue&quot; language to tie systems together. The tool needed to do everything from supporting application development to issuing operating system commands to functioning as a macro language.
Mike Cowlishaw, IBM Fellow, created a solution in a language he named Rexx. It is widely considered the first general-purpose scripting language.
Rexx was so easy to use and…</span>

                              <span>黑曜石 1.0 做了重新设计，带来了有价值的新功能。




黑曜石Obsidian 是一款强大的笔记应用，可以用来制作知识图谱，同时还提供 Notion 类似的功能。

在 1.0 更新之前，我们已经有一篇关于它的 详细文章。

黑曜石 1.0 的发布标志着该应用在桌面和移动体验方面的发展迈出了关键一步。


💡 黑曜石不是一个开源的应用程序，但可以在 Linux 上使用。


让我们来看看它的桌面版提供的新功能。

🆕 黑曜石 1.0 的新功能



1.0 版本增加了大量的新功能、主要的视觉变化和错误修复，其中一些亮点包括：


改良的用户界面

新的外观设置

带有标签堆叠的标签功能

大修的主题画廊

各种错误的修复


🎨 用户界面的改造



用户界面已经得到了全面改造，这使得用户体验更加直观和强大。



除此之外，黑曜石现在还有一个专门的外观设置部分。它包含了切换显示内联标题、标签标题栏、改变重点颜色等选项的设置。



带有标签堆叠的标签功能



现在你可以在黑曜石中打开多个标签，并使用热键来帮助你在忙碌的一天中完成多个任务。

一个额外的好处是，即使你退出黑曜石，它也会记住你曾经打开的标签和你在这些标签中的活动状态。



标签也可以分组形成堆叠，并在它们之间进行切换，从而使工作空间变得更加整齐。

🛠️ 其他变化

其他值得一提的变化包括：


改变缩放级别的能力

改进了黑曜石的同步

内存泄漏修复

用于折叠行的折叠命令


你可以通过 发布说明，以及 发布公告 来了解更多的细节。

📥 下载黑曜石 1.0

你可以到 官方网站 下载黑曜石 1.0。在手机上，也可以在谷歌应用商店和苹果的应用商店上找到它。

为 Linux 用户提供了三个软件包：AppImage、Flatpak 和 Snap。

开发者还澄清说，他们不会向个人用户收取黑曜石的使用费。

💬 你对黑曜石 1.0 有什么看法？一个值得替代其他记事本的应用程序吗？

                              <span>谷歌宣布推出 Rust 开发的 KataOS 操作系统

谷歌本周宣布发布 KataOS，它是用于进行机器学习的嵌入式设备的操作系统。KataOS 从设计上就具备安全考虑，不但几乎完全是由 Rust 实现的，而且是建立在 seL4 微内核的基础之上，seL4 在数学上被证明是安全的，具有保证保密性、完整性和可用性。


消息来源：谷歌



老王点评：谷歌的操作系统之心不死啊，时不时的就发布一个操作系统，然而，Linux 仍然是谷歌用的做到的操作系统。




谷歌搜索 emoji 相关词汇时会报错

有网友发现，在谷歌上搜索“how many emojis on iOS”、“how many emojis on windows” 等内容时，谷歌搜索引擎会极其罕见的报服务器错误：“处理您的请求时，似乎出现了内部服务器错误”。据分析，这是出现在结果中的一个特定网页可能导致了这个错误，很可能是 Emojipedia.com 网站。谷歌已经修复了该问题。


消息来源：Bleeping Computer



老王点评：这真是太罕见了，我是第一次听说谷歌会因为某个搜索结果而导致服务器内部错误。




Pine64 宣布了一款不到 10 美元的 Linux 单板计算机

这款名为 Ox64 的单板计算机有一个双核 RISC-V 处理器，64MB 的嵌入式内存，支持高达 128Mb 的闪存和一个用于额外存储的 MicroSD 卡。预计它将支持 RTOS 和 Linux，模糊了微控制器和极低功率的单板电脑之间的界限。它预计将在 11 月上市销售，RTOS 版本起价为 6 美元，Linux 兼容型号起价为 8 美元。


消息来源：Pine64



老王点评：这个单板机看起来不错，还挺便宜。</span>

                              <span>每个创业者的目标都是成功退出，而传统的退出路径包括IPO上市，或者被并购。
TechCrunch的一项调查显示，创业公司从成立到成功退出的平均时长接近6年。
各地区从创业到退出年限的平均数、中位数
这无疑增加了创业门槛，意味着一旦选择创业，需要6年时间才能收获结果。这尤其对奉行精益创业理念的小微创业企业（Micro Startup）或者超级个体不友好，导致这些创业者要么继续做大直到退出，要么慢慢变成一个“副业”。
你可能会问，做大有什么不好？有的创业者适合指挥千军万马，而有的创业者更擅长抓住每一个灵感闪现。例如，以色列号称Startup Nation，大批创业者完成产品0-1搭建后就把公司卖给大企业，然后继续投入新的创业中，反而坚持做大到IPO的比较少，这与以色列的市场规模和地理位置有关。
所以，不断降低创业者成功退出的门槛，让专注创新的创业者持续创新，让擅长增长的创业者不断增长，对激活创业生态至关重要。
为小微创业者提供便捷、低门槛的推出服务，已成为海外SaaS创业中一个重要的细分方向。海外正在兴起一批相关的平台，但国内却还没有对应的趋势，值得国内创业者们分析和借鉴。
Flippa：最大的数字资产交易平台
Flippa成立于2009年，现在已经是全球第一大的数字资产交易平台，有超过300万注册用户，可以交易的资产包括网站、app、域名、网店、自媒体账号、甚至是SaaS应用等等——这也正是广大微创业或超级个体们最活跃的领域。
Flippa在售的个人网站
与传统的二手商品相比，数字资产交易最大的挑战一是如何估值，二是如何保障信息的真实性。
Flippa平台为卖家提供了一个估值机器人工具，它的算法参考多个因素，包括卖家所售业务模式、运营时间、绩效表现、增长率、类别等。卖家在上传商品时，也需要提供近12个月的运营数据。
Flippa也提供尽职调查的服务，卖家可以选择授权买家查看他…</span>

I love the GNOME desktop, and I use it as my daily Linux desktop environment. I find with GNOME, I can focus on the stuff I need to get done, but I still have flexibility to make the desktop look and act the way I want.
The GNOME Project recently released GNOME 43, the latest version of the GNOME desktop. I met with GNOME developer Emmanuele Bassi to ask a few questions about this latest release:
Jim Hall (Jim): GNOME has lots of great desktop features. What are some of the new features in GNOME 43?
Emmanuele Bassi (Emmanuele): GNOME 43 has a complete redesign of the system status menu in the Shell. The new design is meant to give quick and easy access to various settings: network connections and VPNs; audio input and …</span>

                              <span>我是如何选择应用的
我的工作流与其他少数派作者相比起来，简直是小巫见大巫了。我并没有独特的电脑技巧，也没有什么私藏的应用。我所得知的应用都基本上是通过少数派的派评系列文章。不过，当我尝试了一些app之后，有好有坏，也花了不少冤枉钱。所以，有时候我都想开一个叫“持续追踪”的栏目以专门反馈后续各个应用的使用情况和想法。
在我苦哈哈地写完小米那篇文章之后，我非常反感那些不稳定且复杂的系统，而且也花了不少冤枉钱，尝到了很多功能繁复且声称能达到很多种效果的应用。我不知道 all-in-one 是什么时候开始的，又是什么时候流行的。
在一些工具群或者相关话题的评论区，提到效率工具，大部分网友都会all in one变成使自己“效率”标签存在的信仰，而对那些没有 all-in-one 的工具嗤之以鼻。这正是令我一直感到奇怪的事情。All-in-one 是否不仅仅只限于工具？如果仅限于工具，这是否未免有些太过工具理性了？我认为，工具的 all-in-one 反倒是弱化了使用者的存在，而为这些工具服役。手机就是一个典型的例子。
另外，从行为学的角度来说，一个东西仅对我产生一个刺激，是最有效的学习方案。在这里，我不想深入探讨行为学背后的各种复杂和千丝万缕的概念，而只是利用两个最基本的概念：一个是桑代克的刺激-反应理论（S-R theory), 即学习是刺激和反应相关联的结果。简单来说，就是培养习惯。
另一个是斯金纳的 Discriminative stimuli，即一种能产生特定反应的刺激，且这种反应更加迅速，不会被轻易替换和消退。这也是我为什么讨厌all in one应用的原因，因为他们的刺激无法令我快速的形成或者产生相对应的刺激。所以，他们大大地降低了我的效率。
所以，为了让自己以后不再花冤枉钱，我为生产力或者效率软件做出了三个规则：

简洁：不简单，美观
易用：用起来不是很复杂，上手简单…</span>

                              <span>从 iPhone X 开始，每年我都会为新的 iPhone 写一篇操作指南，一晃已经到了 iPhone 14 系列。在过去的几年里，智能机的影像理念无论是大方向还是品牌的个性化都在发生着翻天覆地的变化，iPhone 自然也是如此。不过 iPhone 更为难得的是一种在变化和不变中的把控。
是的，不变。
在我看来，「不变」比「变化」更能考验一款产品对于影像技术发展的思考与判断。不过，这个问题我想留在最后再讨论。
使用 iPhone 14 Pro 系列拍摄
相比评测，这篇操作指南我会更多分享我使用 iPhone 14 系列的创作经验。过去的一段时间里，我们使用 iPhone 14 系列拍摄了大量不同主题、不同风格的作品，其间也围绕今年的重要更新——4800 万像素——做了大量探索和尝试。
使用 iPhone 14 Pro Max 拍摄
许多惊喜，当然也有一点问题。我们就先从 4800 万像素带来的第一个改变，50mm 开始。
（注：受平台上传图片大小限制，文章照片均经过压缩。）
延续的系统，新增的焦距
一个重要的逻辑是，当我们谈论手机摄影时，本质上应该把手机作为「相机」在讨论。换言之，无论是相机还是手机，当我们在拍摄时，指导我们的再也不是所谓的参数，而是摄影理念本身。
iPhone 14 Pro 系列 1× 镜头拍摄iPhone 14 Pro 系列 3× 镜头拍摄
对于焦距的认知就是一个最好的例子。
本质上任何的相机都是由机身和镜头两部分组成，其中镜头直接影响着你的取景范围。而取景范围意味着「拍摄题材的选择」。从 iPhone 11 Pro 系列升级为三颗镜头，之后 iPhone 的整个影像理念开始强调「系统性」。整个相机的理念重点是三颗镜头之间的协作。
但如果我们切换为「相机」的认知，目前的 iPhone 就可以理解为一套「定焦镜头组」。在 iPhone 13 Pro 系列上…</span>

多家机构在近期都发布了 AIGC 报告，这个尚在萌芽的赛道获得了巨大的关注，但在更早一些的时候，其中一些更细，更窄的领域，就已经发生了惊天动地的变化，我们将专注其中一个赛道，即 AIGC 中的「生成式文生图」领域，从技术发展，用户调研，商业模式和争议，以及对未来的一些展望，为大家呈现这份报告。
报告的数据及来源包括公开新闻媒体文章，第三方统计数据，6pen 自身数据，以及我们收回的 2398 份问卷调查和对部分行业资深人士的深度访谈。我们的问卷通过 6pen 自有渠道，即刻，微博，以及行业 KOL 分发，最终有效收到 2398 个提交，它们可能是这个行业首次的大批量对用户的直接调查，并聚焦在国内市场，我们认为其具有相当的参考性。
利益相关：本报告由 6pen 调查发布，作为行业从业者，本报告将更多从技术，用户及行业整体视角出发。
 
AI绘画技术发展的简要脉络
GAN时代
在 diffusion 被广泛运用于AI绘画之前，这种艺术形式的主要实现方式 GAN （Generative Adversarial Nets ），以NVlabs的SPADE为例：用户提供草图，由GAN模型将其转化为真实的风景图像。这听起来有点像AI绘画里的img2img，但在这类模型里，用户无法通过文本影响生成结果。

直到类似 CLIP 这种跨模态的图文模型出现，才让用户有办法用文字实现AI作画。后来者如VQGAN+CLIP 或StyleCLIP，均是因为CLIP打通文本和图形域(domain)，用户输入的文本与GAN生成的结果真正有了「可比较性」，这使得计算二者误差并迭代效果成为了可能。

GAN在模拟分布方面有着天然的优势，因此它在人脸属性编辑、风格模仿等领域大放异彩，例如给人戴上墨镜、加上胡子、生成动漫脸、模仿小说风格。也正因如此，它也很容易陷入模型坍缩(Model Collapse)，即…</span>

                              <span>我们大部分人总会身处在一种「身不由己」的状态里，然后内心有一些向往的生活状态，但是现实很残酷，导致自己现在无法去达到目标，于是陷入到了焦虑和无奈的情绪中。
在国庆的节假日里，我见了一个很久未见的朋友。他的孩子已经两岁了，在聊天时，我能感觉到他因为有了孩子后，产生了很大的压力和焦虑。他说，因为有了孩子以后，以往的时间都不由自己来做主了，然后未来所有的计划都变了，已经买好的不错的房子，会因为学区房做改变的计划，然后自己也舍不得消费，想把挣到的钱给孩子准备上。他是一个很负责的人，也希望能多陪孩子，努力工作把孩子养大。但是他觉得自己牺牲了自己看电影、健身，以及和爱人出门旅游的机会，如果要恢复这些，要等孩子长到18岁的成年以后，也就是说，还要等16年。说到这里，他的眼神里露出了一丝无奈。
听到这里，我总觉得哪里不太对，于是产生了一些疑问，面临这样的不由己状态，我们只能无奈或者焦虑？我希望通过这篇文章，呈现出我对这个问题的完整思考，希望你看完后，能够从新的视角去看待自己的问题。
我们不妨先问一个问题：我们为什么讨厌「不由己」的感觉？
答案是：每个人的内心都在追寻某种「自由」。人为什么要追寻自由？其实不仅是人，只要是生物，就会追求自由，追求一种随性地、自然地、丰富地生长。任何人都不希望自己的眼睛永远只盯着一个地方，耳朵只能听见一成不变的音色和音调；不希望身体被禁锢在一个狭小幽闭的空间里不能动弹，不希望思想停止运行，因为当思考停止，就意味着自己不再存在。
自由是人的天性，也可以说，自由是我们不得不接受的权利。
说了那么多自由的不可或缺，那什么才算自由？
一、什么才算自由？
提到自由，我最先想到的是时间和地点的自由。比如做一个旅行 up 主，可以随时出去旅游，想去哪儿就去哪儿，这叫自由。而每天在格子间上班，按照准确的时间上下班打卡，一天里重要的时间都交付给公司和老板，这叫不自由。
这个定义准…</span>

一、问题描述
前段时间碰到一个问题，我 iPhone 背板碎了，需要走 AppleCare 交给苹果返厂维修，而我的 iPhone 是 512GB 的，在备份数据时候麻烦了，我笔记本本身就是 512GB 空间的，肯定不够用呀。
而备份 iPhone 默认的存储位置是在本机的硬盘上，我有个 14T 的硬盘，那么如何将默认的备份位置改到外部存储设备上呢。

二、如何设置备份位置到外部存储器
默认的备份位置在下面这个目录
~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup
其目录是这样的，Backup 里面就是你的每个设备每次的备份记录

我们要做的就是将这个位置映射到你的移动硬盘上去。
1. 确定你的移动硬盘位置
你需要知道自己硬盘的完整文件路径：

打开终端，
输入 cd 然后将你的硬盘图标拖到终端中，就会看到它的路径了
回车进入到移动硬盘目录下，指令 ls -al 能看到硬盘中的所有文件（图片中的 ll 是我自定义的一个指令）
我的就是 /Volumes/Kyle 14TB/ （在终端的路径需要转义空格，所以能看到终端中名字空格前面有个 \）

2. 移动硬盘中新建一个备份文件夹
在你的移动硬盘中新建一个备份文件夹，用于存储接下来的手机备份文件。
mkdir Backup
此时能看到目录中多出一个名为 Backup 的文件夹
 

进入这个文件夹并展示它的绝对路径
cd Backup
pwd
能看到我的这个文件夹的绝对路径是 /Volumes/Kyle 14TB/Backup，这个会在下…</span>

Alan Smithee

Source code must be compiled in order to run, and in open source software everyone has access to source code. Whether you&#x27;ve written code yourself and you want to compile and run it, or whether you&#x27;ve downloaded somebody&#x27;s project to try it out, it&#x27;s useful to know how to process source code through a compiler, and also what exactly a compiler does with all that code.
Build a better mousetrap
We don&#x27;t usually think of a mousetrap as a computer, but believe it or not, it does share some similarities with the CPU running the device you&#x27;re reading this article on.

Stephan Avenwedde

Asynchronous programming: Incredibly useful but difficult to learn. You can&#x27;t avoid async programming to create a fast and reactive application. Applications with a high amount of file or network I/O or with a GUI that should always be reactive benefit tremendously from async programming. Tasks can be executed in the background while the user still makes inputs. Async programming is possible in many languages, each with different styles and syntax. Rust is no exception. In Rust, this feature is called async-await.
While async-await has been an integral part of Rust since version 1.39.0, most applications depend on community crates. In Rust, except for a larger binary, async-await comes with zero costs.…</span>

「如何在不确定的风浪里，实现确定性的成长？」这应该是现今大多人所关注的问题吧。
关于成长，市面上有很多方法论，但它往往都不讲背后的原理。不知道大家是否也和我一样，看到一些方法或者教程，经常会收藏起来，跟练一段时间，但大多都是半途而废，坚持一阵子后又打回原形了。
为什么会这样呢？因为每个人的情况不同，适用的方法也不同。如果只是知其然不知其所以然，那只有不断地尝试各种方法，不断地去磨合，才能找到适合自身的。这个尝试的过程，其实就是通过外界的方法，来获得自身的反馈，从而更了解自己。
但如果我们换个角度，一开始就从了解自己出发，再剖析方法背后的原理，那是不是更容易找到适合自己的方法呢？所以我认为，知其然又知其所以然，反倒是一条捷径。
要了解自己，就得先知道我们的心智是怎么运作的。所谓「心智」，就像是大脑里一个可以不断升级的系统，包含了我们对外部世界的所有认知，也包括因此所造就的思维方式。我们的认知和感觉，其实也只是心智对外部世界的投射而已。
前不久出版的一本新书——《打开心智》，正是围绕「心智」这个概念展开的。兵书有云，「知己知彼，百战不殆」。书中先是阐述了大脑的四个基本原理，帮助我们了解心智是怎么运作的，此为「知己」；然后又围绕情绪、习惯、动力、学习、思考和创造等方面，剖析背后的原理，此为「知彼」。不仅如此，它还提供一套行之有效的方法，让我们能更好地实现自己的目标。所以，这是一本帮助我们认识自我、突破自我的书籍，知己知彼，我们才能更有效实现自我成长，去应对时代的不确定性。

When you manage your IT infrastructure using Foreman and Katello, the smallest unit to operate on is generally a host. You can provision hosts, deliver versioned content, and set configurations. Using Foreman ACD, you can use your Foreman instance to deploy applications consisting of multiple services spanning multiple hosts. This blog post briefly introduces the Foreman ACD plugin and explains how it can help you deploy a Prometheus and Grafana stack. If you want to know more about deploying an ELK stack consisting of an Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana, look at Deploying an ELK Cluster with Application Centric Deployment.

本教程源于 @yetone 的一篇 推文 ，和 @Jack Huang 讨论后稍作修改。
苹果自带的翻译功能在几次版本更新之后已很好用，但需要多个步骤，对专业词汇的支持也没有欧陆词典好（欧陆词典可自行扩充词库）。本教程基于 iOS 自带的 Back Tap 功能，快速启动翻译软件，并支持截图 OCR 翻译。
前期准备
下载软件： 欧路词典 (Eudic) 和快捷指令 (Shortcuts)
「欧路词典」，是一款经典的翻译软件，可自行扩充词库，专业版需付费。
「快捷指令」是苹果官方的软件，前身是 Workflow Gallery，可以理解成一个无代码开发平台（No-Code Development Platform），不需要编程知识，就能完成很多自动化功能的实现。如果对这方面感兴趣，可访问 Shortcuts Gallery 。
安装 Shortcuts
在 Safari 中打开以下两个链接，点击「获取捷径」，再点击「添加快捷方式」。
Clipboard Translate: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b643ecb89dbd4468b8679cd4888b13d9
Image Translate: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/02bf2bb484a54f50897b8a3f315d48fd
【更新】评论区 Nicked 提供的 Shortcuts，单词自动走欧路词典，长文走谷歌翻译，很棒：
https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/40a0993127dc46edb0d5736f8ed10470
 
设置快捷方式
点击「设置」- 辅助功能 – 触控 – 轻点背面（Back Tap）- 设置如图所示：

使用
Clipboard Translate：轻点手机背面两次，自动读取「剪切板」中的文本，并跳转欧路词典翻译。
Image Translate: 轻点手机背面三次，自动截屏，并识别图片中的文本，跳转欧路词典翻译。
扩展：

上文是通过 Back Tap 实现的，日常使用中偶尔会有误触的可能，也可以通过「辅助触控」，俗称「小白点」实现。
macOS 上的全文翻译可参考这篇文章：一种几乎永不失效的网页中英对照翻译方案</span>

                              <span>当我第一次接触「断舍离」这个概念的时候，不仅对它描绘的图景所震撼，而且深切认为这就是我想要的生活。于是我在家里翻箱倒柜的搜索可以丢弃物品，从没用的数据线到大件的废纸箱，只要是能扔的我都直接从家中扔了出去。
也许是一次性丢弃的东西过多，还没等到我开始审视剩下的东西要不要留下，家中有些东西就已经告急了，无奈又开始了买买买的旅程。当我检查购物订单，发现其中含有已经丢弃的物品，我才意识到出现了问题。例如有一次，我需要同时充电多个设备，需要多根数据线，但为了实现「断舍离」，只保留了一根。那时我发现，很多我所丢弃的东西不是不需要的，而是在扔东西那一刻我认为不需要。
仔细想想，这种丢完东西后，又重新买的行为不正是商家所乐意看到的吗？把这种观念作为生活的准则似乎是从另一个方面掉入了消费主义的陷阱。为此我重新审视、省察了「断舍离」这个概念和我所想象的生活，并重新制定了一套可行、节俭的规则。
谨慎购买物品
谨慎购买物品应该是我认为最能体现「断舍离」后生活的方法了。毕竟，我希望看到的是一个没有过多杂物和没用物品的家。既然我无法将所有东西都丢弃，那么就控制新增物品的数量。先对已有物品尽可能收纳，让空间看起来不那么杂乱，再对每个想买的东西进行衡量，如果不是必须的，那就对它说不。
当然，谨慎购买物品也要购买物品。例如：平时生活需要用的牙膏、毛巾等必需品直接买就可以了，买时尽可能货比三家，选择合适的价格和种类。真正应该谨慎购买的是那些看起来有大用，但实际到手可能不会使用的东西。
这里可以分享几个我自己的衡量方法作为参考：
谨慎购买「美好生活」
例如，当我在网上看到了一个洗碗机的广告，它不断的宣传购买洗碗机后解放双手的美好。如果按照宣传所描述的，我是可以购买后有更多的时间去干其他的事情。然而，我回顾日常生活后发现我平时并没有洗大量碗的需求，也就是说，在没看到这个广告前我是不会想象到它所描绘的「美好生活」，…</span>

                              <span>平时工作中往往会遇到新的知识点，这个时候需要我们快速学习并且进行最佳实践。往往是在真正学习了一段时间之后，才会发现有哪些地方可以优化，这样磨合出来的工作流才是最适合自己的。经过两年工作之余的学习后，我磨合出了以下学习工作流：

底层核心逻辑
一开始我学习新知识时会参考一些博客或者是视频，当我开始敲代码实践时往往会出现一些纰漏和错误，我开始意识到我参考的信息可能是错误的，毕竟发博客的门槛低，因此文章的可信度可能不高，于是我开始查阅一些相关的中文书籍。
中文书籍的确是比较全面且系统地讲解了知识点，但众所周知，技术更迭很迅速，又因为老美在 CS 方面一直都是灯塔，所以一般中文书籍里的内容会滞后于当前最新的知识，导致我跟着中文书籍实践会出现软件版本差异的问题。这时我开始意识到一手信息的重要性，有些中文书籍是翻译英文书籍的，一般翻译一本书也要一两年，这会导致信息传递的延迟，还有就是翻译的过程中信息会有损失。如果一本中文书籍不是翻译的呢，那么它肯定也是参考其他书籍的，参考的过程会带有对英文原著中语言和语义理解的偏差。
于是我就顺其自然地开始翻阅英文书籍。不得不说，整体英文书籍内容的质量是比中文书籍高的，一个原因是写英文书籍的作者更会写作，他们会用自己的话很详尽地解释一个知识点，而不是像一些中文书籍那样罗列知识点并且理所当然地以为读者能读懂而忽略一些细节的描述，还有一个原因就是知识很注重时效性，英文书籍的内容往往更新一点。后来随着学习的层层深入，以知识的时效性和完整性出发，我发现 源代码 &gt; 官方文档 &gt; 英文书籍 &gt; 英文博客，最后我得出了一张 信息损失图

虽然一手信息很重要，但后面的 N 手信息并非一无是处，往往这 N 手资料里写了作者对源知识的转化——作者对知识基于某种逻辑的梳理（流程图、思维导图等）以及自己的一些理解（对源知识的抽象、类比、延伸到其他知识点），这些转化可以帮助我…</span>

                              <span>如果说苹果发布会是每年一度的春晚，微信的间歇性更新就像不期而至的假期。在过去的十一年间，微信逐步从最初的简单样子一步步变迁为现在承载了许多功能和期待的国民软件。
而我作为一个非极客普通用户，在翻看朋友圈时蓦然发现这款软件自己也已经不知不觉得用了九年，发布了无数朋友圈内容和加入了许许多多的群聊。自己也从一个微信聊天使用者变成了公众号重度用户和创作者。不妨总结下过去这些年我是如何一步步从抗拒到全面使用微信的以及它带给了我日常生活哪些改变。
面朝屏幕的对话
毫无疑问，所有微信用户使用频率最高的一定是微信的基本功能：聊天。一对一或一对多，文字或语音。每个人都习惯了面对着屏幕表达自己。
加个微信
随着微信的普及，几乎没有朋友没有微信，以至于“加个微信”变成一个礼貌性和建立连接的标准动作。
我一开始并不理解为何微信会拿下偌大的市场，但过年回到老家后看到那么多中老年非QQ用户拿着微信发语音消息时，我才意识到它极大得拓宽了用户群体：“按住说话，松开发送” 简洁而易用。即便是我自己并不喜欢对面突如其来的数个60秒语音（希望微信语音能像子弹短信那样实现可以自动转为文字或者暂停播放的语音管理），但毕竟使用门槛大大降低了，而且简洁爽气的操作界面远远超过了当时花里胡哨的QQ。
所以几乎国内智能手机用户人均一个微信号时，加个微信，犹如一个登门入户的邀请，使得物理分离开之后，依旧保持了进一步交流的可能性，既有的情感更容易维系或加深。
当我们都拥有了一个便宜而高清的通讯渠道时，高昂的运营商资费带来的束缚瞬间被打破，许多亲人和朋友的联系变得频繁。当某个中秋和朋友们打着微信视频“云喝酒”，一起庆祝花好月圆夜时突然觉得科技的进步真好。如果哪一天能够启用Callkit（即像接听电话一样接听），微信电话或视频的体验应该会更好。
遇见陌生人
刚刚开始使用微信时的的朋友大多是熟人，群聊大多是家庭群，工作群，同学群。之后…</span>

                              <span>前段时间清理电脑，发现「坚果云」在电脑上缓存了 50GB 平时用不上的文件。在与技术人员沟通后，被告知自从 M1 芯片发布以来，「云桥模式」的接口就无法使用，缓存只能手动清理。于是萌生了自己搭建一个 NAS 服务器的想法。
什么是NAS

NAS (Network Attached Storage：网络附属存储) 是一种连接您家中或办公室网路的智慧储存装置。您可以将家人或同事的重要文件、珍贵的相片、影音收藏等档案储存于 NAS，仅需透过网页浏览器或手机应用程式，即可轻松存取档案并享有 NAS 提供的丰富服务。

NAS 也可以简单理解为：「不限速的个性化本地网盘」。
不知道你在日常生活中是否遇到过以下的情形：

电脑的储存空间不够用，想要使用文件，但不想把所有文件存在本地；
存在百度云盘的文件或视频，下载速度仅有 69KB/s；
急需从 OneDrive 下载一个文件，却发现 OneDrive 无法打开；
迅雷下载影片，进度超过 98% 之后下载速度只有 5KB/s；
无处安放的照片存在云相册，画质受到不可逆损伤；
MAC 内建备份功能「时间机器」无处备份个人数据；
无法忍受互联网大厂的隐私乱象；
团队协作交互讨论、修改、审批效率太低，大文件传输困难；

如果你在生活中遇到过以上痛点，这篇文章或许会给你提供一个解决思路。
如何选购 NAS
目前的 NAS 市场基本被群晖和威联通垄断，即便是采用 DIY 方案，也还是要使用黑群晖或黑威联通的系统（即破解版系统）。本文以本土化更好些的群晖NAS（Synology NAS）为例，介绍如何选购家用 NAS。

「双核和四核」表示可以同时运行的程序数量。

我是特斯拉 Model 3 的用户，个人觉得特斯拉在大陆的导航和娱乐系统确实不太好用，当然可能也和我日常喜欢用高德导航、Spotify 听歌这些比较多有关系。相信很多特斯拉的用户也和我一样，非常希望能用上苹果的 CarPlay，但特斯拉的车机系统其实是 Linux 并且非常封闭，目前也不太存在破解和安装软件这种捷径的可能。
特斯拉 CarPlay
不过波兰的开发者 Michał Gapiński 前段时间给出了一个用树莓派的解决方法，实现了在特斯拉上使用 CarPlay。因为之前一直需要的两块树莓派的开发板，直到最近简化到了一个并且也简单稳定了不少，我也就做个教程和大家分享下。
准备工作
需要说一下，树莓派 4B 目前的价格依然比较高，整个过程也稍微有点麻烦，折腾的乐趣大于实际使用的意义，不太建议特意为这个去买树莓派，也不太建议不熟悉刷机的朋友尝试。
为了实现在特斯拉上使用 CarPlay 的效果，你需要准备：

树莓派 4B 开发板（需包含 SD 卡和读卡器）
HDMI 转 CSI-2 转接板
Micro HDMI to HDMI 连接线
车连易的 CarPlay 盒子
USB Type-C 数据线（用于刷机以及连接车供电）
一台电脑（用于给树莓派安装系统 Win Mac 都可以）
下载好系统 （版本：2022.38.1)

当然有些是可选的：比如树莓派的外壳和散热风扇，推荐选择塑料的外壳，因为金属的可能会屏蔽树莓派的 Wi-Fi 信号；如果想让特斯拉连接到树莓派的 Wi-Fi 的时候还能使用网络，则需要再购买一个 USB 4G…</span>
