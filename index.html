LG has announced its first bendable OLED TV which works either completely flat or as a curved display. The LG OLED Flex (model LX3) is a 42-inch OLED TV that bends into a curved (900R) TV thanks to LG’s latest display technology. Curved displays are suited for a more immersive gaming experience, while flat screens are better for watching TV broadcasts or streaming services.
LG OLED Flex owners can automatically bend and adjust the TV into its curved mode using a dedicated button on the TV remote. (As opposed to some morphing monitors which have to be manually adjusted). There are two presets or owners can adjust the curve of the display in five percent increments through 20 different levels.

Clear your plans on Saturday: NASA says we’re going to have a rocket launch. 
The space agency moved the date for the next Artemis I rocket launch attempt to Saturday, September 3rd, after determining that the initial plan for Friday was going to run into bad weather. 
There was a 60 percent chance that the launch would have been delayed for weather on Friday, officials said during a media briefing. The two-hour launch window opens at 2:17PM. 
This will be NASA’s second attempt this week at launching its massive next-generation rockets. The first attempted launch on Monday was scrubbed after one of the four RS-25 engines failed to reach the appropriate temperature to allow for liftoff. 
This will be NASA’s second attempt this week at...

                              <span>Introduction


Software development is a profession that requires great flexibility in the ever-changing world of technology and programming languages. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re just at the beginning of your career or if you&#x27;re already an experienced dev, you&#x27;ll have to adapt and learn new things.
Here&#x27;s a list of 3 effective methods of learning new technologies that you can use.

Video tutorials are a great way of learning new things. You can easily find free ones on popular video-streaming websites that will be enough for most cases. If you&#x27;re unsure what exactly you should learn on your path of, let&#x27;s say, front-end mastery, you can search for Bootcamp-type video tutorials curated by professionals. That will help you develop new skills along some predefined path.

                              <span>So, What is 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐚 ?


Solana is a highly functional 𝘰𝘱𝘦𝘯-𝘴𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘤𝘦  project that implements a new, permission less and high-speed layer-1 blockchain. 👾
Created in 2017 by 𝘈𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘰𝘭𝘺 𝘠𝘢𝘬𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘯𝘬𝘰, Solana aims to scale throughput beyond what is typically achieved by popular blockchains while keeping costs low. Solana implements an innovative hybrid consensus model that combines a unique 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐟-𝐨𝐟-𝐡𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 (𝐏𝐨𝐇)  algorithm with the lightning-fast synchronization engine, which is a version of 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐟-𝐨𝐟-𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞 (𝐏𝐨𝐒) . Because of this, the Solana network can theoretically process over 𝟕𝟏𝟎,𝟎𝟎𝟎  transactions per second (TPS)   without any scaling solutions needed.
𝐏𝐒 :𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐚 𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 𝟐𝟒𝟎𝟎𝟎 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐩𝐞𝐫 𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐝 𝐨𝐧𝐥𝐲! 😮
Solana’s 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘳𝘥-𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯  blockchain architecture is designed to facilitate smart contracts and decentralized application (DApp) creation. The project supports an array of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms as well as nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces.
Now question is 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐬 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐚 𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐪𝐮𝐞?
Solana’s ambitious design aims to solve the 𝘣𝘭𝘰𝘤𝘬𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘳𝘪𝘭𝘦𝘮𝘮𝘢 , a concept proposed by Ethereum creator 𝘝𝘪𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘬 𝘉𝘶𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘯, in its unique way. This trilemma describes a set of three major challenges that developers face when building blockchains: decentralization, security and scalability.
It is widely believed that blockchains are built in such a way that forces developers to sacrifice one of the aspects in favor of the other two, as they can only provide two of the three benefits at any given time.
The Solana blockchain platform has proposed a hybrid consensus mechanism that compromises on decentralization to maximize speed. The innovative combination of proof of stake(PoS) and proof of history (PoH) makes Solana a unique project in the blockchain industry.</span>

                              <span>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It’s designed around Git, a system for tracking changes in software code. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. In this article, we’ll take a look at the key concepts of the GitHub development workflow for those in tech including working with repositories, branches, forks, commits, pull requests, and merging. Let’s get started!
Version control is a system that helps developers track and manage changes to a software projects&#x27; code. As projects grow, the need for version control becomes vital — especially in a collaborative project. We can work safely by using what&#x27;s known as branching and merging.

                              <span>Anonymous functions are arrow functions (the functions that do not have a name and are not associated with an identifier). They produce no output and can be used without the function keyword. Arrow functions may not be used as constructors. The context of the arrow functions can be specified lexically or statically. In other languages, they are known as Lambda.
The use of the arrow function syntax reduces the size of the code. Using the arrow function allows us to write less code.
In JavaScript, there are several ways to write a function. You could either define and name a function or define a variable and assign it to an anonymous function.
Example:
function multiply(a, b) {
   return a * b;
}

Can be written as:
const multiply &#x3D; function(a, b){
   return a * b;
}

                              <span>又一个 Markdown 编辑器？我们见的 Markdown 编辑器还少吗？

我明白你的感受，如果你是个 Markdown 爱好者，你可能已经用过很多 Markdown 编辑器了，比如 Joplin 和 Zettlr。但如果你不是的话，你可能根本就不在乎。

Markdown 是一个非常好的标记语言，特别是对那些在网络上写作的人来说。我不想在这里讲太多细节，但如果你有兴趣的话，我们有一篇 非常棒的 Markdown 初学者教程。

这次我想推荐给你（另一个）Markdown 编辑器，它叫 Marktext，并且它是用 Electron 制作的（我们都明白这什么意思，先别急着埋怨我）。

我发现这将是一个很完美的编辑器。它很漂亮，而它运行起来也一样棒。下面是我这几天来的使用体验。

Marktext: 人人可用的 Markdown 编辑器

尽管我很讨厌 Electron 框架，但不得不承认基于 Electron 的应用都有一个干净、现代的界面。



我更喜欢深色模式主题，除此之外官方还提供了五种其它主题。



打开软件你就可以立刻进行写作，如果你不记得某个语法了，那也没有问题，输入 @ 就可以得到语法提示，如：


标题

分隔线

表格

Latex 数学公式

HTML 块

代码块

引用

列表

检查清单

用 Vega-lite.js、Flowchart.js、js-sequence-diagrams 和 PlantUML 制作的图表




选中文本你会得到一个格式选项框，来改变文本为粗体、斜体、下划线、删除线等。你也可以用黄色背景高亮文本、转换为内联代码、内联公式或插入超链接。



Marktext 也支持图片。我们都知道图片不是 Markdown 文件的一部分，它们是外部元素，但是你可以选择将图片…</span>

                              <span>GNOME 43 即将到来。下面是你可以期待在该版本中出现的功能。




GNOME 43 将于 2022 年 9 月 21 日发布。截至目前，GNOME 43 的测试版已经可供测试。

我们在 GNOME 43 测试版中发现的功能和变化应该随着最终版本的发布而到来。

那么，哪些是你最值得期待的 GNOME 43 功能呢？

让我们来看看一些关键的变化。

这个列表集中在视觉/交互式变化上。关于技术变化的完整列表，你可以参考文章底部链接的更新日志。

1、改造了快速设置



GNOME 桌面菜单位于右上角，你可以在这里快速调整音量、访问网络连接，以及开/关电脑，在这个版本中它终于得到了视觉上的更新。

现在，它看起来更像是安卓的快速切换栏，这应该会增强用户体验，同时减少一些多余的点击。



你不需要前往设置来打开深色模式和夜光。新的快速切换菜单就可以让你可以访问到它们。

此外，像选择 Wi-Fi 网络和改变音频设备这样的事情比以前更容易做到。

2、对 Nautilus 文件管理器的改变

虽然我们已经在之前的报道中提到了 GNOME 43 中对 Nautilus 最重要的改变。


GNOME 43 中 Nautilus 文件管理器的 6 个新变化


有几件事值得再次重申。其中一些包括：


使用 GTK 4 的全新外观。

拖动和选择文件的能力（橡皮筋选择）。

紧凑窗口的自适应视图。

新的文件上下文菜单。




总的来说，在 GNOME 43 中，你会发现 Nautilus 文件管理器有了一些视觉上的调整，并有动画的细微改进。

你可以点击每一个选项，访问目录的属性等等来探索其中的差异。它应该感觉更直观一些。

3、设备安全信息



我们之前报道过 GNOME 会在你禁用安全启动时显示警告。


安全启动已被禁用？ GNOME将很快向您发出警告！


你会在你的闪屏和锁屏中看到这个警告。

GNOME 的设置菜单也有一个新的 “设备安全” 选项，在这里你可以看到安全启动状态和其他重要信息，比如：


TPM

英特尔 BootGuard

IOMMU 保护


4、GNOME Web 的扩展支持



GNOME Web 在每次更新都会变得更好一些。有了 Web 扩展的支持，它成为了一个有吸引力的选择，可以取代你的日常使用的浏览器。


有了扩展，GNOME Web 正慢慢成为桌面 Linux 上一个有吸引力的选择


在写这篇文章的时候，该支持仍然是 实验性的，你必须得手动安装扩展。

对于初学者来说，你可以在 Mozilla Firefox 附加组件门户上下载 .xpi 扩展文件。

5、GNOME 软件中心的改进

GNOME 的软件中心目前的体验并不是很好。

虽然它在提供额外信息方面有所改进，但仍有改进的余地。



在 GNOME 43 中，你可以了解到更多关于 Flatpak 应用程序所需的权限。而且，你还可以看到一个 “其他应用程序” 部分，以寻找同一开发者的其它应用程序。

此外，软件包来源的显示方式也有了细微的视觉调整。



附加：新的墙纸

你会得到新的默认壁纸，有深色和浅色的变体。下面是深色壁纸背景的样子：



而这是浅色版本：



除了主要的亮点之外，其他一些变化包括：


Adwaita 图标主题更新。

GNOME 应用程序的性能改进。

各种代码的清理。

对日历的改进。

改良了“关于”窗口。


关于完整的技术细节，你可以参考 GNOME 43 测试版更新日志。

总的来说，GNOME 43 在很大程度上注重提高可用性和用户体验。

最初还计划了一些有趣的功能，但它们没有进入 GNOME 43。也许，GNOME 44 会包括这些？


这里是开发者为 GNOME 43 规划的内容


你对 GNOME 43 的功能有何看法？请在下面的评论中告诉我们你的想法。

                              <span>Ness Labs. Two years ago, I discovered Roam, and today couldn’t imagine managing my studies and my work without it.

Since then, there’s been a renaissance of Tools for Thought – apps to improve your productivity, your creativity and your thinking – but it’s become hard to decide which tool to use, and how to safely transfer your notes if you decide to switch between two tools.

That’s why I created Switchboard, the most comprehensive collection of tutorials for you to safely make the switch from a Tool for Thought to another! 🥳

Inside each Switchboard tutorial, you’ll find:

• Why you may want to switch to the new tool
• The reasons why you may be better off sticking to your current tool (shiny toy syndrome!)
• If you do decide to make the switch, how to safely export your notes from one tool to another
• Tips to quickly get used to your new Tool for Thought

Thanks to @anthilemoon for the support over the past few months while I was working on this project. We’ll keep on adding more tutorials, so let me know if there’s one you want us to create!

In this series, I&#x27;m developing several scripts to help in cleaning up my music collection. In the last article I wrote and tested a Groovy script to clean up the motley assembly of tag fields. In this article, I&#x27;ll separate the framework I&#x27;ve been using into a separate class and then write a test program to exercise it.
Install Java and Groovy
Groovy is based on Java and requires a Java installation. Both a recent and decent version of Java and Groovy might be in your Linux distribution&#x27;s repositories. Groovy can also be installed following the instructions on the Groovy homepage. A nice alternative for Linux users is SDKMan, which can be used to get multi…</span>

To be an effective leader in an open source community, you need a lot of information. How do I know who the most active members in my community are? Which companies are making the most contributions? Which contributors are drifting away and becoming inactive? Who in the community is knowledgeable about a specific topic?
These were just a few of the questions I had when I started leading the Mautic community at Acquia. But the problem was not a shortage of information. On the contrary, there were so many places our community interacted and so many things to track that I was drowning in data. I could access plenty of data sources, but they were not …</span>

作者免责和警示信息：我国目前现行的法律法规对代餐类产品并无严格的规范和限制，在选择代餐产品时请务必慎重。本文作者与文中出现的任何品牌（或其竞争对手）均无利益关联，亦不为文中出现的任何品牌做推荐或背书。有关长期使用代餐的风险和副作用的研究证据仍然不充分，有代谢相关疾病或慢性肝、肾疾病的人士在使用代餐产品前务必征得医生许可。孕妇、哺乳期妇女、婴幼儿、儿童、老人等人群如无特殊需要，最好不食用代餐食品。

根据中国营养学会发布的《代餐食品》团体标准，代餐食品被定义为「为了满足成年人控制体重期间一餐或两餐的营养需要，专门加工配制而成的控制能量食品」。有一些代餐食品能够完全替代一餐的全部正常食物，另一些则只能替代部分正常食物。后者一般称为「部分代餐食品」。
为了便于理解、简化讨论，下文中对完全代餐和部分代餐食品将不做专门区分。
代餐能代替三餐吗？
常见的两个代餐使用场景一是「不想 / 不能 / 不愿意做饭」，另一是「减脂和 / 或体重控制」。有关前者的讨论已有不少。感兴趣的读者可移步阅读下列一些文章。
  
以代餐完全取代三餐有一个前提，就是你选择的产品应该成分可靠、营养全面、配比合理。不过很遗憾，常规的商业代餐产品如 Soylent 或若饭都很难达到这个要求。Soylent 液体版（每瓶 414 毫升，提供 400 千卡热量）的碳水、蛋白质和脂肪供能比为 35%-19%-46%，若饭的供能比之类似。根据《中国居民膳食营养素参考摄入量（2017 年发布）》，18-60 岁成年人每日通过脂肪摄入的热量占比不应超过 30%，碳水化合物的供能比最低…</span>

Flutter 3.3 正式发布啦，本次更新带来了 Flutter Web、桌面、文本性能处理等相关更新，另外，本次还为 go_router 、DevTools 和 VS Code 扩展引入了更多更新。
Framework
Global Selection
Flutter Web 在之前的版本中，经常会有选择文本时与预期的行为不匹配的情况，因为与 Flutter  App 一样，原生 Web 是由 elements 树组成。
在传统的 Web 应用中，开发者可以通过一个拖动手势选择多个 Web 元素，但这在 Flutter Web 上无法轻松完成。
但是从 3.3 开始，随着SelectableArea 的引入， SelectableArea Widget 的任何 Child 都可以自由启用改能力。

要利用这个强大的新特性，只需使用 SelectionArea 嵌套你的页面，比如路由下的 Scaffold，然后让 Flutter 就会完成剩下的工作。
要更全面地深入了解这个新功能，请访问 SelectableArea API
触控板输入
Flutter 3.3 改进了对触控板输入的支持，这不仅提供了更丰富和更流畅的控制逻辑，还减少了某些情况下的错误识别。
举个例子，在  Flutter cookbook  中拖动 UI 元素页面，滚动到页面底部，然后执行以下步骤：
缩小窗口大小，使上部呈现滚动条
悬停在上部
使用触控板滚动
在 Flutter 3.3 之前，在触控板上滚动会拖动项目，因为 Flutter 正在调度模拟的一般事件
Flutter 3.3 后，在触控板上滚动会正确滚动列表，因为 Flut…</span>

                              <span>A Lava-Lamp menu contains an indicator that moves to the selected position when we select an option.
We can see this type of navigation, (for example) in the AppleTV interface.
Still not clear? Take a look at this demo:

Samsung’s bringing more content to TV Plus, its free, ad-supported streaming package that’s built into a range of Samsung devices and available on the web. The update introduces several new shows, such as Top Gear, Law &amp; Order Special Victims Unit, NCIS, and Chicago Fire.
In addition to the new shows, TV Plus is getting two exclusive Samsung-owned channels: Ride or Drive, a station geared toward car fans, and Samsung Showcase, a channel dedicated to “concerts, events, and special programming.” It’s also partnering with A&amp;E to launch a new home improvement-focused channel, called Home.Made.Nation.
And while Samsung already offers several local and nationwide news channels, including ABC News Live, CBS News, NBC News Now, and more, Samsung...

Royal Caribbean, the cruise company that also operates Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises, has announced that it’ll be outfitting its fleet of ships with SpaceX’s Starlink internet service (via TechCrunch). The company says the service will make the internet experience while at sea faster and more reliable.
Royal Caribbean seems to be moving full steam ahead with deploying Starlink — it trialed the service on one of its ships over the summer, and will be officially launching it on September 5th, starting with a ship called the Celebrity Beyond. The company expects to have the service fully deployed across its fleet by the first quarter of 2023.

Netflix has found an executive to lead its plan for an ad-supported tier: Snap’s chief business officer and top ad exec, Jeremi Gorman. 
Gorman on Tuesday told colleagues at Snap that she was leaving to join Netflix along with Peter Naylor, Snap’s vice president of ad sales for the Americas, according to two people familiar with the matter. Russ Caditz-Peck, a Snap spokesperson, confirmed the departures.

Hanx101 Trivia, a trivia game that is narrated by actor Tom Hanks, will soon be one of the games exclusively available on the Apple Arcade subscription service (via Variety). Despite the name, it’s not a game dedicated to quizzing you about Hanks’ career — a press release from the game’s developer, Blueline Studios, says it’ll feature “tens of thousands of questions” about subjects like history, math, geography, and food. (I’m hoping the later set contains at least one question about a box of chocolate.)
The game will feature a head-to-head competition mode, a team mode, and a “Hanx101 mode” where you apparently try to get a high score while answering 101 questions. There will also apparently be “unique formats such as ‘Word Jam’ and ‘I...

Snap is planning to lay off approximately 20 percent of its more than 6,400 employees, according to people familiar with the matter.
The layoffs, which Snap has been planning for the past several weeks, will begin on Wednesday and hit some departments harder than others, the people said. For example, the team working on ways for developers to build mini apps and games inside Snapchat will be severely impacted. Zenly, the social mapping app Snap bought in 2017 and has since run separately, will also see deep cuts.
Another team that will see layoffs is Snap’s hardware division, which is responsible for its AR Spectacles glasses and the Pixy camera drone that was recently canceled after being on sale for just a few months. The company’s ad...

A Virginia judge has dismissed an unusual case that could have banned selling two books to children in the state. Following a hearing on Tuesday, Virginia Beach Circuit Court Judge Pamela Baskervill found that Maia Kobabe’s Gender Queer: A Memoir and Sarah Maas’ A Court of Mist and Fury failed to meet the standard for obscenity under Virginia law — and, more consequentially, that the obscenity law itself was unconstitutional.
Republican State Delegate Tim Anderson and former congressional candidate Tommy Altman instigated the dispute earlier this year, exploiting a little-used rule that allows anyone to launch obscenity proceedings in the state. Altman and Anderson objected to what they characterized as sexually explicit material in both...

Truth Social is strapped for cash and facing a mountain of tech and legal troubles that could doom the future of former president Donald Trump’s personal social media platform.
The most immediate problem is the platform’s stalled SPAC, initially planned as a way to publicly trade shares in the new company without the diligence of an IPO. But the SPAC has been delayed, leaving the Digital World Acquisition Corp., which was projected to take ownership of Truth Social, in an awkward position. SEC filings show that the company has lost over $6 million in the first half of this year, hasn’t generated any revenue, and holds only $293 million in a trust that houses most of its assets. 
DWAC’s stock price has shed nearly 75 percent of its value...

Logitech has three new gaming mice, and the wireless ones finally have USB-C up front. That’s right, Micro USB’s reign of terror continues to be on the decline as Logitech’s new G502 X series gaming mice come to succeed the company’s popular G502 line.
The three mice — G502 X, G502 X Lightspeed, and G502 X Plus — also now include hybrid optical-mechanical buttons for greater responsiveness as well as a more precise 25,600 dpi “Hero 25K” sensor. They’ll have an overall lighter weight and come in both black and white.
While the mice sport the company’s new “Lightforce” hybrid optical-mechanical switches that are designed to utilize the speed of optical technology, they also include the clicking satisfaction of a traditional mouse button....

一、前言
上一篇文章 Compose回忆童年 - 手拉灯绳-开灯/关灯里面82年钨丝灯，让我又有了新的想法，我们怎么照亮手机里面的文本内容呢？
我们会在上一篇文章的基础上来实现“挑灯夜看”的功能，怎么下手呢？往下看👇
二、文本着色器
我们想要实现照亮功能，那肯定需要有不亮的文本内容。
通过透明度来可以吗？肯定不行，文本内容是可以上下滑动的，是一个整体，我们不能通过透明度来做。
在看到小米手机的文本着色效果之后：

我知道如何下手了，我先来看看Compose的Text如何做渐变着色？
1. 有些同学可能喜欢用Canvas去绘制：
Canvas(...) {
   drawIntoCanvas { canvas -&gt;
       canvas.nativeCanvas.drawText(text, x, y, paint)
   }
}

2. 我们可以使用Modifeir的drawWithCache修饰符，官方文档的链接里面也给我们了不少示例。

Text(
    text &#x3D; &quot;永远相信美好的事情即将发生❤️&quot;,
    modifier &#x3D; Modifier
        .graphicsLayer(alpha &#x3D; 0.99f)
        .drawWithCache {
            val brush &#x3D; Brush.horizontalGradient(
                listOf(
                     Color(0xFFE24CE2),
                     Color(0xFF73BB70),

前言
大家好，我是小彭。2 年前，我们在 为了组件化改造学习十几家大厂的技术博客 这篇文章里收集过各大厂的组件化方案。其中，有美团收银团队分享的组件化总线框架 modular-event 让我们印象深刻。然而，美团并未将该框架开源，我们只能望梅止渴。
在学习和借鉴美团 modular-event 方案中很多优秀的设计思想后，我亦发现方案中依然存在不一致风险和不足，故我决定对方案进行改进并向社区开源。项目主页为 Github · ModularEventBus，演示 Demo 可直接下载：
Demo apk。
欢迎提 Issue 帮助修复缺陷，欢迎提 Pull Request 增加新的 Feature，有用请点赞给 Star，给小彭一点创作的动力，谢谢。

很高兴遇见你~
在本系列的上一篇文章中，我们介绍了 Flutter 中常用的按钮 Widget，Flutter 1.x 和 Flutter 2.x 按钮的变化，最后通过 Flutter 1.x 相关 Button + BottomNavigationBar + FloatingActionButton 实现了一个综合案例。还没有看过上一篇文章的朋友，建议先去阅读 Flutter 系列（五）：Flutter 常用按钮 Widget。接下来我们对 Flutter 表单 Widget 进行学习
Flutter 中常见的表单有：TextField，CheckBox，Radio，Switch，CheckboxListTile，RadioListTile，SwitchListTile，Slider 等，下面就介绍一下这些常用的 Widget
一、Flutter 常用表单 Widget 介绍
1.1、TextFiled 文本框
TextFiled 是 Flutter 给我们提供的文本框 Widget，其常用的属性有：
属性名称

虽然 Firefox 仍然是 Debian 的默认浏览器，但很多 Linux 用户都会安装 Chrome 浏览器的开源上游 Chromium 浏览器。早些时候，在 Debian 中提供的 Chromium 使用谷歌作为默认搜索引擎。最近，Debian 发布公告称，“由于隐私原因，将默认搜索引擎改为 DuckDuckGo”。这个决定并不是匆忙做出的，因为这个提议是在两年前提出的，只是近日才得以通过。

法国用 AI 发现未申报的私人游泳池，开出千万欧元账单

因为建造游泳池能提高房价，意味着更高的财产税，根据法国法律，业主需要申报其建造的游泳池。2020 年法国有逾 320 万个私人游泳池，新冠疫情期间愈来愈多的人在家办公，游泳池的安装量也进一步激增。法国税务部门使用由谷歌等公司开发的 AI 软件，可以在航拍图像上识别游泳池，并与土地登记数据库进行交叉检查。结果发现了超过 2 万个未申报的私人游泳池，这些业主将收到总额约为 1000 万欧元的账单。

Web3 DNS 供应商可能失去其域名

ENS 是一种运行在以太坊上的域名服务，用于在 Web3 中便捷地访问各种地址。但是如果想在互联网上访问它，通常需要一种特别的 DNS 服务商，其中 eth.link 是使用最多的一个。但是，该域名的所有者因故入狱，因此这个域名没有办法续费，面临过期。eth.link 于 7 月 26 日到期，并将于 9 月 5 日被域名注册商收回，届时它将可能被抢注并用于恶意用途。在试图由其他人替代续费，而被域名注册商拒绝之后，ENS DAO 已经建议用户使用另外一个 eth.limo 域名作为替代。

                              <span>Bash 有一些方便的自动化功能，可以让我在 Linux 上处理文件时更轻松。


通过 Bash 命令行进行自动化任务是极好的一种方式。不论你使用运行在服务器上的 Linux 进行管理日志文件或其他文件，还是你在个人电脑上整理文件以使桌面保持整洁，使用 Bash 的自动化功能会使你的工作变得更轻松。

自动执行文件任务：for

如果你对一堆文件要同时处理，并且对每个文件进行相同的操作，请使用 for 命令。该命令会遍历文件列表，并执行一个或多个命令。for 命令如下所示：

for 变量 in 列表
do
    命令
done


我在示例中添加了额外的空白和换行，来分开 for 命令中不同的部分。看起来好像无法在命令行中同时运行多个命令，不过你可以使用 ; 将所有命令放在同一行中，就像这样:

for 变量 in 列表 ; do 命令 ; done


让我们看看它的实际效果。我使用 for 命令来重命名一些文件。最近，我有一些截图，想要重命名。这些截图名称为 filemgr.png 或 terminal.png，我想将 screenshot 放在每个名称前。我可以使用 for 命令一次性将 30 个文件重命名。这是两个文件的示例：

$ ls
filemgr.png  terminal.png
$ for f in *.png ; do mv $f screenshot-$f ; done
$ ls
screenshot-filemgr.png  screenshot-terminal.png


for 命令使得在一系列文件中执行一种或多种操作变得容易。你可以用一些有意义的变量名，比如 image 或 screenshot，或者你用示例中“缩写的”变量 f。当我在使用 for 循环写脚本的时候，会选择有意义的变量名。但是当…</span>

王兴宇：

如今国内的各个开源操作系统百花齐放，但是与国际厂商相比，大家认为我们目前的强项在哪里，弱项在哪里？

王戍靖：

近年来国内操作系统开源社区发展迅速，但发展时间短，与国际社区相比有一定差距。操作系统社区基于大量基础技术，包括芯片、编译、开发工具等基础技术领域，也包括大数据、人工智能、云计算等新兴技术方向，需要长期培育积累和技术创新。

有利条件是中国开源处于快速发展阶段，中国开发者数量增长快，据 GitHub 2021 年数据统计，中国开发者数量已增至 700 多万，排名全球第二，贡献了 550 万个开源项目；另外，我国数字经济转型升级推动信息产业持续增长，新兴技术领域也在迅速发展。以上都为国内开源操作系统社区发展提供了坚实的基础和动力。

陈鲍孜：

从主导具体的开源项目看，国内操作系统社区的发展还是有欠缺的，毕竟我们参与的时间比较短。但国内的开发人员不管从数量还是活跃程度方面，在国际上即使不是最好的，…</span>

                              <span>你如何列出 Linux 中的 USB 设备？

这个问题可以有两种含义。


你的系统上有（检测到）多少个 USB 端口？

系统安装（插入）了多少个 USB 设备/磁盘？


大多数情况下，人们有兴趣了解哪些 USB 设备连接到系统。这可能有助于对 USB 设备进行故障排除。

最可靠的方法是使用这个命令：

lsusb


它显示了网络摄像头、蓝牙和以太网端口以及 USB 端口和挂载的 USB 驱动器。



但是理解 lsusb 的输出并不容易，当你只想查看和访问已挂载的 USB 驱动器时，你可能不需要那么复杂。

我将向你展示可用于列出连接到系统的 USB 设备的各种工具和命令。

除非另有说明，在我的例子中连接了一个 2GB 的 U 盘、1TB 的外置硬盘、通过 MTP 连接的 Android 智能手机，以及 USB 鼠标。

让我从桌面用户最简单的选项开始。

以图形方式检查连接的 USB 设备

你的发行版的文件管理器可以用来查看连接到你的计算机的 USB 存储设备。正如你在下面的 Nautilus（GNOME 文件管理器）的截图中看到的那样。

连接的设备显示在边栏中（此处仅显示 USB 存储设备）。



你还可以使用 GNOME “磁盘Disks” 或 Gparted 等 GUI 应用来查看、格式化和分区连接到计算机的 USB 存储设备。默认情况下，大多数使用 GNOME 桌面环境的发行版都预装了 GNOME “磁盘”。

这个应用也可以用作一个非常好的 分区管理器。



图形工具足够了。让我们讨论可用于列出 USB 设备的命令。

使用 mount 命令列出挂载的 USB 设备

mount 命令用于挂载 Linux 中的分区。你还可以使用相同的命令列出 USB 存储设备。

通常，USB 存储挂载…</span>

Lately, I&#x27;ve been looking at how Groovy streamlines Java. In this series, I&#x27;m developing several scripts to help in cleaning up my music collection. In my last article, I used the framework developed previously to create a list of unique file names and counts of occurrences of those file names in the music collection directory. I then used the Linux find command to get rid of files I didn&#x27;t want.
In this article, I demonstrate a Groovy script to clean up the motley assembly of tag fields.
WARNING: This script alters music tags, so it is vital that you make a backup of the music collection you test your code on.

When someone needs to share their screen with you, or you need to share your screen with someone else, you have several options to choose from. Video conferencing software, like the open source Jitsi web app, and while we call that &quot;screen sharing,&quot; it&#x27;s really presenting. You&#x27;re presenting your screen to others, but they can&#x27;t interact with it. Sometimes you actually want to share your screen and your mouse cursor with a trusted friend or colleague, and the tool for that is VNC (Virtual Network Computing), and it&#x27;s built into your Linux desktop.
In any screen sharing scenario, there are two computers and possibly two users. For that reason, this article has two p…</span>

                              <span>KnotAPI, the first universal merchant API...because there&#x27;s not an API for it! 

Use KnotAPI to Change Card on File Information, Cancel Subscriptions, Change Passwords, and more. Fintechs use Knot API to grow customer spend.




We spun Knot out of Millions because our customers ran into all of these problems...so we figured, why don&#x27;t we fix it for all challenger banks? For banks this means more utilization from day one, and more revenue. 

Want to use Knot? Get in touch  or Check out our API docs!

                              <span>Zero-config support for Next.js: When you’re ready to deploy a Next.js project on Netlify, the Netlify platform automatically detects the Next.js framework and configures everything so the core features of Next.js just work with zero configuration.

⚡ Next.js Advanced Middleware: As you’re developing, you can use the &#x60;@netlify/next&#x60; package to enable Next.js Advanced Middleware. This gives you full access to the response body for HTML rewrites and page data transforms. 

💬 Unique workflow for QA and feedback: When you open a pull request, Netlify generates a deploy preview you can use both for QA and to gather feedback from your team. When stakeholders leave on-page feedback their comments sync directly to the place where your team works, like GitHub, GitLab, JIRA, Trello, or Linear. This even works for content generated by ISR and SSR! 

Here are some links to learn more:

- A better runtime for Next.js: https://www.netlify.com/blog/nextjs-advanced-middleware-better-runtime-that-extends-nextjs/

- Next.js on Netlify Docs: https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/next-js/overview/

- Starter templates and resources: https://www.netlify.com/with/nextjs/

To sum it up: Netlify&#x27;s new Next.js Runtime and Next.js Advanced Middleware give developers the power to achieve personalization use cases like localization or custom authentication in a way that requires less developer effort and delivers superior performance for end-users.

This is only the first release for Netlify&#x27;s Next.js Runtime. Expect more to come in the future! 

We’re so excited to share this moment with the Product Hunt community and would love to hear from you. What questions do you have? Could you imagine using Next.js Advanced Middleware for an upcoming project? What new features would you like to see from Netlify? 

Thank you for checking this out and joining the conversation!

Here are some of its features:

⚡️ Keyframing with custom easing
🎚 Image and video filters (adjustments, blur, chroma key...)
✂️ Trim and cut videos
👀 Layer masking
🔊 Audio support
🔍 Search for images, videos, shapes and more
✨ Text animation (typewriter, scale, fade...)
💥 Lottie support
🧩 Pixabay integration
...and much more - all for free &amp; no sign in needed!

I shared a lot of my progress building this editor in my newsletter, if you&#x27;re curious. Ultimately while I had a lot of plans for it, I realized that it was far too challenging to work with the old and outdated codebase, and I would have had to rewrite the whole thing from zero using some framework to make any substantial progress with it. So I decided to just launch it as is, for free and without any fancy gimmicks.

The code is available on GitHub if you&#x27;d like to contribute to Motionity, self-host it, or build your own motion graphics editor.

携手创作，共同成长！这是我参与「掘金日新计划 · 8 月更文挑战」的第6天，点击查看活动详情。
一、前言
之前发布的一篇Compose制作一个“IOS”效果的SwitchButton
有位掘友评论：“手势配合Animatable也可以尝试一下”

手机上我想修改之前回复的评论，没想到删除自己的评论，他的评论也没有了，准备回复的内容也没了，想着顺手写一篇和Animatable相关的文章吧。
回到本篇文章的另一个起源吧，想到小时候顺着那白色开关垂下来的灯绳，拉一下“咔哒”一声，再拉一下又是“咔哒”一声。当时年龄小感觉新奇总是把灯开了关又关了开的拉着玩，以至于好几次拉坏了开关灯绳。
今天我们在手机上做一个拉不坏的灯绳😄，怀念一下童年🤣。

二、材料准备
在App里面准备一个弹簧绳😄，我们想奢侈一下，躺在床上拉灯绳。
绳末尾底部的疙瘩，替换成：夜光球 ，毕竟现在2022年了，夜晚总不能黑灯瞎火摸着找灯绳吧，你们觉得呢？
准备一个82年的钨丝灯泡💡，拉菲也得配个82年的，才有氛围感。
三、安装82年的钨丝灯和灯绳
我们要知道材料所需要占用最大的宽度和最小宽度，可以用BoxWithConstraints做容器，里面放我们的灯泡和灯绳以及我们的“夜光球”。
我们知道BoxWidthConstraints可以获得屏幕上Composable的最小/最大可用宽度和高度，可以根据可用空间使用它来显示不同的内容。
1. 使用Image来显示我们的钨丝灯:
Image(
   alpha &#x3D; state.wsdAlpha,
   modifier &#x3D; Modifier.align(Alignment.TopCenter).size(100.dp),
   painter &#x3D; painterResource(id &#x3D; R.drawable.ic_wsd),

                              <span>微软发行的“最重”的软件重逾 18 公斤

在互联网并不发达的时候，软件的分发主要依赖于软盘或者 CD，并且其中会附有详细的纸质文档，这些文档可以达到数千页，因此导致软件非常重。据微软披露，它至今发行的最大软件是 1992 年发行的 Microsoft C/C++ 编译器及 Windows SDK，重逾 18 公斤，该软件放在一个长度超过 60 厘米的盒子里。


消息来源：PCMag



老王点评：这软件果然“重量级”。不过现在的软件都没有了介质，你是否“拥有”一个软件有时候并不确定，比如说云软件、订阅软件。还真是怀念当年计算机爱好者们背着几盒软盘彼此交流的时候。




谷歌开源识别各种加密产品漏洞的 Paranoid

Paranoid 项目可以检测任意加密产品，甚至包括那些源代码没有公开的系统生成的加密产品。它支持测试数字签名、通用伪随机数和公钥等多种类型的加密产品，可以识别由编程错误或使用弱专有随机数生成器引起的问题。谷歌使用 Paranoid 从证书透明度项目中检查了超过 70 亿个证书的加密产品，并发现了数千个受到严重和高严重性 RSA 公钥漏洞影响的项目。


消息来源：谷歌



老王点评：这让我想起来前两天现代汽车中使用硬编码的示例密钥进行加密的事情，要是经过了 Paranoid 的检查，想必不会出现这种低级错误了吧。




Ubuntu 22.10 禁用 GNOME 43 中的设备安全提示功能

GNOME 43 中提供了一个“设备安全”提示功能，可以对是否启用了安全启动、TPM 等设备安全功能给出警告。正在开发中的 Ubuntu 22.10 会采用 GNOME 43，但开发者表示将先禁用这个“设备安全”提示功能。这是因为要获得最高的安全级别 3 需要英特尔 BootGuard、TPM 重建、IOMMU 保护、启动前 DMA 保护、英特尔 CET、暂停到闲置、加密内存等功能，而 Ubuntu 22.10 目前只能达到安全级别 1。甚至如果用户试图调整系统达到更高的安全性，也可能会破坏系统。因此，Ubuntu 可能会在以后才支持该功能。

老王点评：虽然说过于理想化的安全设置可能不切实际，但是这些安全功能可以在现代的 Windows 上正常运行，而在 Ubuntu 上却无法很好的工作。这说明，虽然我们觉得 Windows 安全性不好，但是很可能实际上并非如此 —— 只是用的人多罢了。</span>

                              <span>Wii U 模拟器 Cemu 的开发者上周二宣布了一个重要的 2.0 版本发布，首次交付了 Linux 上的二进制文件，并开源了他们八年的成果。Cemu 是一个 Wii U 模拟器，并于 2017 年创造了历史 —— 每个月可以通过 Patreon 获得支持其发展的数千美元赞助。Cemu 以其在 Patreon 上曾短暂达到 25,000 美元的最高收入而为人所知，这引起了人们对“仿真是否道德”的关注，特别是它被用来换取金钱，而项目却是“闭源的”而不是“开源”的 —— 也就是说源代码没有向公众开放。

仿真社区保护自己免受法律诉讼的主要方式之一是向公众提供其源代码，允许像任天堂这样的“诉讼公司”检查它，并验证在反向工程过程中没有使用他们的专有代码。

据 Exzap 称，Cemu 对 Linux 的支持“仍然相当粗糙”，但他相信随着更多的模拟器开发者熟悉 Cemu，并开始为该项目做出贡献，这种情况将迅速改变。Cemu 以前只兼容 Windows，但现在支持 Linux，可以在 Steam Deck 上快速安装。在 Cemu 引入 Flatpak 支持一键安装之前，在 Deck 上使用它并不那么简单，不过这个话题已经在 GitHub 上讨论过了。

Cemu 的作者利用 2.0 发布公告简要地讨论了该模拟器的历史；在该模拟器的大部分历史中，他们是唯一的开发者，他们声称过去两年对项目的压力特别大。

Exzap 将继续做出贡献，但预计拥有其他开发者将有助于创建几个重要的功能，如暂停和恢复仿真的能力，以及提高在旧硬件上的性能。

“我已经在 Cemu 上工作了近 8 年，看着这个项目从一个似乎不可行的实验，发展到在其高峰期有超过一百万人使用的东西，”Exzap 在上周二的公告中写道，“即使在今天，当 Wii U 已经被大部分人遗忘的时候，我们每个月仍然有 25 万次下载。仍然有这么多人在用 Cemu 享受 Wii U 游戏，我将永远感激让我有机会以积极的方式影响这么多人的生活，哪怕只是一丁点。”

                              <span>在 Linux 中安装和应用现代的漂亮的 GRUB 主题。


GRUB ，意即 大统一引导程序GRand Unified Bootloader ，它是大多数 Linux 操作系统的默认引导加载程序。GRUB 引导加载程序是计算机启动时运行的第一个程序。正如你可能注意到的，GRUB 菜单的默认主题是朴素的。它只有一个黑色的背景和一些白色的字符。你们中的一些人可能不喜欢默认的 GRUB 主题。在这篇教程中，我将演示如何 更改 GRUB 主题 或应用华丽的主题，以使你的 GRUB 菜单在 Linux 中更加精美。

数年前，我们发布了一篇指南，阐释了如何在 Ubuntu 中 配置 GRUB2 引导加载程序设置 。在这篇文章中，我们将向你展示如何更改 GRUB 背景。

但是，只更改背景不是真正的自定义。在这篇指南中，我们不仅会更改壁纸，也会更改 GRUB 的字体、主题和整体的设计。


免责声明： 安装 GRUB 主题可能会破坏你的系统。我强烈建议你在一个虚拟机中尝试和测试一个主题来查看它是否没有正常工作。然后再在实际的系统上安装主题。


介绍

在互联网上可以找到很多社区开发的 GRUB 主题。然而，它们却散落在不同的网站上。因此，找到一个好的 GRUB 主题可能会事倍功半。

GRUB 主题的一个重要的贡献者是 Pling 网站。但是，Pling 中的大部分主题是非常简单的或过时的。

幸运的是，我遇到一个名称为 Gorgeous GRUB 的项目，它是一个可以找到各种精美的 GRUB 主题的地方。相信我，作者付出了巨大的努力来收集这些主题，肯定会你喜欢的主题。

In this series, I&#x27;m developing several scripts to help in cleaning up my music collection. In the last article, we used the framework created for analyzing the directory and sub-directories of music files, checking to make sure each album has a cover.jpg file and recording any other files that aren&#x27;t FLAC, MP3, or OGG.
I uncovered a few files that can obviously be deleted—I see the odd foo lying around—and a bunch of PDFs, PNGs, and JPGs that are album art. With that in mind, and thinking about the cruft removal task, I offer an improved script that uses a Groovy map to record file names and counts of their occurrences and print that in CSV form…</span>

When you have a lot of related files, it&#x27;s sometimes easier to treat them as a single object rather than 3 or 20 or 100 unique files. There are fewer clicks involved, for instance, when you email one file compared to the mouse work required to email 30 separate files. This quandary was solved decades ago when programmers invented a way to create an archive, and so the tar command was born (the name stands for tape archive because back then, files were saved to magnetic tape.) Today tar remains a useful way to bundle files together, whether it&#x27;s to compress them so they take up less space on your drive, to make it easier to deal with lots of files, or to logically group…</span>

                              <span>Hi 大家好，我是 3x3 的作者 KIDSTYO
在2022年初的时候，我制作发布了自己的第一款苹果平台应用 3x3
这是一款采用极简主义设计风格（参考Windows Phone）的时间管理应用
在此之前，我在少数派上看到很多朋友都在用自己的方式结合市面上的工具来搭建自己的时间管理体系
其中有一些关键词，比如间歇式日记、柳比歇夫时间记录法、双链等
其中一些理念，让我觉得和 3x3 的理念很类似，所以也是经过半年多的迭代完善后，想向各位介绍这款工具
我自己不太会写文章，所以这篇文章的内容可能会比较简单
我希望能分享一下我为什么要做这个软件以及分享我自己和一些用户的使用体验
3x3 的理念
首先我想分享一段话，这正是 3x3 核心理念：dots will somehow connect in your future

You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.

3x3 可以轻松的记录日常的时间线，可以关联每日、周、月、年、甚至人生的待办或者标签，并且待办之间可以进行双向链接
做3x3的想法就是，过了很多年之后，我还可以方便的找到当天做过有意义的事情
然后可以将所有事情串联起来，比如我学习一样事情，阅读一本书，可以清晰的知道每个阶段的过程，甚至你可以制作你自己的10000小时计划
3x3 的设计想法在 2018 年初，就有了，当时我还做了一个简单的网页，它…</span>

                              <span>在 WWDC22 上，Apple 发布 iOS 16 的时候，公布了一个功能叫实时活动，并向开发者开放 Live Activities API。

那么什么实时活动呢？
实时活动是一种新的交互式消息通知，用户可以在 iPhone 的锁屏界面看到事件的实时更新。比如球赛的比分、打车或订餐的订单状态、运动锻炼的实时数据等。这种消息通知形式允许开发者在实时活动期间更新单个交互式通知，而不是每次有状态更新时都发送新通知。通过减少发送的通知数量，同时使信息更易于访问。
Uber海外版团队设计的实时活动界面
Apple 在 iOS 16 开发者测试版 Beta 4 首次向开发者提供 ActivityKit 开发套件，首次在真机实装，随后在 Beta 6 和 Beta 7 并没有在真机实装实时活动功能。开发者目前只能在模拟器测试这项功能，或者降级回 Beta 4 或 Beta 5。Apple 在开发者网站也明确表示实时活动不会在首个 iOS16 正式版推出，而是在今年晚些时候的正式版突出。下图是模仿目前已有的原神安卓小组件、iOS 小组件做的实时活动版小组件。到了 8 月 16 日一大早用手机更新 Beta 6 之后，手机就不能运行和测试实时活动了，随后也看到其他开发者反馈实时活动在 Beta 6 版本没有实装。本文后面的截图只能在模拟器截取了，但模拟器不能更改壁纸，只有黑色背景。
Xcode真机调试报错ActivityKit没实装
实时活动界面部分是小组件扩展，开发者使用 WidgetKit 功能和 SwiftUI 编写界面布局，ActivityKit 是处理配置、启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动是一种消息通知，是一种可以自定义界面布局和更新状态的消息通知。下图是普通类型的消息通知，或许以后能看到换了界面布局的降雨提醒。
普通的消息通知类型
实时活动要求和限制
与小组件不同的是，小组件是通过时间线机制更新界面数据，实时活动是通过远程推送或 ActivityKit 从主应用程序来启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动无法访问网络或接收位置更新，下图网络请求图片失败。

ActivityKit 更新和远程推送通知更新的更新动态数据大小不能超过 4KB。
实时活动界面不能包含可交互元素，例如按钮和 WebView。当用户点击实时活动界面，将会打开主应用程序。
自定义实时活动的用户界面时，系统会忽略任何自定义动画，但可以使用系统自带的时间文本动画，当实时活动的动态内容发生变化时，系统会执行一些动画。文本视图通过模糊的内容过渡动画内容变化，系统为图像和 SF Symbols 符号动画内容过渡，根据内容或状态更改从用户界面添加或删除视图，视图会淡入淡出。
系统自带的时间文本动画系统为图像内容变化作出的动画效果
在开发者网站的描述中，如果实时活动的高度超过 160，系统可能会截断它。在实际测试中，实时活动界面最小高度为 64，最大高度可以达到 220。目前实时活动功能还不是正式的版本，有可能在之后的测试版本会有改变。

当用户在 App 首次启动时，点击允许应用程序发送通知时，就代表允许 App 发送实时活动通知，不允许则不会收到实时活动的通知。之后在系统设置 - 对应的 App -实时活动，可以关闭/开启实时活动权限。
实时活动权限位置
实时活动有 4 种活动状态，分别是：等待中、正在进行、成功、失败
实时活动在锁屏界面显示的时候，用户可以左划，点击清除按钮将其清除。用户没有清除的情况下，实时活动最多可以处于活动状态 8 小时，如果用户或应用程序尚未结束活动状态，系统会自动结束它。在此结束状态下，实时活动会在锁定屏幕上最多保留 4 个小时，最后系统会将其删除。

目前实时活动功能还在测试状态，开发者们还在为他们的 App 设计和测试这一项功能，下图是收集几款目前在测试中的实时活动的例子。

关于实时活动这一功能的一些设想。在这个功能正式上线后，除了官方和大部分媒体提到的比赛比分、运动训练状态、行程状态、订单状态等这些功能以外，我们或许还可以看到这些功能：某餐饮 App 提醒你周四中午吃啥；原神体力、宝钱、参量质变仪到点提示上线领取；购物平台推送提醒商品抢购即将开启、正在抢购还剩余 69 件并且在不断减少等之类的功能。

以上就是关于实时活动这个功能的一些介绍和想法。之前的一篇锁屏天气的文章和视频会有评论说解锁在桌面小组件就能看到天气了啊，左划负一屏添加小组件就能看到天气了啊。不过对于我这种手机懒得解锁的用户来说，对于锁屏实时活动这个功能是非常期待的。大家对于实时活动这个系统特性及功能有什么想法和期待呢？</span>

                              <span>在我看来，Nreal Air 眼镜是一个非常「简单」、非常「聪明」的产品
包装大全套
拿到 Nreal Air 有几天时间了，老实讲等快递到那几天是很激动的，这不是我第一次使用 Nreal 眼镜了，在 2019 年的时候，我非常有幸去北京拜访过 Nreal，期间短暂的体验过 Nreal Air 的前身，当时的 demo 版本已经非常接近现在的样子，给我留下了非常深刻的印象。
如今，在我体验了一段时间，新鲜感消失之后，重新审视这个产品时，我觉得他们做了一些非常漂亮的取舍，得以让 Nreal Air 能够脱离小众，走向大众的视野。这在我的印象当中，可能是这个品类的第一次。并且在苹果发布他们的 AR 眼镜之前，分析一下 Nreal 的每一个选择背后的原因，想想苹果在面对取舍时会怎么选择，这是一个非常好的参照。

取舍
从用户端的需求来说，其实第一个选择非常简单：AR 眼镜到底能干什么？或者说我期望用户能用 AR 眼镜来做什么？
这个问题是简单的，但要回答清楚也是困难的。做产品定义时，产品经理大可以做一些「元宇宙」式的幻想：我希望 AR 眼镜是信息的入口，用户可以活在里面。这个回答可能没错，但是稍微认清一些现实的话，做到这一步是要有非常多的前提的，「元宇宙」里面的内容谁来填充？芯片是否具备这么高的算力能够渲染出丰富的画面？光机是不是能把这些画面精细的显示出来？这几个灵魂拷问可能就连产业巨头都只能兼顾 1-2 个，更别提 Nreal 只是一个 2017 年成立的创业公司了。
所以结合现实，他们的答案是，优先把画面显示好，内容生态寻求合作伙伴补充。
在这个答案的背后，就是他们两个最重要产品取舍：
1. 不在眼镜里集成计算模块和电池，将计算的部分放进用户固有设备中，如手机、平板。
2. 不做无线投屏，采用有线链接，保证稳定性和低延迟

这么选择一个重要的好处就是成本直接少一大块，反映到实…</span>

                              <span>「本文参与数字文具盒征文活动」
背景
成为少数派 Matrix 作者已经两年有余。回想起在少数派发表的第一篇文章，也是因为征文活动「无限桌面」有感而发，简单介绍了一下当时身在国内，日夜颠倒网课学习时的桌面布置。两年过去了，我已经回到了美国，也从当时的学校毕业，进入到新的学校，开启了人生的一个新阶段。 
新闻传媒，英文名叫做「Journalism」，是一门专门学习新闻报道和写作的学科。而除了学校里开设的各类理论和实践课之外，最好的学习方法就是平时的阅读积累。在我将新闻传媒定为自己学习的方向之后，我便开始有意识地通过各种渠道获取内容，加深自己对于新闻事件的理解，同时也学习职业记者们的写作风格。几年下来，我也有了一套独属于自己的系统。这次少数派的征文主题是「数字文具盒」，那我也趁这个机会，聊一聊自己作为一个新闻传媒系的学生，是如何使用数字工具来搭建自己的阅读和写作系统的。
按照工具和媒体的性质，我把自己的「数字文具盒」简单分为四个步骤：获取内容，收集内容，处理内容，以及产出内容。
我的阅读与写作系统的简单流程图
获取内容
阅读理解新闻的第一步，当然是要找到优质的信息渠道。我目前常用的渠道主要有四个：传统媒体，播客，书籍，以及社交媒体。
传统媒体，指的就是规模大，存在时间久，以报道新闻为主要目的的媒体。我订阅的传统媒体有三家：纽约时报 New York Times，华尔街日报 The Wall Street Journal， 以及大西洋杂志 The Atlantic。 纽约时报作为美国发行量最大的报纸之一，文章质量有一定的保证，并且汇集了许多美国最知名的专栏作家。我每天都会阅读它的早间资讯 Morning Briefing 和 On Politics 两份 newsletter。但因为它的受众主要是美国的自由派人士，文章导向非常明显。而华尔街日报专注于商务人士，文章也偏向保守。大西…</span>

                              <span>实事求是 or 上纲上线
我已经很难有动力去解释和反驳，自从明确意识到某些人就是故意不实事求是好好说话，动辄上纲上线占道德制高点对你劈头盖脸一顿叨叨图一时嘴快。
我对一些框架设计的不合理提出尖锐批评和改善建议，我觉得这么做合情合理。然而某些人就是故意抓住所谓漏洞进行人身攻击、扣帽、批斗，试图把人搞臭然后踩上一万只脚。
为什么会有语言霸凌、网络暴力
人是生物，生物是基因载体，基因本就有追求优越性的需要，所以人本来就有存在感和优越感需求。
常人通常选择做利人利己之事，这里面自动隐含存在感和优越感，无需特意索取，
但如果体质易缺乏优越感，就特容易感到难受，随时急需优越感补给，于是就有了这类钻营来得快优越，
基于生物节能本能，无一例外摸索出最低成本最短路径 —— 网络霸凌 / 逞口舌之快 / 论人是非，
常见套路即，动辄臆想和放大某杠点（例如 阴谋 / 愚蠢 / 不够 / 不公），然后拿着这杠点抬杠锤人，
这过程自动将自己置于道德制高点，自动彰显自己的存在和优越。评论区点赞站队的人越多，就越是让路径得到强化，越来越依赖这种方式获来得快优越，越来越无底线，
不分青红皂白，上来就是贴标签，扣帽子，通过各种言外之意给人泼脏水，刻意营造一副此人是什么什么的形象，
在场其他同类见有人被欺辱，往往就像鲨鱼闻见血腥一样，冒头各种扮好人、扮目击者、扮高人、扮理中客，都来分一杯羹让自己嘴爽，不分白不分。
互联网创作者生存现状
网上多是不发声的常人和有动力抬杠锤人的人，所以就是在这样环境下，创作者开始变得圆滑，不再发表有观点、有态度、有逻辑的文章，而是顺着爱发表意见的人的心意，去除各种观点、态度、逻辑，让文章看起来 “对的东西” 好像都有提到，很容易让人感觉愉悦和舒服。
当下互联网无异于 “党同伐异、对人不对事” 的世界，很难再有人沉下心学习，上网冲浪无非就是在信息茧房中找认同、喷异端，以彰显自身的正…</span>

                              <span>Ktor官方对Ktor的描述是：
Create asynchronous client and server applications. Anything from microservices to multiplatform HTTP client apps in a simple way. Open Source, free, and fun!
创建异步客户端和和服务器应用，从微服务到多平台HTTP客户端应用程序都可以用一种简单的方式完成。开源、免费、有趣！
它具有轻量级+可扩展性强+多平台+异步的特性。
轻量级和可扩展性是因为它的内核比较简单，并且当需要一些功能的时候可以加入别的插件到项目中，并不会造成功能冗余。并且Ktor的扩展是使用插拔的方式，使用起来非常简单！
异步，Ktor内部是使用Kotlin协程来实现异步，这对于熟悉Kotlin的Android开发非常友好。
看到这里可能一头雾水，下面将用一个比较简单的例子来带大家入坑Ktor！等看完这篇文章之后就会对Ktor的这些特性有进一步的了解。

前言
很高兴遇见你~
众所周知，RxJava 是一个非常流行的第三方开源库，它能将复杂的逻辑简单化，提高我们的开发效率，一个这么好用的库，来让我们学习一下吧🍺
下面我抛出一些问题，如果你都知道，那么恭喜你，你对 RxJava 掌握的很透彻，如果你对下面这些问题有一些疑惑，那么你就可以接着往下看，我会由浅入深的给你讲解 RxJava，看完之后，这些问题你会非常明了
1、什么是观察者模式？什么是装饰者模式？
2、观察者模式，装饰者模式在 RxJava 中的应用？
3、RxJava map 和 flatMap 操作符有啥区别？
4、如果有多个 subscribeOn ，会是一种什么情况？为啥？
5、如果有多个 observeOn ，会是一种什么情况？为啥？
6、RxJava 框架流思想设计？
7、RxJava 的 Subject 是什么？
8、如何通过 RxJava 实现一个自己的事件总线？
一、设计模式介绍
我们先了解一下下面两种设计模式：
1、观察者模式
2、装饰者模式
1.1、观察者模式
1.1.1、观察者模式定义
简单的理解：对象间存在一种一对多的依赖关系，当一个对象的状态发生改变时，所有依赖于它的对象都会得到通知并被自动更新
1.1.2、观察者模式示例
//1、定义一个观察者的接口
interface Observer {
    /**
     * 接收事件的方法
     */
    fun onChange(o: Any)
}

//2、定义一个被观察者的接口
interface Observable {
    /**
     * 添加观察者
     */
    fun addObserver(observer: Obser…</span>

Debian 目前在其系统上默认不加载非自由固件，“即使这意味着，没有这些二进制组件就没有硬件支持/加速能力。不加载非自由固件也可能意味着错过安全更新或解决可用性问题。”现在，Debian 社区正在讨论关于未来如何处理非自由固件的不同做法，包括默认提供并启用非自由固件，取代现有镜像或增加新的带非自由固件的镜像等等。

数万个 WordPress 网站使用了恶意插件

研究人员在 24931 个 WordPress 网站上发现了 47337 个恶意插件，每一个被攻击的网站都有两个或更多被感染的插件。而且，这些插件中有 94% 仍在积极地感染新的网站。研究还发现，这些恶意插件要么是在公开市场上出售的，要么是从盗版网站上传播的，通过利用漏洞注入网站，或者在大多数情况下，在插件被添加到网站后被感染。恶意软件会攻击网站上的其他插件来传播感染，他们的数据集中有超过 4 万个插件被证明是在部署后感染的。

老王点评：通过插件的互相传染，所以，不要轻易下载任何不可靠的插件，尤其是盗版的。

                              <span>今天来看个需求，如何判断 Activity 上面是否有弹窗，当然，简单的方式肯定有，例如在 Dialog  show 的时候记录一下，但这种方式不够优雅，我们需要一款更通用的判断方式。
Android 目前的弹窗有如下几种：
普通的应用窗口，如 Dialog
附加与普通窗口的子窗口，如 PopWindow
系统窗口，如 WindowManager type 在 FIRST_SYSTEM_WINDOW 与 LAST_SYSTEM_WINDOW 之间
通过图来简单来了解下 Window 和 View 的关系：

Activity 在 attach 阶段创建了 PhoneWindow，并将 AppToken 存储到 PhoneWindow 中，然后通过 createLocalWindowManager 创建了一个本地的 WindowManager，该实例是 WindowManagerImpl，构造传入的 parentWindow 为 PhoneWindow。在 onResume 阶段时，从 PhoneWindow 中获取 WindowManager 来 addView
Dialog 有自己的 PhoneWindow，但 Dialog 并没有从 PhoneWindow 中去 get WindowManager，而是直接使用 getSystemService 拿到 Activity 的 WindowManager 来 addView
PopWindow 内部是通过 getSystemService 来拿到 Activity WindowManager + 内置子窗口 type 来实现的弹框
方案 1、通过 mView 集合中的 Activity 区间来判断
从上面我们可以简单了解到，当前进程所有窗口 View，最终都会被存储到 WindowManagerGlobal 单例的 mVie…</span>

Compose的诞生
在2019年的谷歌IO大会上，Compose作为Android新一代UI开发亮相，因为声明式开发越来越流行了，对标IOS开发SwiftUi，Compose的立项也为Android开发新加了声明式ui的开发选项，在2021年7月1.0正式版本的诞生，也意味着Compose即将进入生产环节，国际app巨头Twitter就首当其冲，在新页面上用上了Compose
Compose好处
与传统的xml相比，Compose不仅吸收了其优点，摒弃了糟粕，还具有以下几个优点
声明式
兼容性
跨平台
布局效率




不同于传统的命令式，ui的刷新需要调用者主动调用刷新方法，比如TextView需要特定的setText进行文本变化，而compose在定义好声明状态后，由框架自主调用刷新，减少状态不一致
compose最低兼容到android api 21，不但可以在原来View体系中嫁接使用，也可以在compose中使用原来View体系的xml
跨平台，目前支持macos等多个平台，跨平台由Jetbrain团队在做，compose未来会实现ui多跨平台，同时也搭配逻辑跨平台KMM项目（有关kmm的以后有机会可以再说说，比起说跨平台，更不如说是多平台，因为编译出来的代码是直接符合原平台开发规范的，比如ios编译出来的就是framework），未来实现ui跟逻辑都跨平台也不在遥远
compose 是严格遵循LayoutNode的单次测量，不会出现View的多次测量导致的问题，在ui卡顿或者ui规范上，是非常重要的改进



因为Compose是Android团队与JetBrain在推，国内外的学习热情都挺好，目前国内也有不少大厂进行了尝试阶段，比如字节。

In my previous article, I created a framework for analyzing the directories and subdirectories of music files, using the groovy.File class, which extends and streamlines java.File and simplifies its use. In this article, I use the open source JAudiotagger library to analyze the tags of the music files in the music directory and subdirectories. Be sure to read the first article in this series if you intend to follow along.

前言
在我的项目 隐云图解制作 中，有一个功能是按照一定规则将多张 gif 拼接成一张 gif。
当然，这里说的拼接是类似于拼图一样的拼接，而不是简单粗暴的把多个 gif 合成一个 gif 并按顺序播放。
大致效果如下：

注意：上面的动图只展示了预览效果，没有展示实际合成效果，但是合成效果和预览效果是一摸一样的，有兴趣的话，我可以再开一篇文章讲解怎么实现这个预览效果
实现方法
FFmpeg 简介
在开始之前先简单介绍一下什么是 FFmpeg，不过我相信只要是稍微接触过一点音视频的开发者都知道 FFmpeg。
FFmpeg 是一个开放源代码的自由软件，可以执行音频和视频多种格式的录影、转换、串流功能，包含了 libavcodec ——这是一个用于多个项目中音频和视频的解码器库，以及 libavformat ——一个音频与视频格式转换库。
简单来说，只要是和音视频相关的操作，几乎都可以使用 FFmpeg 来实现。
当然，FFmpeg 是一个纯命令行工具，所以我在这里简单介绍几个本文需要用到的参数：
-y 若指定的输出文件已存在则强制覆盖
-i 设置输入文件，可以设置多个
-filter_complex 设置复杂滤镜，我们这次要实现的拼接 gif 就是依靠这个参数完成
在安卓中使用 FFmpeg
我现在使用的库是 ffmpeg-kit 使用这个库可以直接集成 FFmpeg 到项目中，并且能够方便的执行 FFmpeg 命令。
该库执行 FFmpeg 很简单，只需要：
val session &#x3D; FFmpegKit.executeWithArguments(&quot;your cmd text&quot;)
if (ReturnCode.isSuccess(session.returnCode)) {

概述
最近线上监控发现 OOM 涨幅较大，因此去尝试定位和修复这个问题，在修复了一些内存泄漏和大对象占用问题后, OOM 依旧未达到正常标准，在这些新上报的 hprof 文件中，发现几乎所有 case 中都有个叫 FinalizerReference 的对象，数量巨多，内存占用高居首位，因此判断它就是引起本次 OOM 上涨的罪魁祸首。

ReferenceQueue
首先前置了解下 ReferenceQueue 引用队列是个啥，简言之就是用来存放 Reference 对象的队列，当 Reference 对象所引用的对象被 GC 回收时，该 Reference 对象就会被加入到引用队列 ReferenceQueue 中。即：
val queue &#x3D; ReferenceQueue()
val bean &#x3D; Bean()
val reference &#x3D; SoftReference(bean, queue)

上述代码中创建了一个 bean 强引用，以及一个 reference 软引用，当 bean 被回收时，该软引用 reference 对象会被放到 queue 队列中，后续该 reference 对象需要开发者自行处理(如从队列中 poll 等)。
Leakcanary 检测内存泄漏的原理就是应用的 ReferenceQueue 引用队列，以 Activity 为例：
监听 Activity 的生命周期。
在 onDestory 的时候，通过 ReferenceQueue 来创建对应 Actitity 的 Refrence 引用对象。
一段时间后，从 ReferenceQueue 中读取，如果有这个 Actitity 的 Refrence，那么说明这个 Activity 的 Refrence 已经被…</span>

平时开发遇到一些问题，比如
怎么确认引入的第三方so是否适配32/64位
怎么知道第三方库申请了那些权限
每次开发引入的图片怎么一键压缩并自动引入项目内，并且每次使用不会重复压缩
每次写项目都会创建shape,而这个shape很可能同事写过我不知道又写了一遍，很可能一个项目中存在很多重复的shape，只是命名不同，该如何找到这些重复的shape
针对上方问题，再结合gradle插件开发了一个插件工具，可以解决这些问题，在这里分享出来，希望可以帮助到更多人
使用
引入库
在根目录的build.gradle 引入
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath &quot;com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.2.2&quot;
        //引入这个库
        classpath &quot;io.githunb.renxh4:compress_png:0.0.5&quot;
    }
}

在app的build.gradle引入插件
apply plugin: &#x27;com.ren.xh.plugin&#x27;

xh{
    tinifyId &#x3D; &quot;wQdHz6dkJhtSCt0sHwCmvQh5lpSMcyL1&quot;
}

引入插件后，需要配置tinifyId,因为这里使用的是https://tinify.cn/ 进行压缩的图片，需要到这个网站申请一个开发者id，仅需要俩步就可以轻松申请

使用库
检测so适配
命令行执行命令 ./gradlew checkso

./gradlew checkso

从原始的Android开始，系统就支持设置两种方式的壁纸，一种是静态壁纸，另一种是动态壁纸。
静态壁纸
静态壁纸没什么好说的，通过系统提供的API一行代码就完事了。
最简单代码如下所示。
val wallpaperManager &#x3D; WallpaperManager.getInstance(this)
try {
    val bitmap &#x3D; ContextCompat.getDrawable(this, R.drawable.ic_launcher_background)?.toBitmap()
    wallpaperManager.setBitmap(bitmap)
} catch (e: Exception) {
    e.printStackTrace()
}

除了setBitmap之外，系统还提供了setResource、setStream，一共三种方式来设置静态壁纸。
三种方式殊途同归，都是设置一个Bitmap给系统API。
动态壁纸
动态壁纸就有点意思了，很多手机ROM也内置了一些动态壁纸，别以为这些是什么新功能，从Android 1.5开始，就已经支持这种方式了。只不过做的人比较少，为啥呢，主要是没有什么特别合适的场景，而且动态壁纸，会比静态壁纸更加耗电，所以大部分时候，我们都没用这种方式。
壁纸作为一个系统服务，在系统启动时，不管是动态壁纸还是静态壁纸，都会以一个Service的形式运行在后台——WallpaperService，它的Window类型为TYPE_WALLPAPER，WallpaperService提供了一个SurfaceHolder来暴露给外…</span>

背景
读博士的这些年，我每天都在获取各式各样的知识。大到学术论文，小到快捷指令的配置教程，每份知识都可能在未来某个时刻派上用场。我根据自己的习惯和需求建立了一套工作流，用来记录以及内化各类知识。我的目标是形成自己的个人数据库，方便未来随时的调用。
知识有不同的特点，调用场景也各不相同。下面的表格展示了我对知识的理解以及相应的分类。在这篇文章里，我将针对每个类型，介绍了我记录（和内化）这些知识的经验，以及使用到的工具。


知识类型知识特点例子
学术研究格式固定，密度高，需要原文阅读学术论文，演讲
系统性知识内容多，密度低，自上而下结构大学课程，教科书，出版书籍
非系统性知识碎片化知识，自下而上结构CSDN，网络文章，教学/科普 视频
信息只需记录，不需整理做饭教学视频，服务器配置流程代码


1. 学术研究
首先要讨论的是学术研究类的知识，代表的例子就是学术论文。可能是因为阅读论文都需要花费巨大的精力而且经常会查阅，我通常会对阅读过论文有印象。即便不一定记得所有的细节，我还是很容易就能检索到，并重新阅读。
学术论文这一类知识有三个特点：

知识密度高：文章内容很浓缩，比较难再二次总结。未来通常需要再查阅论文的时候大概率还是得阅读原文。
格式固定：学术论文通常都会有 Abstract 来记录文章梗概。理工科的论文经常会有 Related Work, Methodology 和 Results 这些章节。第一次阅读难度较大，但理解以后再次阅读的难度不大，信息获取容易。
上下文重要：随意从论文中抽出来某一段文字或者配图，不一定很好理解。通常需要结合上下文才好理解。

由于查阅论文的大多需要阅读原文，所以我不会专门用笔记 app 给论文记笔记。我会把笔记直接记在论文 PDF 上。

Lately, I’ve been looking at how Groovy streamlines the slight clunkiness of Java. In this article, I begin a short series to demonstrate Groovy scripting by creating a tool to analyze my music directory.
In this article, I demonstrate how the groovy.File class extends and streamlines java.File and simplifies its use. This provides a framework for looking at the contents of a music folder to ensure that expected content (for example, a cover.jpg file) is in place. I use the JAudiotagger library to analyze the tags of any music files.

Groovy is based on Java and requires a Java installation. Both a recent and decent version of Java and Gr…</span>

When people ask me what I love most about open source, my answer is simple: It&#x27;s the openness. With open source, the work that community developers and contributors do is in the public domain for all to see and benefit from. I couldn&#x27;t love that philosophy more.
How many people can say that about the fruits of their labor? How many, perhaps 50 years from now, can look back and say, &quot;Check out the code I wrote that day that hundreds/thousands/tens of thousands benefited from.&quot; I find that infinitely more exciting than working on software that&#x27;s hidden from most of the world.
I&#x27;m fortunate that my job puts me in the middle of an interesting area where open …</span>

                              <span>@PengyiWang. We are very excited to launch this on Product Hunt today.

🟢 What it is:
The Shopify Plus Calculator is a calculator that calculates the cost of moving your Shopify store to Shopify Plus. It’s primarily used by Shopify merchants who are already doing volume on their store, but are not sure if Plus makes sense for them yet.

🔵 Why we built it:
Working with ecommerce companies over the past years, we&#x27;ve experienced the power of Shopify Plus. The paltform powers some of the most beloved brands. Shopify adds a ton of innovation to it, which remains unaccessible for non Plus merchants. The cost of upgrading can be hard to figure out (SaaS fee + transaction fees + feature gains). It&#x27;s confusing for most merchants who are curious.

🟣 How it works:
1. Enter your store metrics: orders/month, AOV, current plan, transaction processor
2. Choose monthly or yearly billing
3. See the cost breakdown per plan
4. The conclusion shows the gross and net cost of upgrading to Shopify Plus

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。

最近，我正在研究使用 Obsidian，想看看大名鼎鼎的「卡片盒笔记法」是否真的能解决我读书过目就忘的困扰。不过困扰还不知道能不能解决，我就发现了新的问题。
Obsidian 有许多优点，其中一个就是自带社区主题库，用户可以随意更换样式，不再天天看千篇一律的外观。然而，尽管社区主题库里有很多主题样式，说实话，没有一个能百分之百令我满意的。
比如「Things」这个主题，我很喜欢它的简洁风格，但是它每一级的标题颜色却似乎并不遵循某种规律，甚至莫名其妙地在二级标题下多出了一条下划线，这一点让完美主义的我无比介意。

我明白，主题风格毕竟只是制作者的个人喜好，肯定是做不到让所有使用者都百分之百满意的。那么，有没有什么办法，可以让我自己来自定义主题呢？
答案是有的，Obsidian 设置中的「CSS 代码片段」这个功能就是为用户对外观进行自定义而准备的。

HTML 与 CSS
Obsidian 的外观本质上是由 CSS 代码所决定的。
我们可以打开 Obsidian 的窗口，按下 Ctrl + Shift + I，即可开启开发者工具（Developer Tools），这个操作和在浏览器中开启开发者工具是一样的，展示出来的也同样是 HTML 文档。

HTML，全称「HyperText Markup Language」，又称为「超文本标记语言」，它的作用就是告诉浏览器这个网页该怎么渲染，比如这段文字是一级标题，这一段文字是正文，而这一段文字是链接，可以跳转别的网页。
听起来和 Obsidian 所使用的 Markdown 很像。没错，M…</span>

相信许多普通用户都在用着M-ATX规格的主板，这也是颇具性价比的装机方案之一，毕竟追求极致性能也是需要口袋中有充足的氪金。但很有意思的是，虽然我们用着M-ATX规格主板，但机箱却多为ATX塔式。就如同我一样，给自己整了一个大机箱，装着一块M-ATX主板，美其名曰多出的空间散热更好。但说实话，机箱的散热效率还是要看风道设计，并不是箱子越大越好。

目前市面上M-ATX规格机箱并没有太多的新意，不是全侧透就是双侧透，有些外观甚至只差一个厂家LOGO，可选的机箱造型并不多，说是属于“缩小版”的ATX塔式机箱也不为过。对于我这种想减少光渲染又不想完全损失光影的玩家来说，确实很难抉择。

不过幸好最近华硕新推出了一款M-ATX规格机箱--华硕ASUS PRIME AP201冰立方机箱。初看商品介绍页面并没太大感觉，但翻了几篇买家秀后，发现设计感贼给力。接下来就聊聊我的换机体验，希望给各位小伙伴带来一些参考。

来自PRIME大师系列

当我将机箱换成华硕ASUS PRIME AP201冰立方机箱（以下简称华硕AP201冰立方机箱）并开机后，原先十分耀眼的光污染瞬间变得柔和起来。

关掉室内灯光后，整个华硕AP201冰立方机箱的光效就如同穿上了一套薄纱，内部的硬件会随着RGB灯效若隐若现，附加了一种神秘，确实有一种立方体的既视感。

从正上方看去，水冷风扇光影透过散热孔散出，被分割成具有像素风的格纹，经过切割的光影既复古又有奇幻的感觉。

而在光线充足的环境中，光影又并不会透出多少，朦胧中充满了低调，颇具内涵。

实际上华硕AP201冰立方机箱的内部自成天地，光影被拉得很足，离光污染全开之间也只差一个机盖开启动作。

外观小巧，却“大”有来头

华硕AP201冰立方机箱的外包装比较低调简洁，产品的特色描述并不算多，注明了支持360mm水冷，338mm显卡和ATX电源。

很高兴遇见你~
在本系列的上一篇文章中，我们介绍了 Flutter 特点以及一些常用的 Widget：MaterialApp，Scaffold，AppBar，Center，Container，Text。还没有看过上一篇文章的朋友，建议先去阅读 Flutter 系列（三）：Flutter 特点及常用 Widget 介绍。接下来我们继续对 Flutter Widget 进行学习
下面我会通过：效果展示 -&gt; Widget 讲解 -&gt; 代码实现的方式对 Widget 进行介绍，最后在通过 Widget 组合编写一个综合的案例
一、Flutter Widget 之 Image
Image 是 Flutter 给我们提供显示图片的 Widget
先看一眼使用 Image 实现的效果
1.1、Image 效果展示

刘亦菲的圆形图片😄，美爆了。言归正传，大家可以先想一下怎么去实现？
1.2、Image 介绍
Image 组件有很多构造方法，这里给大家讲两个常用的：
1、Image.network ：加载远程图片
2、Image.asset ：加载本地图片
上面这两个属于 Image 的命名构造方法，对命名构造方法还不熟悉的赶紧先去看一下我的另一篇文章传送门
1.2.1、Image.network 加载远程图片
import &#x27;package:flutter/material.dart&#x27;;

void main() {

    home: Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(

根据需求描述需要对顶部透出背景做主题切换效果。当频道页面做左右滑动操作时，页面背景也会随之发生变化。原有的框架结构如下所示：
/// 伪代码形式
NestedScrollView（
  headerSliverBuilder:（
    SliverAppBar（
      flexibleSpace:MagicFlexibleSpaceBar()
      bottom: TabBar()
    ）
  ）
  body:TabBarView（
    CustomScrollView（
      CupertinoSliverRefreshControl()
      SliverFixedExtentList()
    ）
    ///同上CustomScrollView
    ....
  ）
）

如果需要添加背景色覆盖住全局就必须将NestedScrollView嵌套在布局内部。可采用Stack形式讲主题背景作为底层布局在整体页面下方呈现出来，此外只需要为BackgroundThemes组件提供页面滑动监听即可实现主题背景切换的效果。
/// 伪代码形式

起因于自己想研究一下 game-engine，但是主流的 ue 什么的太过庞大了（庞大也是必然），于是想到了比较亲切的 Flutter Engine（其实也蛮复杂的），于是想梳理一下其 启动 和 绘制 的大概流程。
开始
注意， Flutter Engine 也相当庞大，由于精力有限，只能梳理部分内容。
Flutter Engine - Github
在开始之前，列举一下相关的代码文件夹
fml （基础功能的封装，比如基于task 的线程，log，时钟，路径，哈希等 很底层很硬核的东西）
shell/common （直接引用 shell.h 注释的一句话：Perhaps the single most important class in the Flutter engine repository.）
shell/runtime （不同平台对 embedder engine 具体实现）
impeller （图形后端，也就是roadmap 提到的在重构东西，你会发现它的 commit 时间最近，还带了好多个⚠️）
启动
Flutter 有几个线程？ 首先排除单线程，再排除经常看到的 5 线程模型（其实没啥问题）。 为什么皮这一下，因为实际情况可能比你想象的复杂的多，举两个例子：你在 Dart 开了一个 Compute Isolate，并且愉快的使用 fronted-server 提供的 hot-reload，这下情况就复杂了吧。
言归正传，我们从官方的 examples/vulkan_glfw 例子进行分析（我接触的时候当时只有一个 glfw-opengl 的例子，令人感概）
如何启动 Fluuter Engine ？

Compose中我们应该怎么使用地图呢？像之前我们在xml里面创建MapView，都是在Activity里面，管理MapView生命周期，和其他的监听器，Compose里面怎么搞？
下面我们以高德地图为例，在Compose中创建地图MapView，然后用AndroidView添加MapView，像下面这样：
AndroidView(modifier &#x3D; Modifier, factory &#x3D; { MapView }){...}

我们看到，高德地图官网，给开发者的建议：

所以我们需要做什么，大家晓得了哇，生命周期回调我们要拿到，那我们应该怎么搞？
我们需要用到LocalLifecycleOwner.current.lifecycle去添加生命周期观察者，
LifecycleObserver是一个接口，它长下面这样：

我们看注释可以看到，我们可以使用DefaultLifecycleObserver或者LifecycleEventObserver，
DefaultLifecycleObserver里面它提供了所有的生命周期事件的回调，并且默认情况下都是什么都不做。
LifecycleEventObserver，它提供了一个onStateChanged方法，所有的生命周期事件都可以在这里被接受到。
所以，我们这里就使用LifecycleEventObserver，为啥懂的都懂。
我们有了2个需要初始化的东西，一个是MapView，一个是添加生命周期观察者。
为什么要添加生命周期观察者，看了上面的官方文档应该知道是为什么，是需要管理地图的生命周期，下面我们来讲讲如何做，该怎么做。
初始化MapView并添加到AndroidView里面：

前言
最近这段时间,在看Flutter绘制的相关知识。主要是看张风捷特烈的绘制小册。通过对小册的学习了解Flutter绘制的相关知识，见识到了绚丽多姿的Flutter绘制世界。
话不多说，让我们开始今天的绘制之旅吧。
一，初始版本自定义控件效果图:

我把上述的控件命名为同心边框图形，顾名思义，该控件是由多个半径不同的圆形边框组成的自定义控件，且这些边框拥有相同的中心点。
二，控件需求拆解：
经过拆解分析,该控件的功能可以分为以下几点:
1,不同圆形的半径是等差递增的,即两两相邻的圆形间隔是相等的。
2,支持业务侧传入参数,来确定图形的颜色。
3,底部的两个Slider用来控制自定义控件的中心点。
4,支持每秒切换圆形边框的颜色。
2.1 同心圆的绘制
我们先完成中间多个同心圆的绘制，
很明显对于自定义控件我们要自定义CustomPainter,从而拿到Canvas进行绘制。对于同心圆来说，需要三个参数，即最小圆半径，最大圆半径和颜色数组。其中颜色数组还用来确定同心圆的数量
class ConcentricPainter extends CustomPainter {
  ConcentricPainter({this.minRadius &#x3D; 10, this.maxRadius &#x3D; 20, 
  this.colorsList &#x3D; const [Colors.amber, Colors.cyan]});

  final double minRadius;

  final double maxRadius;

  List colorsList &#x3D; [Colors.amber, Colors.cyan];

  final Paint mPaint &#x3D; Paint()

之前的文章对build.dart 如何生成的做了一个简单分析，现在build.yaml配置参数已经通过build.dart 引入到build体系中了，接下来就该根据参数执行builder了；
在第一篇文章中简单概括了build.dart 的执行流程，最终是由build.dart 会执行BuildRunner去执行所有builder并返回结果；那么现在就该看下BuildRunner到底做了什么；
BuildRunner

BuilderOption
首先是配置参数部分，在这里首先构建了BuilderOption，其所需的参数中除了一些bool开关之类的简单配置外，就只有三个部分：packageGraph、overidBuildConfig、resolvers；
其中packageGraph在前面文章中经常见了，根据pubspec.yaml而生成的依赖有向图；
overidBuildConfig也是打过招呼的部分，是根据build.yaml生成的BuildConfigMap；
resolvers这个还没介绍过，看注释，其作用是生成BuildStep，在这里先跳过，这个BuildStep里面又搞出好几个新东西，后面一起看；

BuilderOption 的创建是通过其create方法，其方法中会先创建TargetGraph，之后给resolver分配个兜底值（AnalyzerResolvers），最后组合起来；
而这个TargetGraph跟PackageGraph的区别是，PackageGraph 是根据pubspec.yaml生成的；而TargetGraph是在PackageGraph基础上，使用overridBuildConfig覆盖之后生成的；这也…</span>

Notion、Obsidian、Logseq、Roam Research、Evernote、flomo、为知、飞书、语雀……知识管理/笔记软件越来越多，我总在不同应用间徘徊。直到有次忽然醒悟，知识管理软件不是管理知识，而是管理笔记。笔记里的知识并不属于你，只有经过消化、应用，才会成为自己的知识。
这么简单的事，我之前却一直没看透，总是把笔记与知识理解划上了等号。当要用到曾摘录的笔记时，就在各类知识管理软件里翻找，折腾一番才找到需要的笔记，有时甚至出现「自己不清楚放在哪里，也不清楚是否有」的情况。记笔记花了一个小时，下次寻找与重新消化又花了一个小时，原本为效率而生的知识管理软件变成了浪费时间的杀手。
另一方面，我们在用知识管理软件的美观界面和强大功能的同时，也被这些软件所限制，无法完全按自己的想法输出笔记。比如，你长了一双翅膀，Markdown 文本是自由的天地，而进入 Notion 则被隔成一个个小房间，你在房间里待着很舒服，可一旦想去其他房间，就必须脱离 block，不比 Markdown 可以自由飞翔。

突破迷思后，我基于 VuePress 和 vuepress-theme-hope 建立了 LearnData 项目，把知识笔记、生活记录、博客和任何觉得有价值的记录转成 Markdown 文本，然后推送到 GitHub 生成 Pages 静态页面，同步到国内云服务器形成 LearnData - 开源学习笔记。

LearnData 的笔记/文章编辑均使用 Markdown，输出不再受到应用的局限。同时，LearnData …</span>

                              <span>前言
2022年是新能源车国补的收尾年，随着销量提升，纯电新能源车品牌不断增多，可选性逐渐增大，价格也不断攀升。 

新能源车最完美的使用环境就是有家用充电桩的日常通勤，享受每公里0.05元以下的电费成本，每天到家就能补足电量，即不产生里程焦虑，也极大程度降低出行成本。
早年新能源车标配充电桩，如今随着价格的提高，充电桩成为了重点阉割项目，不说早早就卖8000的特斯拉，今年的小鹏、问界、沃尔沃都不再赠送充电桩，未来越来越多的厂商会加入这一行列。
7KW充电桩或成为未来主流
虽然我个人认为家用申请380V电表，安装21KW充电桩是拓展性最好的极优解，但目前随着环境的改变，未来大部分国人的家充桩都会是220V 7KW的家用桩。 

首先是电网的审批层面，上海地区的国家电网已经于今年停止了380V充电桩电表的新装报批，目前国网只为新能源车主开放220V电表，最大功率7KW的申请渠道。
这是因新能源车增多而出现的必然趋势，国内未来势必会逐渐取消380V电表用于充电。 

第二是对于交流充电而言，家用充电桩是带有保护装置的连接件，充电过程发生于车载充电机，最快交流充电速度由充电机决定，目前国内在售交流充电速率最高的是16KW，搭载在Model S与Model X两台百万级豪车上，一般大众款新能源车，没有这样的高功率电机。 

理想、威马、蔚来、比亚迪、埃安、荣威等主流的新能源车品牌的核心车型，基本都是内置7KW充电机，不支持11KW三相电来交流充电，所以对于很多车主，7KW充电桩已经是顶配了。
最后是7KW交流充电的表现，以谷时点8小时计算，可以为车辆补充56度电，目前市面大部分家用中小型纯电新能源车的能耗在每度电6~7公里，折算一夜谷时可以补电300~350公里，完全可以狠狠开上一整天。
所以，因为政策、热销车辆和7KW充电桩家充综合体验来看，220V 7KW的家充桩或将是未来家庭…</span>

作为一个法学生，我的日常生活主要围绕在上课、论文、实习以及我杂七杂八的爱好上。今天在这里跟大家聊一聊我是如果进行任务管理的。
我的任务管理系统
软件的选择
从2017年接触滴答清单以来，滴答清单变得功能越来越丰富。熟悉这款软件的人都知道，如今的滴答清单已经不单单是一款Todo  List软件了，而是一款融合日历、笔记、清单、习惯打卡、番茄钟的“综合性”软件。
我相信大多数的“少数派”们都是“Less is more”的坚实簇拥者，看到现在的滴答清单一定也会和我一样不自觉的想起国产的印象笔记，觉得这是一款什么都做却又什么都做不好的软件。因此从2017年接触这款软件后，我很快又转向了Things、Omnifocus、Todoist、Anydo、2Do、微软Todo、Reminder……
不夸张的说，从2016年接触GTD概念后的我，基本用过市面上各式各样的GTD软件，但是时隔多年，2016年的我刚刚进入大学，如今的我研究生也已经快要毕业了，在经历过不同环境下各种工作流的转换，兜兜转转我还是回到了滴答清单，原因无他，唯性价比高、满足我的需求、稳定矣。
化繁为简
虽然现在的滴答清单功能复杂，但好在这款软件还是给我们“Less is more”的选择，即仅选择我们用得到的功能，隐藏那些我们用不到的功能
滴答清单的功能模块隐藏
就我个人而言，我把滴答清单仅作为我的Todo List和日历，因此也就只选择了这两个功能模块。除了能够隐藏部分“功能”，在滴答清单里，还能够做到隐藏“视图”、“标签”等，将“Less is more”的观点贯彻到底，对于显示什么，不显示什么给了我们非常大的自主权。

下面我就来讲讲我具体是怎样使用滴答清单来处理我的日常生活的。

                              <span>越来越受欢迎的白板工具
最近几年市面上出现了很多白板工具应用，白板顾名思义就是在手机、平板、或者电脑上模拟现实生活中白板的应用。
白板应用从产品设计的角度来讲及其简单，因为白板应用的的概念模型足够简单——就是一张白纸、或者办公室放着的一块白板。
如果仅从概念模型上来看，白板应用似乎没啥可做的，你只需要写一个白板，然后做一个手写功能就可以了。
那么为什么市面上还是有那么多的白板应用呢？以及决定一款白板应用好不好用，我们是不是有什么样的评价标准呢？
对于这个问题，我想说的是，在保证使用体验的前提下，工具产品本身是没有好坏之分的，评判一款工具产品好不好其实没有意义，工具产品只能基于你的使用场景，评判适不适合。所以基于这个逻辑，我使用一个框架对市面上的白板应用进行了一个简单的分类。

 
在纵向，我根据使用场景来进行划分，就是你使用白板更多的时候是个人使用，还是需要和别人协作？
在横坐标上，我使用白板本身的功能性来进行划分，目前市面上的白板应用在功能性层面主要分为两类，第一类主打真实书写体验，无限书写区域，完全书写自由度，第二类则主打提供模块化的组件，弱化书写体验，强化沟通模版的白板应用。
从这种分类方式可以发现，其实个人的更偏向于自由度高的，而协作的更偏向于模块化的，为什么呢？
因为这和实际的工作场景是匹配的，个人使用白板，无论怎么发散书写，书写的信息的上下文都在个人脑中。但如果是协作场景的话，沟通的效率就变得至关重要，所以一些通用的，模块化的，标准化的沟通方法可以让所有对一个事情的认知都对齐，这种方法本质上是弱化了个人化的表达方式，用更标准的沟通方式来提升沟通效率。
也许以上分类方法并不是一定合理，但就目前我自己用起来是OK的。
在聊具体的白板应用之前我想，先聊一个问题。
为什么白板这么好用？

                              <span>上周三微信派发布了《2012.8.17，微信公众平台上线了》，引发了一群公号自媒体人的集体怀旧。是啊，已经十年了。
你或多或少还能想起一些公号大V，还有以前在朋友圈刷屏的文章，那些高光时刻像浮雕一样刻在脑海，好像见证着这个平台的兴衰浮沉。
今天不考古，也不讲宏大叙事，想从个人的视角，跟你分享下我与公众号的一些故事。

我第一次知道公众号是2013年，那是大一下学期，我也刚注册微信。
彼时微博正兴，因在校园杂志上看到「糗事大百科」博主赵诚玩微博年入千万，颠覆认知，第一次看到上学-工作之外的道路。
我能不能呢？不知道，但想试试。
寒假买了第一台笔记本电脑，从此没日没夜沉浸在微博里，研究怎么涨粉、互推、发段子。
做搞笑内容半年时间，小有成就，到了5万多粉丝（没买粉），偶有广告投放赚点零花钱，我对微博的发展充满信心。
注册微信后了解到公众号，那会儿我对它是不屑一顾的，长内容、排版难看、一天就发一条、没互动，怎么看都没出路。而微博不一样，信息流、用户停留时间长、话题多、互动丰富、140字段子&amp;新闻、搞笑动图，人们更喜欢，这才是媒介发展的下一个方向。
公众号就像上个时代的博客，现在无非迁移到移动端，换汤不换药。
谁愿意拿着手机看长文呢？
2014年，我给学校一家饰品玩具店出营销主意，老板问我要不要做公众号，我坚决说不要做，耽误精力、不能实时传达，还得引导关注，太麻烦，不如加微信好友送小礼品，然后朋友圈发优惠活动。人们不看公众号，但肯定刷朋友圈，触达率更高（没想到那会儿就有私域流量的理念了）。
转变是在大二下学期，微博起色不大，发送频率高又耽误学习，而且一直发搞笑段子觉得没意义，就把号卖了。
于此同时，公众号很多优质内容开始出现，好多大V也倾向长文、深度观点输出，即便是搞笑段子，质量也比微博高一个层次。自己开始沉迷每日阅读公号，朋友圈也经常有刷屏文章，同学讨论的也是XX文章的观点，仿佛突…</span>

                              <span>「第二份简历」
首先解释一下这个「第二份」是什么意思。我通常喜欢把在大四校招时使用的简历称作「第一份简历」，因为那是你踏入社会的第一步，是你第一次将自己的经历通过简历来展示。往后跳槽、换工作使用的简历都可以称作「第二份」，它代表着你已经是一个成熟的社会人，有足够的社会、工作经验。
那么就让我们先回看一下「第一份简历」我们都会写一些什么。我们在写校招简历的时候，通常会涉及到的内容为以下几点。

专业课分数 / 绩点
奖惩情况
兼职情况
在校期间参与的项目（可以是学校的实验，也可以是兼职参与的项目）
在校期间所任职务

这五点足够展现你在大学四年的能力，让校招企业充分了解你。因为能够参与校招的企业，都知道你不会有正式的工作经历，自然也没参与过社会上的工作项目。企业人事对参与校招的学生大多抱着「该生是否有培养空间」的态度来面对。因此在写校招简历的时候上面五点只需要充分体现你的潜力就足以吸引到大部分校招企业。
来到「第二份简历」，这个时候你面对的 HR ，不再会把你当作初出茅庐的应届毕业生，而是一个有着社会工作经验的求职者。HR 对求职者的要求也非常简单明了，即「你是否能为公司创造价值」。这个「价值」可以是短期内的，也可以是长远角度的，具体看 HR 怎么定位你的职位。但是有一点是不变的，那就是上面提到的，你不再是学生，你只是「求职者」。
如何写「第二份简历」
「第二份简历」相比「第一份简历」，会有不少内容上的变化。首先是不再着重于在校情况的描写，而是着墨于当前或者上段工作经历的一个梳理与细致归纳。不要简单概括，而是要将内容详细写出来。同时，在现公司或者前公司所做的项目，也要有个清晰的描写。

                              <span>最近我们发布了一款全新的笔记产品——Neatfiy。（https://neatifyapp.com/）
正如其名，Neat（整洁）ify（化），Neatify 的初衷是编辑整洁清晰的结构化笔记，比起很快速的随手记备忘录，它适用于知识的管理、周期性的写作总结...之类的场景。
如左图
在大约去年年底的时候，我们立下了一个 Flag——我们要将专注笔记进行一次重构。 Neatify 就是我们拿出来的结果。下面不简单地聊一下，我们在这个路上的一些思考，以及集中回答一些朋友提出的疑问：

很多人对于 Neatify 的第一个疑问，就是为什么我们团队要出两款很相似的两款产品？

专注笔记，是我们第一款推出的笔记软件。也是我们团队首次接触「笔记」软件的开始，虽然我们自己也很喜欢专注笔记，它有很多很有用的功能及体验，比如结构化的目录、清晰的标注阅读体验。
但确实我们是第一次做笔记软件，前期很多没想清楚的地方，因此做了很多没什么用、甚至很负面的一些设计。这些是一些很沉重的历史包袱。如果我们还背着沉重的历史包袱，我们在优化的过程中就显得被束缚住了。
很显然的是，我们在这三年多的积累里，最重要的不是我们写过了什么代码，而是积累了很多很多的经验。所以我们这次，希望是抛开一切已有的东西，去构思一款自己心目中最理想的笔记产品应该是怎样的。这就是 Neatify。
在 Neatfiy 上面，我们并没有很刻意地去增加很多的功能，来让它看上去有很明显被“改版升级”的感觉，甚至做了很多的减法，比如：
1、把笔记本、子页面等层级都砍了，只保留文件夹 → 页面这样的结构，因为在使用专注笔记的时候，我们总在纠结，这样的层级关系，我们应该使用笔记本呢？还是子页面呢？还是文件夹呢？它们之间的作用太相似了，在每次使用的时候都要思考很久，这是意见很“反效率”的事情。
2、把很多花里胡哨的功能去了，比如各种各样的视图啊之类…</span>

                              <span>上一讲“猛药”过去，功效性的讲解就要小小告一段落了。在护肤金字塔的第二层，只剩下了“修护”这个话题，而在金字塔的顶端，“再生”我们还有没有提到。修护与再生，代表了皮肤自身的规律，修护受损的细胞，代谢老去的废物，同时刺激新的牺牲生成。修护和再生在一门交叉学科，很难把他们分开。那么就从这里开始，让我们看看修护和再生的秘诀。
什么是修护与再生
我们的皮肤，每天都冲在第一线，帮助我们抵御外界的侵袭，所以皮肤每天都在“受伤”，修护，就是要让我们的皮肤屏障更坚挺，保证皮肤能够处于正常的工作状态。
但修护并不等同于“包扎伤口”，不是只有当皮肤已经明显受损以后才需要修护，而更像是增强免疫力，需要从日常下手，维护皮肤的健康状态。所以，修护既是我们大妈们锻炼身体的广场舞，也是医生关键时刻可以救命的手术刀。
而再生，依赖于修护，又高于修护。修护的目的就是让皮肤获得健康稳定的状态，从而促使其再生，再生依赖于修护提供好的基础，同时又在修护的基础上提供和创造新生。
修护与再生的场景
不同的情况下，我们所选择的修护方法、成分、产品也不尽相同。
日常修护
大多数时候，我们需要的都只是日常的修护，目的是让白天工作了一天的皮肤得到舒缓和放松，类似于我们每晚的睡眠，是为了让皮肤可以继续保持一个健康稳定的状态。这种情况下，并不需要使用什么猛药，只需要选择皮肤容易吸收的，温和的产品，就可以达到我们的要求。这时修护的关键词是：温和。
晒后紧急修护
紫外线对皮肤的伤害，在防晒的一讲中已经充分解读（忘记了，可以回看这里），但有时候我们难免遇到极端天气，或者一时犯懒，防晒做的不好，导致皮肤被晒伤。这时皮肤往往处于一个非常脆弱的状态，继续急速有效的镇定，来帮助皮肤迅速回到相对稳定的状态。这时修护的关键词是：极速。
过敏修护
对于敏感肌同学，经常需要面对的就是解决自己的过敏问题，当皮肤受到一些并不耐受的刺激，就会激发皮肤的自我…</span>

                              <span>前言
理性聊车，高尔夫也很好，特斯拉也很棒，奔驰宝马大家都喜欢，在此分享一下购车的一些想法和感受，祝大家都拥有自己的爱车。
我自认从工作以来和车的缘分还是非常深的，从 4S 销售到广告策划，又因为接触大众、斯柯达更多，再到家里换了奥迪后，与其说是喜欢，不如说是对这种德系品牌的习惯。结合到家里本身有车，我的车就不需要承担「家庭重任」，可以随我喜欢。但提车后的这一个多月，这台小车让我开始强烈的感受到「家的责任」。
提车日
购车在上海上半年疫情解封之后，去到奥迪4S店，看到店里积压了较多库存，当时我自己也没有特别倾向的颜色，A3的颜色除了红色我都挺喜欢，就在库存的冰川白、探戈红、环焦蓝、纳瓦拉蓝中，选择了较深的纳瓦拉蓝，张扬的造型配一个低调内敛的颜色。中配（时尚运动）的车型上，库存车上额外增加了四门无钥匙进入（+¥2000），加上购置税减半政策，实际落地20万不到。

奢侈与吝啬的交织
20万买 A0 小车，奢侈
最开始的选车首先当然是预算，20万以内，另外优先紧凑级，SUV 或 Sedan 我并不是特别在意，但两厢车型是我比较青睐的。第八代高尔夫和 A3 Sportsback 是最后的二选一，同样的预算高尔夫可以买到顶配 R-Line 版本，拥有更多的科技配置。而 A3 在20万内，只能说配置相对实用一些，没有氛围灯、副驾驶电动座椅等等这些。
网上说的最多的，就是 A3 不过是换壳高尔夫，还要加钱。说对也对，但在做工和实际的细微体验上，还是会有所差异。其实最后更促成下单的，是展厅销售的态度，毕业那年我自己也做过汽车销售，了解一些展厅里的道道。你如果问我，是不是有虚荣心的成本，那我的答案是肯定的。

不加2万上顶配，吝啬
从升级配置来看，时尚运动与豪华运动之间，相差近2万，增加了：

30色内饰氛围灯
电动折叠后视镜，带副驾驶侧下翻
副驾驶电动座椅与多向调节
三温区空调
主驾驶1…</span>

九月将至，大一新生踏入校园的同时，大四「老油条」们也开始准备自己的毕业论文与实习工作。学年论文与毕业论文时本科生绕不过的一座大山，以下是我在大四撰写论文时积累的一些个人经验与见解，希望对学弟、学妹们的论文写作有所帮助。
电子资源
文科专业的大部分学生在本科阶段，了解学界研究会借助知网、万方数据等文献数据库。国内高校图书馆也会购买文献数据库的使用权限，方便校内教职工与学生使用。在校园网中打开图书馆的网站，找到电子资源栏目，便可以看到学校已购买的电子数据库。除了学校提供的电子资源，不少地方图书馆对当地公众与读者提供电子资源，如国家图书馆、浙江图书馆在注册后便可免费使用。

扩展阅读：《免费看论文？除了学校的图书馆，还有 ……》

当我们搜索某个领域的文献，数据库会返回不少的文章，文章的质量良莠不齐，参考文献的作用时帮助你了解研究话题的学术现状、存在问题、解决方法等，导师进行论文指导也会强调尽量挑选时间较新的「核心期刊」与「原始文献」，注重文献的权威性、专业性与时效性。在数据库搜索时，我们可以通过筛选功能，选择来自「核心期刊」的文献，如北大核心、南大核心、SCI、EI、SSCI 等期刊目录。
期刊筛选
大部分阅读与参考的文献我是从万方数据下载的，PDF 文档方便在不同的软件中阅读与文献管理，二是万方提供的 PDF 文档默认自带目录与文字图层，知网（大陆版）默认只提供 CAJ 格式的文档，缺德到家。
Word 主题样式
不少大学生在「制造学术垃圾」使用的主流写作工具是 Microsoft Word，最头疼的除了正文写作，还有学术论文的格式规范。一篇学术论文的结构大致可分为以下四大部分：封面、目录、正文以及引用。
论文结构
以我大学的《毕业论文档案打印和格式要求》为例，除去页面设置、撰写规范、字词符号用法等要求，大部分内容的格式涉及到 Word 中的字…</span>

                              <span>为了给新人创作者提供制作播客的参考，此前播客志对录音场地、录音设备、后期工具、AU使用教程进行了大规模征集及分享，邀请故事FM、日谈公园、深夜谈谈等播客机构，Steve、重轻、艾文和金花等资深创作者进行分享。
本次推送延续此前的逻辑，在有了场地、设备等硬件设施后，分享一档节目如何诞生。也可以说是内容创作的SOP（标准流程），邀请声东击西、日谈公园、津津乐道、深夜谈谈、番薯剥壳工作室，讲述专业播客机构的内容生产流程，如何保证节目质量始终保持一定水准？如何协调不同工种间的工作？一期节目上线前要经历什么？
每期精品内容的产出都是在推动播客朝着行业化的方向发展，感谢各大机构工作人员的热情参与！

审核和内容收集
(虽然是具体情况具体分析，但是对于部分节目可以固定下来)
 
1、资料完善度
主持人需要详细的提纲，这对后面流程完善起到重要作用
主持人需要提交的是:嘉宾资料(姓名正确书写、头衔、照片、希望给到的社交媒体账号)+**建议标题**+采访内容&amp;提纲+音频收集+建议删除内容
 
2、素材给到时间(1.5 小时，2 人对话)
负责人:主播+监制
素材一般提前7天，至少不晚于3/4日给到
 
3 播客完成版提交审核的时间
负责人:后期
后期的制作的重点永远是:时间节点，如果只给到2天时间制作，请用好这两天时间，没必要永远优化细化无止境的美化下去。
理想的完成版审核日期，是上线前1日以上，如果无法在1日之前提交，请提前在群中说明原因
 
此外:剪辑之前请提前和节目负责人(主播/监制)确认:是否需要给嘉宾审核，考虑到嘉宾时差(如北美时间)、工作繁忙(大公司CEO)，可能需要跨自然日审核，所以最好上线前至少两天给到嘉宾粗剪版用来审核.
 
比如周二上线商业Y酱，周一需要提交音频审核，如果周一无法提交审核，需要周五说明情况
 
 
剪辑时需要注意的细节

软件的选择与流程的建立
在漫长的学习之路上，我遇到了学习软件，它们和我磨合、指导我的学习、被我不断的筛选。在这个过程中我逐渐有了一些想法来选择软件，并最终建立流程。
软件的主要特性-一切的基础
我也许从来都是一个缺少方法的人，直到软件进入我的生活，与其说它们是工具，不如说它们是我的一部分关于学习的性格。 我从不对软件硬性要求，要求它符合我的工作流程或是符合我的方法论，我对它们抱有了更大的期望，我对那些能做我以前做不到的事的软件抱有期望，因为它们的价值是难以衡量的。 于是我要求它有某种特性，可以与我使用的软件区别出来，完成我曾经难以完成的工作。
方法论-以实际的场景体现
软件的诞生一开始就会被打上开发者的烙印，就像是同样的教科书，不同的主编会有不同的侧重一样。如果一个软件有着鲜明的主要功能特色那它几乎一定体现着某种思想，但是方法论存在着问题，就是难以证伪，越是想用思想捏合成一座大厦最后会发现地基可能都是不牢的。那么如何使用方法论呢？
1. 与科学接轨，学习有关知识；对信息源可信度进行筛选
2. 在使用中验证方法论，最好有一定程度的量化
3. 简化抽象方法论，细化具体方法论不至于在臃肿中走向模糊
4. 重视全面和逻辑性 
扯远了，在软件的方法论验证中，重要的无疑是第二条。 如何验证呢，就是在它主张的场景使用它（或仅仅是想象使用），注意它的价值，这是我认为最好的方式，一个好的软件应该是向你描绘了一个出色高效的使用过程。 另一种方法是看受人欢迎的软件，某种意义上来说它的有效经过了人的验证，注意它的独特性即可。
软件的使用与功能的解构
当我们使用一款软件，很多情况下并不是按照作者给出的使用场景进行使用，但这不意味着这种使用是错误的，因为开发者不可能列出所有的使用场景，也与你的面对的场景不尽相同。了解软件的边界重点在于对其功能的理解。
