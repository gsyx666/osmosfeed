                              <span>What is openapi?


Openapi is a set of tools and standards for creating, managing, and securing APIs. It includes a specification for describing APIs, a runtime for executing APIs, and a set of tools for managing APIs. 
API supports, the parameters that each operation requires, the data types that are used by the API, and other information. I already wrote an article about it, you can check it before continue to read.
OpenAPI can be used to secure access to APIs by requiring authentication and authorization for all API calls.
API often suffer of authentication problem.

So how we can avoid this type of Vulnerability?
Using an Specification can help to have more structure about your permissions level.

                              <span>There is a reason why I don&#x27;t like classic OOP. The primary one being that it destroys my creativity and ability to express myself. As proof of that, realise I just invented HTTP based OOP, with inheritance and polymorphism, with the capability of &quot;overriding&quot; an existing HTTP endpoint, and inject additional logic in my &quot;HTTP interceptor&quot;, allowing me to &quot;extend&quot; the original HTTP invocation. This allows me to inject additional custom business logic in my original HTTP endpoint, without modifying it. And of course, it&#x27;s almost impossible to implement using classic OOP.
In the video below I am demonstrating how to implement Stripe payments into &quot;whatever&quot; HTTP API you have from before, using polymorphism, and &quot;overriding&quot; my original HTTP invocation. Basically, I am demonstrating HTTP based…</span>

After confirming the use cases and the API Designs, It will be cool if we (Frontend Developers) have a mock API ready so that we can start building our features, and then it will require 0 to minimal effort when connecting the backend once it is ready. So knowing the methods and tools to create mock APIs will help you build apps faster.
In order to create mock APIs, we need some ways to generate mock data. These data will help us a lot in the future as well apart from the initial development. Like **testing, component documentation, **etc. So to create mock APIs we can either use

This article will look at setting up the project and installing all the dependencies we need.
The basic Next.js set up is quite forward these days, so let&#x27;s run through it.
First, open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Next.js project.
npx create-next-app

Once done, it will install the project inside a folder whose name you picked in the CLI prompt.
Navigate to this folder (in my case, next-portfolio).
cd next-portfolio

If you are eager to see it work, run npm run dev to start up the server.
However, we will look into adding Tailwind CSS. First, Tailwind is an easy way to style the application neatly.

                              <span>When I find my post has url likes:
https://dev.to/peterlitszo/docker-network-4047

Of course it is readable. But what happen if the author change his/her username?
I try to rename me as peterlitszoxxx, and I try to access the same post. I find it redirect to my new username! Awesome!
There are a lot of website use user&#x27;s ID rather than username. I do not think it is a bad idea - Althorgh we loss the readable, but we will never change the user&#x27;s ID (just because it is not readable).
But when we use a readable thing in the website, what happen if we want to change it? For example, the article in other website may hold the origin url to the post and we cannot change it. If the user change his/her username, the url will be broken.
Redirect is a good idea. We can let a user has a lot of usernames, and limit the speed of change his/her username. But what happen if another user want to use the username nobody using?
Unreadable url looks not well, but it is not a bad idea. and urls in the web are broken easily always. Using unreadable things can make the url avoid being broken rather than using readable things as ID.</span>

                              <span>Recently, Josh Goldberg joined me on my stream to discuss TypeScript, TypeScript ESLint, open source, and Josh’s new book, Learning TypeScript.
It was a great conversation. At one point we discussed open source.




Here is the transcript.
Nick Taylor:
you&#x27;ve been working in open source for a while. I found it really interesting that you went from, what I can only assume was a great job. You were at a ed tech company, right?
It was, Was that it? The name&#x27;s escaping me.
Josh Goldberg: 
Yeah. Codecademy.
It was a great job. Highly recommend Codecademy as a, as a product and a place. Lovely people there.

 

Nick Taylor:
So you were having fun there. You were enjoying it. You were still contributing an open source, but, I&#x27;m curious. What the decision to go full or why did you decide to go kin…</span>

                              <span>Hello Readers! Welcome to the third devlog on this series where I code a multiplayer turn-based strategy game! If you haven&#x27;t read the three previous posts, go check them out! This week, I created a simple and exciting selecting system for my troops. Without further ado, let&#x27;s get into it. Hope you enjoy!
In the last devlog, I talk about how I implemented the spawning mechanism in my game. Essentially, placing some troops on the board. This went very well and is now fully functional. However, we still need to be able to select those troops and move them. This is what it looks like after this week:

Here the skeleton is not clearly distinguishable, so I&#x27;ll make sure to change some colors for next time.

The code for this was actually quite long, so I&#x27;ll simply sum it up for you. Essentially, we spawn on every board tile two entities, one for movement interactions and one for attack interactions. These both have their own separate components named MoveInteraction and AttackInteraction. They are always invisible, except when the SelectedCardEntity resource (which is an Option) contains an entity. When that happens, if they are close enough to that entity, we show them. Pretty simple, right? Well, this took around about 200 lines of code. However, I think the result is definitely worth it.

In conclusion, this was a very short devlog for this week, and it&#x27;s a bit late. Normally, I would post on Friday, but I think I&#x27;ll start doing it on the weekends. I may even only post every other week, since I don&#x27;t have enough progress to show for after a week. 
In addition, the code is now on Github for everyone to see! You can find it at here
Finally, I would like to say thank you if you read this post all the way. This was a short one. Also, since it&#x27;s currently Hacktober, I would really enjoy getting into open source contributions. If you have a project (ideally Rust) that needs  contributions, leave a link in the comments and I&#x27;ll check it out!</span>

                              <span>Hey everyone, I just released the Reduct Storage SDK for C++ v1.0.0. Now it supports Reduct Storage v1.0.0.
Because it is a major release, I refactored the Bucket.Write and Bucket.Read methods and made the more similar to Bucket.Query  See #41.
Now to read a record from the storage engine, we use a callback with a proxy object:
  auto client &#x3D; IClient::Build(&quot;https://play.reduct-storage.dev&quot;);
  // Create a bucket
  auto [bucket, create_err] &#x3D; client-&gt;GetOrCreateBucket(&quot;bucket&quot;);
  if (create_err) {
    std::cerr Read(&quot;entry-1&quot;, ts, [](auto rec) {
        std::cout ReadAll() Write(&quot;entry-1&quot;, ts, [](auto rec) {
    rec-&gt;WriteAll(&quot;some_data1&quot;); 
});

You also can easily use the same proxy objects to write or read records via chunks.
Have fun!</span>

                              <span>负载均衡就是将资源分配到某一时刻最需要它的地方。




当个人电脑刚开始发展的时候，一个家庭可能只有一台（或更少）的电脑。孩子们白天玩电脑游戏，家长们晚上在业务支撑系统上做会计、编程，或者漫游。然而，想象一下今天一个只有一台电脑的家庭，你可以预想到这样会产生什么样的冲突。每个人都想使用电脑，而只有一副键盘和鼠标。

随着计算机变得越来越普遍，IT 行业或多或少也出现了同样的情况。对服务和服务器的需求已经增长到了会因为用量过大而停机的程度。幸运的是，我们现在有了负载均衡的概念来帮助我们处理需求。

负载均衡是什么？

负载均衡是一个通用术语，指的是为了确保高效分配所管理的资源而做的事情。对于 Web 服务器的系统管理员来说，负载均衡通常意味着确保 Web 服务器软件（例如 Nginx）配置了足够的工作节点来处理激增的访客。换言之，如果一个网站突然变得非常受欢迎，其访问者在几分钟内增加了四倍，那么运行服务器的软件必须能够响应每个访问者，并不能让任何访问者发现服务质量下降。对于简单的网站，这就像修改一行配置选项一样简单，但对于具有动态内容的复杂站点，每个用户都有多个数据库查询，这可能是一个严重的问题。

这个问题本应随着云计算的发展而解决，但当 Web 应用程序遇到意外激增时，无法扩展也不是不可能。

在进行负载均衡时，需要记住的重要一点是，高效地分配资源并不一定意味着平均地分配资源。并非所有任务都在任何时候都需要所有的可用资源。一个智能的负载均衡策略仅在需要资源时才为用户和任务提供资源。这通常是应用程序开发人员的领域，而不是 IT 基础架构的责任。异步应用程序对于确保离开计算机休息的用户不占用服务器上的宝贵资源至关重要。

负载均衡是怎么工作的？

负载均衡通过在多个计算节点上分配工作负载来避免瓶颈。这些节点可能是数据中心中的物理服务器、云环境中的容器、用…</span>

                              <span>好消息：一个免费的 Ubuntu Pro 计划，每个人都可以获得 10 年的安全更新。




Canonical 为 Ubuntu Pro 引入了一个免费计价层，该层针对个人使用和小规模部署。

Ubuntu Pro 订阅（以前称为 “Ubuntu Advantage”）最初是为企业提供的，用于为他们额外提供 5 年的 Ubuntu LTS 版本的扩展安全维护更新。

该免费计价层已在公共测试版中提供。

对于个人与数据中心的 Ubuntu Pro




目前作为测试版提供，Ubuntu Pro 的免费计价层可供个人用户或小型数据中心使用，最多可容纳五台机器。

随着此次发布，Canonical 首席执行官 Mark Shuttleworth 表示：


自从我们首次推出 Ubuntu LTS 以来，并为这个主要的操作系统免费提供五年的安全保障，我们的企业客户要求我们在私人商业协议下覆盖越来越广泛的开源领域。今天，我们很高兴通过免费的个人 Ubuntu Pro 订阅免费向世界上的任何人提供！


与标准发行版相比，Ubuntu Pro 的主要优势在于不断提供安全补丁。



对于希望系统稳定而又不会丢失安全更新的用户来说，这是一个难以置信的好消息。

安全维护更新会定期推出，尤其是在发现新的 CVE（常见漏洞和暴露）时。

用户可以利用 Livepatch 来应用安全补丁，而无需关闭他们的系统。这包含在 Ubuntu Pro 订阅中。

小型企业和个人还可以使用合规管理所需的各种工具，支持 PCI-DSS、HIPAA、FedRAMP 等合规标准，并作为 Ubuntu Pro 订阅的一部分。

那么，个人和企业使用 Ubuntu 的更多激励措施？


💡 如果你最多有五台机器要用，Ubuntu Pro 的免费个人层应该是一个不折不扣正确的选择，而不是其他平台。


借助个人 Ubuntu Pro 计划，小规模用户现在可以享受 10 年安全保障（5 年 LTS 更新 + 5 年扩展安全维护更新），其中包括对额外 23,000 个软件包的支持。

这个免费的 Ubuntu Pro 订阅层的推出可以帮助 Canonical 吸引更多用户使用 Ubuntu，这对于计算机用户采用 Linux 来说是一件好事。

你只需在他们的 官方网站 上注册个人 Ubuntu Pro 订阅。

更多详情，请查看官方公告。


注册 Ubuntu Pro


💬 你会考虑选择免费的个人 Ubuntu Pro 订阅吗？ 或者，你认为你会每 5 年升级到新的 LTS 版本吗？

以下是 Martin 提到的内容：


用最近的标准来说，Ubuntu MATE 22.10 是一个适度更新，专注与“提高生活质量”。而这个版本的 Ubuntu MATE 没有采用你通常期望的桶状 🪣 变化清单是有原因的，这是因为我一直在帮助将 Ubuntu MATE 的完整体验带到 Debian MATE 🧉。


这是很吸引人的东西。

这是否意味着 Ubuntu MATE 未来不会有任何重大更新？

不，Ubuntu MATE 仍然会收到更新。

另外，Martin 还澄清说，他并没有退出 Ubuntu MATE 的开发，并且将和往常一样进行。

然而，如果你想看看 Ubuntu MATE 的主要功能更新的长列表，你必须要等待一段时间。

他打算在 Debian MATE 和 Ubuntu MATE 之间提供一致的体验。

Debian MATE 在用户中不那么受欢迎并不足为奇。主要是因为它不提供 Ubuntu MATE 那样的现代改进。

因此，他们的目标是为 Debian MATE 带来类似的体验，这将使现有用户既可以使用 Debian 也可以使用 Ubuntu。

**此外，**这将使开发变得更容易：


使 Debian 和 Ubuntu 中的 MATE 体验保持一致，使所有相关人员的维护变得更加容易。


那么，我们是否可以期待与 Debian 上是否能和 Ubuntu MATE 22.10（Kinetic Kudu）非常相似？



大概是。但这需要时间。


💡 他们希望在 Debian 12 的 Debian MATE 上提供类似的体验。我们已经知道 Debian 12 计划于 2023 年发布。因此，有足够的时间等待它。


你可以期待将 MATE Tweak 和 Ayatana Indicators 等应用程序集成到 Debian MATE 中。

这让我认为 Debian MATE 可以成为 Ubuntu MATE 用户寻求改变或想要尝试 Debian 的MATE 风格的绝佳选择。

当然，这并不会让即将到来的 Ubuntu MATE 22.10 变得不那么令人兴奋。它仍将包括许多有价值的好东西；你可能想查看它的 beta 版本说明 以了解更多信息。

💬 在了解了这一发展之后，你如何看待 Debian 未来的 MATE 版本？你会为此放弃 Ubuntu MATE 吗？让我知道你的想法！

                              <span>我在硅谷科技大厂工作，自20年初疫情爆发至今居家办公已有2年半。在此期间，为应对远程办公而打造的软件、平台、工具雨后春笋般涌现而发展壮大，工作中的沟通协同方式乃至绩效考核机制也随之发生了深刻的改变。相信如此大规模且持续的远程办公潮流在人类工业发展史上都是头一次，而这种趋势还将继续延续下去。
这股远程办公的潮流和趋势，对于身处其间的打工仔而言又有怎样的影响呢？首先要强调的是，远程办公也许并不适用于所有行业(至少在现阶段)，居家远程办公也未必适合所有人。
以我个人的经历而言，我的小孩在此期间出生现都已2岁有余，除此之外我还经历了买房升职。似乎远程办公的工作形式并没有对我的人生重要节点造成什么特别的影响。然而回过头来看又不能不承认，我的生活作息、社交活动与工作方式都已发生积极正面的改变。
居家办公始末
20年初，随着疫情的爆发和公司对于员工健康的关注，硅谷的科技公司陆续允许员工在家远程办公。除去极少数公司在初期就允诺疫情结束之后员工可以继续远程工作，绝大多数的公司还是给出了一个返回办公室的预定时间目标。不过由于漂亮国防疫政策的拉垮，这个预定时间不断地被推迟。直到疫苗的大规模铺开，最终在今年的5月前后，各大公司开始号召员工返回办公室。
2年多的远程办公已经深刻地改变了人们的生活方式：有人已经离开房价高企的硅谷或大都市搬迁到物价更低的偏远地区，有人因为家中有高危人群（老人或小孩）而不愿意回到办公司暴露在潜在的感染风险之中，有人单纯习惯了不用上下班通勤的生活而不再愿意花费时间去办公室。把四散各地的员工“驱赶”回办公室并非可一蹴而就。有感于此，大多数“开明”的公司都发布了混合办公的政策，即一周可以有若干个工作日在家办公（其余工作日仍然需要回到办公室）；又或者开放了永久远程办公的申请，为铁了心不回办公室的员工打开一个通道。某种程度而言，全员远程办公这件事情，已经在今年夏天结束。

                              <span>Notion is an awesome organizational tool I have been using for a long time. It has so many capabilities that it slowly replaced many other tools I use daily. One of the ways that I use Notion is to create content for my personal website.
My personal website is built as a static website. This means that I have to provide all the information I want inside the website before deploying it on the web. Once it is deployed, it doesn’t change. This means I must redeploy the website anytime I want to update it.
This might sound cumbersome, but it isn’t. Building, updating and deploying a website means a couple more steps are involved, but it doesn’t take much more time. Additionally, having a static website has some benefits in terms of performance, cost-effectiveness and resilience. A static websi…</span>

DC’s adding a new Ultra tier to its Universe Infinite comic book subscription service that lets you digitally read comics just one month after they hit store shelves (via Gizmodo). The new tier launches on Monday at an introductory price of $99 / year, but this price only lasts until November 28th and DC doesn&#x27;t specify how much it will cost after that.
Currently, users have to wait six months after a new comic hits DC Universe Infinite. While the new tier could make the service more attractive to diehard comic book fans, it’s considerably more expensive than the $74.99 / year or $7.99 / month standard subscription option.
In addition to a shorter launch window, DC’s throwing in 5,000 exclusive titles from Vertigo, DC Black Label, and...

Star Trek showed off the latest trailer for the final season of Picard at the New York Comic Con on Saturday, revealing some unexpected reappearances by legacy characters: hologram James Moriarty (Daniel Davis) and Data’s evil counterpart, Lore (Brent Spiner).
The trailer opens with Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) receiving a distress signal from Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), prompting him to band together with old friends from The Next Generation, including William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Geordi La Forge (Levar Burton), Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), and Worf (Michael Dorn). At the heart of the trouble is Vadic, a villain who appears to be played by Pulp Fiction’s Amanda Plummer.

While everyone is distracted by the recent announcement of the Google Pixel 7 lineup and the Pixel Watch, Wellbots has quietly provided The Verge Deals with an exclusive discount on the charcoal, fog, and lemongrass colorways of the Google Pixel Buds Pro. Normally $199.99, you can grab a pair of the delicious-looking earbuds for just $159.99 when you use the code VERGE40 at checkout — the best price yet. The Pixel Buds Pro are a massive improvement over the standard Pixel Buds, thanks to their enhanced reliability, multipoint Bluetooth support, and improved battery life. While the mic quality could be better and it lacks support for lossless audio, the Pixel Buds Pro remain an excellent choice for noise-canceling earbuds at this price...

The downturn in the chip industry started in the summer months, as crypto crashes caused blockchain miners to flood the market with previously hard-to-find graphics cards. Almost overnight, demand eased up and caused graphics hardware prices to drop by almost half. Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang admitted in August that the company made too many graphics cards that now it has to sell them for less money. But Nvidia isn’t alone in this mess.
Just last year, the only story about chips was that manufacturers couldn’t make enough of them to meet the strong demand for consumer electronics, cars, and other products that require semiconductors. But even as shortages continue for certain types of semiconductors, the story is becoming more nuanced,...

Rivian’s recalling 12,212 electric vehicles (EVs) over a loose fastener that could affect drivers’ ability to control the car (via CNBC). The recall affects nearly every vehicle Rivian has produced this year, and spans the carmaker’s entire lineup, covering certain 2022 R1T pickup trucks, R1S SUVs, as well as the electric delivery vans (EDVs) it&#x27;s building for Amazon. Rivian produced a total of 14,317 vehicles in the first three quarters of 2022 and delivered over 12,000.

                              <span>英伟达的“虚伪”开源

今年早些时候，或许是迫于黑客压力，英伟达宣布开源其内核驱动模块。这是否意味着会有更好的开源驱动？内核开发者 Dave Airlie 在 LPC 大会上对此做了解释：英伟达 2018 年发布的图灵系列引入了对系统处理器 GSP 的支持，GSP 是一个基于 RISC-V 的处理器，负责管理 GPU 上的其它处理器。它的固件容量高达 30 或 40MB，而早期的固件容量通常才 256KB。英伟达事实上是把它的部分私有驱动转移到了 GSP。英伟达的开源驱动只是提供了 GSP 的接口而已。

老王点评：所以，Torvalds 先生多年前就看穿了英伟达的本质，让我们一起竖起中指。




去中心化金融先锋将 5 亿美元投入美国国债和公司债券

2015 年推出的 MakerDAO 是挑战传统银行系统而设立的去中心化金融协议之一，其社区在 6 月底进行了初步投票，同意将 80% 的基金投入短期美国国债，20% 投入投资级企业债券。MakerDAO 周四发表声明，此举旨在使它的资产负债表多样化，价值 5 亿美元的通证将被转移到固定收益债务。

老王点评：颇有讽刺意味，就像以传统金融为假想敌的加密货币，却跟着股市一起涨跌。理想终究不及现实啊。




美国人宁愿削减食品支出也不愿意取消订阅服务

根据最近一份报告，大约三分之二的消费者表示将不得不减少支出；然而，只有大约四分之一的人计划在未来几个月取消流媒体订阅。报告发现，消费者最不可能取消亚马逊 Prime、Netflix 和 Spotify 以及家庭安全系统，甚至超过食品和汽油。一半的人表示，订阅服务现在占了他们每月支出的重要部分。平均而言，美国消费者每月花费约 135 美元的订阅支出，占他们每月预算的 17.8%。

                              <span>微软、谷歌、亚马逊、IBM 和甲骨文如今都在关注云上的 DevOps。这些大公司正在给企业提供 IT 自动化的服务。然而，DevOps 仍然在持续的演进中。DevSecOps、AIOps 和 NoOps 正在成为下一个流行词。


随着开发和管理人员看到及时交付高质量软件的商业价值，敏捷Agile方法论和 DevOps 也变得流行起来。拥有灵活的发布周期，并且交付具有可扩展scalable和可定制customizable的软件，是世界上每个企业的目标。通过将 CI/CD 工具和管道pipeline部署到云端，DevOps 使发布过程变得更加流畅。融合了 DevOps 的 Polyglot 微服务架构正在帮助企业降低总拥有成本（TCO）。他们现在有能力用渐进式网络应用程序和最新的 UI 框架升级他们的技术栈。总的来说，团队正在以更好的效率执行任务，并且正在开发高质量的软件模块。

自治 DevOps

容器和 DevOps 与云原生应用走到了一起。Kubernetes 和 Docker 正在被用作容器，一个新的名词 NoOps 现在正在流行。对于不同的容器，编排Orchestration都是一个重要的功能。为了扩展应用，开发环境中要创建容器集群。有一些新的容器正在进入云原生应用这个领域，比如 Mesos、Swarm、Openshift Rancher 和 Nomad。NoOps 有助于缩短编码周期，从而监控和管理应用程序。缺陷修复和热修复是不同的活动，它们都是 NoOps 的一部分。NoOps 有助于提高技术团队和业务运营人员之间的协同作用。它也有助于更好的监控、管理和流程自动化。NoOps 基础设施能够控制应用程序在云上的部署。企业从中获得的好处包括更好的交付、弹性的服务、更快的发布、良好的质量和 CI/CD 自动化。

DevSecOps

DevSecOps 算是另一个流行趋势，它与在开发操作中的安全问题有关。最近与漏洞vulnerabilities（log4j），安全泄露security breach（谷歌、脸书、微软），和安全攻击相关的问题增加了 DevSecOps 在企业中的重要性。左移shift left方法强调了在软件生命周期的早期处理安全性和质量的重要性。在架构阶段就需要考虑隐私和遵从性compliances（如 GDPR）。这有助于降低成本，并且提升软件交付的速度。审计工具和安全检查列表是 DevOps 工具和系统的一部分，现在我们称为 DevSecOps。

AIOps

AI DevOps 现在被称为 AIOps。据预测，将来 AI 应用会由 AIOps 来管理。与 AIOps 相关的工具和软件正在开发中，并且将很快发布首个版本。AI/ML 应用部署和模型更新可以由 AIOps 来处理。这将在工业 4.0Industry 4.0 以及数据科学中扮演重要角色。有一种观点认为，NoOps 将会是 AIOps 的最终形态。AIOps 包括数据集管理、模型训练、模型服务、元数据管理、模型更新和服务更新。分布式训练将由 AIOps 来完成，这会提供超参数hyper parameter优化，工作流程管理和“假设what if”的分析能力。

微服务配置管理

当前，DevOps 和微服务正在成为标准部署和架构蓝图architectural blueprints来实施。应用可以在模块级别上就进行扩展。微服务可以在简化缺陷修复和问题区域隔离上提供帮助。经过设计，微服务可以通过添加更多计算能力computing power的实例instances来进行扩展。但是当它们没有被正确实现的时候，数据安全和管理的问题就会突然出现。

平台即产品

云上的软件即服务Software as a Service和平台即产品Platform as a Product最近非常流行。通过加速向平台部署和功能交付，DevOps 使这些变成现实。从编码到上线阶段，CI/CD 管道有助于可视化应用的部署。持续交付、集成和部署都是 DevOps 的一部分。DevOps 生产线模拟工业生产线是未来要关注的。

DevOps 正在慢慢地向 DevSecOps 和 AIOps 转变。对于企业，NoOps 才是未来。现在需要的是减少与安全相关的攻击、事故和破坏发生。对于企业来说，数据安全和隐私的优先级更高，并且这些新技术都将在这方面有所帮助。

                              <span>Pop!_OS 22.10 将不会发布。所以，你将无法使用 GNOME 43…… 这里是原因。




Pop!_OS 是一个基于 Ubuntu 的 Linux 发行版，它提供了一个精心设计的用户体验以及强大的软件套件。

考虑到它带来的最新技术和桌面环境带来的有用的调整，Pop!_OS 发行版通常值得等待。

但是，你将无法获得 Pop!_OS 22.10 发行版。

System76 希望专注于开发其自己的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面环境，并在未来的版本中放弃 GNOME。😲

如果你不知道的话，这是我们对 Pop!_OS 的 COSMIC 桌面环境的旧报道，以供说明：




哦，哇哦！Pop!_OS Linux 开发人员正在创建一个基于 Rust 的新桌面环境


Pop!_OS 22.10 发行版将不会发布

一般在 Ubuntu 发布新的 LTS 和非 LTS 版本之后，Pop!_OS 发行版就会发布。

没有 Pop!_OS 22.10，一些用户可能会失望，因为他们无法在 Pop!_OS 上体验 GNOME 43。

感谢 OMG!Ubuntu! 发现了 Pop!_OS 开发人员 Michael Murphy 的这个 Reddit 评论。

Michael 提到：


我们将会把开发时间集中到 COSMIC 的 Rust 实现上，而不是 22.10。支持多个 Ubuntu 版本需要很大的努力，而 6 个月的发布周期真的会吃掉开发时间和产品的稳定性。


👏 我相信这是一个很好的决定。去年，当他们宣布了基于 Rust 从头开始构建桌面环境的计划时，我总是想知道他们如何做到的。

从头开始做一件事并达到用户的期望是一项艰巨的任务，这些用户已经在基于 GNOME 的 Pop!_OS 上拥有了很好的体验。

COSMIC 桌面环境



看到 COSMIC 桌面环境的更多发展会很有趣。上次我们尝试它（或看到演示）时，用户会对它感到兴奋，即使它们只是刚刚开始。

从技术上讲，它自 2021 年以来就一直在开发中，2023 年的 Pop!_OS 发行版将会带来它。

它使用 Rust 编程语言编写，遵循 freedesktop 互操作性规范，并完全移除了对 GNOME 和其 shell 扩展的依赖。

我们曾经介绍过 COSMIC 桌面环境的早期预览构建，你可以在这里查看：




我尝试了 System76 新的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面！


为什么这是件好事？

Pop!_OS 的 LTS 版本已经收到了比 Ubuntu 更多的包更新和内核升级，所以你不必担心没有发布 22.10 版本。

相反，我们应该期待 Pop!_OS 的下一个主要升级，那时他们会正式介绍 Rust-COSMIC 桌面环境。

💬 你对这个决定怎么看？你对未来的 Pop!_OS 发行版有什么期待吗？

在不久之前，我写了一篇文章，大概讲了一下我认为出国留学「摄影」这件事对我而言的几个较有价值的部分，其中有一点是获得了「从学术的角度出发理解摄影」的一个方法。今天我就打算展开讲讲我从英国这个摄影的「发源地」学到的方法论之——如何理解摄影，希望和大家一同探讨。
需要提醒的是，这篇文章里有一些学术概念，我已经用了尽量简单易懂的方式表述，但出于对「信息传递更精准」的目的，我依然保留了一些可能不好理解的名词，建议大家收藏本文，慢慢看。
首先，我想先对「理解摄影」这个话题加上一个更具体的语境，即——如何用一种具有创造性的方式理解摄影，而这也是我们上个学年在讨论的一个核心议题：「The central question will be how to read photographic images in an innovative manner. 」。
正如上面提到的，「用创造性的方式解读摄影」，这个表述背后事实上是默认了在「创造性 」的解读照片的方式背后还有一种「非创造性」的方式解读照片。那么所谓的「非创造性」和「创造性」指的是什么呢？让我们先从「非创造性」开始说起。
「非创造性」——摄影的本质
首先，要从沃克·埃文斯（Walker Evans）在 1931 年写的一篇名为《摄影的重生》（The Reappearance of Photography）的文章说起。这篇文章里提到了尤金·阿杰特（Eugene Atget）、史泰钦（Edward Steichen）、阿尔伯特·伦格-帕茨（Renger Patzsch）等多位摄影师的作品，并对他们有…</span>

                              <span>苹果 M1 上的原生 Linux GPU 驱动？它就快来了！




让 Linux 在 苹果芯片Apple Silicon 设备上工作是我们很多人的愿望!

感谢 Asahi Linux 项目，它现在对测试者来说已经成为现实。当然，它还没有准备好进入最佳时期，但如果你是一个资深 Linux 用户，你现在就可以在苹果 M1/M2 设备上尝试 Linux。

现在，Linux 开发者 Asahi Lina 的一个令人兴奋的进展引起了我们所有人的注意。

我们可能会比预期更早地拥有一个用 Rust 编写的原生 GPU 驱动程序。

所以，这意味着什么？

几个月前，Asahi Lina 加入了 Asahi Linux 项目，并开始 开发一个驱动程序原型 以在 Linux 上运行图形应用程序。

现在，通过更多的调整和一些来自 Asahi Lina 对 M1 GPU 硬件接口的逆向工程的惊人的贡献，她已经成功地在苹果 M1 芯片上运行了 GNOME、KDE 应用程序，做到了在 Firefox 上播放 YouTube 等事情！

以下是她 推特 的内容：


GNOME 运行了！！Firefox 浏览器可以运行！你可以看 YouTube，玩 Neverball，运行 KDE 应用程序，以及更多！! 没有崩溃！！！

在苹果 M1 的原生 Linux GPU 驱动上！!


需要注意的是，这还没有在苹果 M2 上测试过。

这里还有个视频，你可以看到它运行的情况：




她还解释说：


我使用了一个糟糕的黑科技来解决一个稳定性问题，这影响了性能，但它证明了这是唯一剩下的主要问题！一旦我把它修复好了，我们就会有完整的性能和稳定性！然后就只剩下 Mesa 驱动程序的修复了！！！


当然，这还只是处于早期的开发，我们甚至没有在 Linux 内核中拥有 Rust 实现。所以，当 Rust 开始进入主线版本时，也就是 Linux 内核 6.1 或更新版本时，你可能会看到它越来越接近现实。

尽管如此，这对 Asahi Linux 来说是一个不可思议的里程碑。随着一些发展，用户一定急于在苹果芯片设备上尝试 Linux。

                              <span>Fedora 37（和 36）可能不再允许你使用一些流行的编解码器来方便地使用视频的图形加速功能。




Fedora 是一个流行的 Linux 发行版，迎合了那些希望在他们的工作站（和服务器）上使用最先进技术的用户。

它没有搭载任何专有组件，默认情况下坚持使用完全开源的软件库。

虽然这对一些人来说已经很不方便了，但现在看来，另一个变化可能会困扰期待 Fedora 37 的用户。

最近在 Fedora 上的一个 Mesa 的提交 告诉我们，由于法律问题，H.264、H.265 和 VC-1 编解码器的视频加速 API（VAAPI）的支持已经被禁用。

这一变化可能也会被回传到 Fedora 36。


💡 H.264 是大多数视频行业使用的主流视频编解码器。

例如，苹果公司广泛使用 H.264 编解码器，用于 iPhone 手机拍摄的照片和视频。你可以阅读此 文档 来了解更多。


Fedora 项目论坛的一位成员 首先发现 了 Fedora 中的这一变化，他将其描述为 “F36 的一大退步”。

这对 Fedora 用户来说是坏消息吗？

是的，基本上是的。

主要是，它将影响使用开源驱动程序的 AMD GPU 用户，阻止他们使用 GPU 加速 来播放需要使用这些编解码器的视频内容。

此外，它还会影响到 任何使用开源图形驱动的用户，即使他们在英特尔芯片上运行 iGPU。Fedora 开发者还没有对此提供任何澄清，但你可以自己测试一下。

如果你在英伟达显卡上使用专有驱动程序，你就没有什么可担心的。

运行旧硬件的用户也可能有问题，他们的系统可能不支持这些编解码器。

这些编解码器最常用在你从 BT 或各种服务中下载的视频中，这些视频还没有转移到更新一代的编解码器（如 AV1 和 VP9）。

我相信，这是互联网上的大部分视频的情况。

一些流媒体平台也使用这些编解码器在其各自的平台上提供内容，这可能导致用户在试图通过其服务访问内容时面临问题。

这是否影响到每个人？

如果你是那些观看 YouTube 视频的人，不使用任何需要这些编解码器的视频的平台或下载它们，你就不会有任何问题。

Fedora 正在避免法律上的麻烦

还没有人起诉 Fedora 或强迫他们这样做。然而，正如 Phoronix 所指出的，Mesa 的一个变化最近允许开发者选择性地禁用编解码器，以帮助避免法律纠纷和软件专利冲突。

因此，为了避免法律上的混乱，Fedora 进行了这一改变。

H.264 和 H.265 的专利属于一家名为 MPEG LA 的公司，该公司专门用于持有视频编解码器和显示标准领域的专利。

而 VC-1 的专利属于 SMPTE，这是一个由媒体和娱乐机构的专业人士管理的团体。

考虑到用户在购买显卡时已经支付了使用这些编解码器的许可，我们仍然不确定为什么会这样。你可以在 Fedora 的法律列表会话 中阅读更多相关信息。

可能的解决方法是什么？

显然，你必须依赖基于 CPU 的解码了。当然，你也可以使用官方或第三方的 Mesa 构建版本。

Flatpak 应用程序可能允许你观看图形加速的视频内容而没有问题。但是，这要取决于软件的维护者。

但是，对于大多数用户来说，这可能是一个不方便的解决方案。

另一个解决方法可能是在旨在包含第三方应用程序的 RPM Fusion 仓库中单独包含支持 VAAPI 的编解码器。

然而，负责 Fedora RPM Fusion 仓库的开发者对维护 Fedora Mesa 3D 的复刻版本不感兴趣。该开发者提到：


rpmfusion 基本上没有兴趣去打包和维护它，而且保持仓库与 Fedora 同步对我来说也不是一个优先事项。

Open Jam game jam is happening from October 28 to November 9 this year. Every year for the past several years, programmers from around the globe build open source video games, and then play and rate one another&#x27;s games. Just for fun.
Open Jam is a &quot;game jam,&quot; which is a casual way to inspire programmers of all skill levels to focus on a just-for-fun project for a concentrated period of time. It promotes open source games as well as open source game creation tools.

              My name is Frank 👋
I’m a software developer and an engineering manager at my day job. For years I have had side projects, developing small projects, because I feel I’m not satisfying my urge to the craft, to develop. Develop something from nothing, getting an idea and building it. The most satisfying and productive feeling I can think of.

I started as a software developer, and am now an engineering manager at a medium sized fintech company in Denmark. As my role and responsibilities have changed, I noticed a lack of coherence and vision of mine and my colleagues day-to-day tasks. We would have all sorts of long term goals and roadmaps, but no structure to navigate through our everyday tasks.

We run everything through GitHub™, and works great for issue tracking and keepin…</span>

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol based on SSLv3 designed to encrypt and decrypt traffic between two sites. In other words, TLS ensures that you&#x27;re visiting the site you meant to visit and prevents anyone between you and the website from seeing the data being passed back and forth. This is achieved through the mutual exchange of digital certificates: a private one that exists on the web server, and a public one typically distributed with web browsers.
In production environments, all servers run securely, but server certificates may expire after some period. It is then the server&#x27;s responsibility to validate, regenerate, and reuse newly genera…</span>

@甜食：神藤毛巾内毛圈浴巾

入手渠道：淘宝
入手价格：370 元

最近因为搬家，许多生活用品需要重新购买，其中自然也包括各类卫浴洗漱用品这种又占空间、单价又便宜，导致搬走不如买新的的物件。在物色新浴巾的时候，我发现了神藤毛巾这个品牌。神藤毛巾是日本大阪的毛巾品牌，有别于传统的毛圈表面的毛巾，他们的产品以棉纱材质的毛巾见长。
传统毛巾的毛圈材质表面积更大，用来清洁自然是效率更高的，不过生活在南方的读者应该多少都会有潮湿天气下毛巾连日难以风干，甚至产生异味的经验，神藤的毛巾采用了多层纱布的织法，既保证了良好的吸水性，疏松的质地也让毛巾更加速干，同时比较平滑的表面也提供了更清爽的触感。
我最终购买的这款产品叫作 Inner Pile，算是神藤毛巾比较创新的一款产品（和很多刻板印象中的日本作坊式品牌一样，他们总共只有三款产品 —— 另外两款是多层棉纱毛巾「2.5-PLY GAUZE」和传统的毛圈毛巾「YUKINE」，具体用途只通过尺寸来区分），由外层的两层纱布夹着中间的一层毛圈构成。由于中间的毛圈层，这款毛巾的吸水性比纯纱布的毛巾更胜一筹，整体也更蓬松，摸起来甚至有点冬天棉衣的蓬松感，但又非常轻。外层的纱布又保证了清爽的触感，格外适合作为浴巾使用。
毛巾的近距离状态，可以看到多层疏松透光的结构毛巾的标签，我到手之后直接把标签拆了，没有拍到新品缝在毛巾上的样子
我这些年的一个经验是，从所谓改善生活质量的角度出发，买更多更好更贵的大件（如电子产品）带来的幸福感往往远不如买一些高品质的小件生活用品。…</span>

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a standard for how computers, servers, and people communicate within a system. It was the first standard model for network communications and was adopted in the early 1980s by all major computer and telecommunications companies.
The OSI model provides a universal language for describing networks and thinking about them in discrete chunks, or layers.
Layers of the OSI model
The model describes the seven layers through which computer systems communicate over a network.
Application layer
Presentation layer
Session layer
Transport layer
Network layer
Data link layer
Physical layer
Each of these layers has its own way of working, with its own set of protocols that disti…</span>

Apache ShardingSphere, a powerful distributed database, recently released a major update to optimize and enhance its features, performance, testing, documentation, and examples. In short, the project continues to work hard at development to make it easier for you to manage your organization&#x27;s data.
1. SQL audit for data sharding
The problem: When a user executes an SQL query without the sharding feature in large-scale data sharding scenarios, the SQL query is routed to the underlying database for execution. As a result, many database connections are occupied, and businesses are severely affected by a timeout or other issues. Worse still, should the user perform an UPDATE/DELETE operation,…</span>

今年，赛博朋克的风又刮了起来。一部《赛博朋克：边缘行者》的热播动画，不仅让游戏《赛博朋克2077》的玩家数量暴涨近400%，也让赛博朋克风再度成为亚文化讨论焦点。而说起赛博朋克美学，则绕不开一座城——香港。
香港街头琳琅满目的霓虹灯招牌，曾是赛博朋克视觉想象的灵感之源，但时至今日，这些霓虹魅影正在被拆除、消亡、遗忘。
01.赛博朋克的视觉语言
「Cyberpunk」一词源自1983年美国作家Bruce Bethke创作的短篇小说，是「Cybernetics」与「Punk」的结合词。「Cybernetics」是一种「关于在动物和机器中控制和通信」的科学研究，又称模控学，「Punk」则是由1960年代摇滚乐流派延伸出来的词，指涉那些对主流社会充满反叛精神的边缘人群。
《赛博朋克：边缘行者》中的主角出身贫民阶层
赛博朋克作品一般设定在科技高度发达的近未来，模控化的义体人或仿生人被大量应用，同时，这样的社会又往往被极权政府、跨国财团或秘密组织所掌控，导致贫富差距严重，恶劣的生存环境刺激底层punk们进行反叛。因此，高科技、低生活的反乌托邦景象成为赛博朋克作品的鲜明特征。
而赛博朋克的视觉化构建，是早于这个词诞生的。
1982年的电影《银翼杀手》，可以说是奠定了赛博朋克视觉美学的基础。片中总是雨水潮湿的街道、鱼龙混杂的路边摊、荧光闪烁的立面装饰、英文与亚洲文字混杂的霓虹灯招牌……成为众多观众心目中对于赛博朋克的经典印象，导演雷德利·斯科特曾经表示，这些布景的感觉是参考了「天气很差时的香港街道」。

1995年的动画电影《攻壳机动队》则将香港与赛博朋克更紧密地联系在一起。导演押井守认为21世纪的亚洲将主导未来世界的发展，而香港是当时其他城市效仿的对象，于是他选择了香港作为片中未来大都会「新港市」的想象蓝本。

You may often hear someone claim a computer, tablet, or smartphone is &quot;obsolete.&quot; When you hear such a statement, take a minute to ask yourself, &quot;Is this person speaking an opinion or a fact?&quot;
Many times, their statement is an opinion. Let me explain why.
When someone declares a computer &quot;obsolete,&quot; they often speak from their own point of view. So, if you&#x27;re a technology professional, a five-year-old computer might indeed be obsolete. But is that same five-year-old computer obsolete to a refugee family fleeing war or famine? Probably not. A computer that is obsolete for you might be a dream computer for someone else.

                              <span>一阵秋雨过后，忽然就意识到气温的变化，于是给衣橱换季也不得不提上了日程。
从收拾夏日衣物并分批洗涤，到把冬衣填进衣柜、不再穿的衣服送去衣物回收，一共用了三四天的时间。其中大部分时间都用在洗涤和晾晒，专门用来收拾布局的只有不到一天的时间。
之前的每次换季都不可避免地会撞上搬家，所以正儿八经的衣橱换季还是第一次。以下就是我这次整理衣橱的心得，另有对消费和断舍离的反思，希望对你有所帮助。
第一步：辞旧
此处的「旧衣服」指的是夏季的衣物，还有一些不打算再穿的衣服。
夏季出汗多，为了防止汗渍沉积，因此需要在收纳前清洗干净。如果是年初的冬夏换季，需要注意的是不能烘干的毛衣等需要更长的时间手洗、晾干，可能需要提前预留更多时间。
第一步就是把所有冬天不准备再穿的衣服都拿出来，掏干净口袋后分门别类放进不同的洗衣袋里。我的分类依据主要是洗涤方式：只可机洗不能烘干的，以及可机洗可烘干，深浅分开，一共四筐。另外还有一个纸箱，专门用来放不准备再穿的衣物。
 
洗涤先从至少需要过夜晾干的娇贵衣服开始，然后是可烘干的那些。中间我留了足够的时间，以确保大部分的衣服都能在差不多的时间内足够干爽，可以安心放进储藏室而不用担心发霉。
接下来，就是把所有衣服，按照洗涤方式分类放入收纳箱。家里的教诲是「把娇贵的衣服放在最上层才不容易被压坏」，但以我对自己的了解，天气热起来的时候肯定直接从最上层拿衣服，所以在上层放好洗的普通衣物总没错；同理，冬装收纳的最上层也是轻薄的毛衣。
这个过程中，我没有把所有洗干净的衣服都放进收纳箱，而是专门留下了许多不打算再穿的衣服。关于我的「断舍离」，会在后面有一节详细讲述。
而收起来准备明年再穿的衣服，都和一小块檀香皂放进可密封的袋子里，明年拿出来再穿的时候，衣服上就自然染上好闻的香气了！除了檀香皂，还可以尝试樟木球、香挂，以及切成小段、放进纸袋里的线香，都是可以持续散发香气、且味道不会…</span>

前言
开始的时候我就决定了，未来哪天必定要写这样的一篇阶段性总结文章，只不过那时设想的时间点远在第十个视频之后，而这天的到来比我所预期的要早很多，因为很幸运地提前完成了一个年初定下的小目标，全网 5 万关注达成了。
也因为我的账号起源与少数派这个网站有莫大关系，所以选择将这篇长文首发于此，希望能帮到对运营 B 站有想法、以及对视频剪辑工具有需求的同学。

数字文具盒征文活动 中看到许多将 Obsidian 纳入日常学习工作流的好文章，想必使用过程中或多或少都与命令（command）打过交道。所谓命令，其实就是在 Obsidian 执行的各种操作：新建文档、星标文档、打开大纲面板等常规操作，以及所有与插件的交互、使用快捷键执行的操作……这些都是命令。
和许多文本编辑器一样，Obsidian 内建了一个命令面板（Command Palette），用于快速搜索并执行命令。默认的快捷键 ⌘+P 唤起方便是方便，只不过这个内建的命令面板还是略显简陋了：只能搜索，顶多在设置中将常用命令置顶，就没了。它没办法记忆最近使用的项目，每次都要重新查找；并且文本编辑、核心插件、社区插件的命令一股脑儿混在一起，很多 几乎永远用不到的命令，由于首字母的关系，排名却很靠前。
尽管 Obsidian 一直在更新，也已经增加了许多呼声颇高的内容（比如 窗口多开），但还是没有往命令面板上做文章。你可能会说，常用的命令，用用快捷键就好了呀。不过我的系统全局快捷键已经很多了，所以除了极为常用的诸如加粗（⌘+B）这种命令，我还是倾向用快捷键以外的方式去执行命令。
那么本文将介绍三款优秀的社区插件，让 Obsidian 的命令更为好用。

写在前面：

本文若涉及快捷键，那么 modifier key 将会使用 Mac 标准的 ⌘、⌥、⇧ 等，Windows 系统请相应替换。
随着 Obsidian 的更新，许多插件已不再适配或是迁移、合并至新的版本。本文推荐的插件都是写作时点（2022-09-20）能够使用的。

                              <span>前言
为了在上班前再抓紧时间享受一下旅行的快乐，我和女朋友一起去了一趟杭州和绍兴。十年前，我和父母曾经去过一次杭州和苏州，但那时正值盛夏，酷暑难耐，我的父亲出行时又是出了名的紧张和暴躁，导致少了不少游玩的乐趣，杭州在我心目中也并没有留下什么深刻的印象。在一位杭州「土著」同学的怂恿下，为了帮助杭州洗刷这个对她并不公平的心理评价，我决定再来一次杭州。
按照这位同学说，我们这一次来得正是时候，赶上了杭州为期两周的秋天，早来了太热，晚来了太冷。
她是没错的。九月底的杭州真的是——好舒服啊！
除了正午那几个小时，杭州的天气这几天一直稳定在很适宜的温度，在室内和室外几乎没有温差。哪怕是上午快十二点，大晴天走在大街上也只是有丝丝暖意，如果这时候有几阵微风从西湖吹来，送上岸边荷叶清新的香气和清凉，我就会情不自禁地把手臂张开，闭上眼睛，好好感受这让人舒服得跺脚的惬意。
因为我们这一次以休闲游为主，并没有安排很满的行程，这几天都是睡到自然醒，吃完饭中午才出门，所以行程上也安排得不是很有效率。作为一个旅行攻略太过勉强，但也确确实实享受到了放空身心的那种悠闲和惬意。
灵隐寺
食
很惭愧，这一次是摆烂的行程。因为不想时间太紧张，所以并没有专门搜一些当地人才会去的苍蝇馆子，吃的都是比较常见的连锁餐厅，外婆家、新白鹿、绿茶。我这个外地人尝不出地不地道，但坐着挺舒适，味道也挺好的。我特别喜欢西湖天地那家外婆家，旁边就是西湖，吃完饭去消消食也是一流的。
第一天晚上杭州的同学带我们去银泰附近吃了一家名为杭州酒家的餐厅。据说已经有一百年历史了。叫花鸡被一层壳包裹，需要客人颇具仪式感地亲自敲几下，而后师傅再帮忙敲开，鸡肉已经酥软无比，香味甚至渗进了骨头；熏鱼比我想象中的多汁，带着一种甜甜的味道；藕粉样子很好看，但感觉味道稍淡了些，响铃沾了不同的酱料味道很丰富。

Awk is a powerful scripting tool that makes it easy to process text. Awk scripts use a pattern-action syntax, where Awk performs an action for every line in a file that matches a pattern. This provides a flexible yet powerful scripting language to deal with text. For example, the one-line Awk script /error/ {print $1, $2, $3} will print the first three space-delimited fields for any line that contains the word error.
While we also have the GNU variant of Awk, called Gawk, the original Awk remains under development. Recently, Brian Kernighan started a project to add Unicode support to Awk. I met with Brian to ask about the origins of Awk and his recent development work on Awk.

                              <span>2021年9月，也许是某一个灵光乍现的瞬间，也许是受到学姐和其他老师重读红楼梦的触动，我开始对红楼梦感到好奇：到底是怎样的一本小说，能成为一代又一代人终身治学的根基。考虑到我浅薄的文化素养，直接阅读文本收益不大，于是曲线救国，从他人的解读开启红楼之旅，所以试听了被高频推荐的《欧丽娟讲红楼梦》。

一入坑就被深深抓住了，198讲，每讲1.5～2h，听之前觉得太多了这怎么可能听得完，听之后感觉时间过得飞快，书里的时间，视频里的时间，还有现实生活中的时间，三条时间线交织重叠，构筑成一个亦真亦幻的世界。
这篇文稿不是为了总结300多小时的视频内容，只是作为一个外行人，分享在窥探瑰丽文学世界时的一些发现，以及这段经历给我带来的改变，包括对红楼梦观感的变化，对学问的深入理解，以及对自身心智模型的重塑。
书中的道理--超越风花雪月，草木荣枯
听完198讲红楼梦，更新了我对红楼梦的认知。目前我对红楼梦的理解，从它是一部关于贵族爱情的小说，变成了它是一部关于人的小说。
金玉良缘与木石前盟，映射着青春期的少男少女对爱情的懵懂。在我还没有足够的耐心去咀嚼优美的文字和艺术的行为前，一连串的言辞已经给我大脑一种“我已知晓此书”的信号：忧郁柔弱的林妹妹和纯真无邪的富家贵公子，爱而不得和包办婚姻，隐忍的，圣洁的；凄清的，热闹的；荒凉的，繁盛的……，构成了红楼的初印象：首先，世界并不只围绕着我；其次，即便如此，我也会被人无条件地坚定地选择。这种印象也可以被概括为：才子佳人模式。
曾经关注发生在人身上的情感流转，视频将我的视角转移到人本身。描写人物关系和个体命运的小说有那么多，红楼梦的精妙之处，是超越了风花雪月，草木荣枯。
每一个人物专论，都很容易让人产生强烈两个阶段的情绪共鸣。第一阶段，太真实了，这不就是我嘛。他们身上有非常鲜明的人格特质，其行事逻辑也能在我们身上找到影子。于国于家无望的宝玉，虽柔弱不安也…</span>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

首先，非常开心少数派上婉莹和甜食大大的播客制作栏目《100 小时后请叫我播客主理人》终于上线了，两位都是我很尊敬的播客制作者，之前也和两位有过关于播客和其他领域（比如音乐收藏和泉州故事）的交流，相信这个栏目一定会给到各位对于播客有兴趣的朋友很多帮助。
关于如何制作播客的相关教程，互联网上已经不少了，我自己之前也和生产力维基的白宦成合作过一期简单教学版本《小白和大耳的播客入门指南》，私下里我也在深圳线下做过几次关于制作播客的心得分享。很多教程和指南往往会集中在技术，设备，内容策划和运营等等方面，是一种「法」或者「术」层面上的描述，对于大多数的个人播客制作者，尤其是以兴趣为出发点的制作者来说，往往看了一些指南以后，就「一时兴起」录制并上传了自己的第一期节目，然后经历了一段时间的「方兴未艾」后，在某个时间突然因为繁忙的工作打断了「周更」的节奏，于是「戛然而止」。我自己的节目《对讲鸡 RadioChicken》也经历过几次这样的过程，曾经我也对诸如断更和订阅数减少（即使现在小宇宙的订阅只有 300 多个，最近几十个还都是各种社交 app 认识的）感到失落甚至焦虑，但经历了一些列佛系的思考后，我发现制作播客对我自己的意义，完全不在于「向外展示性表达」，更多的喜悦和快乐，反而在于「向内探索性成长」。
所以今天我想就此分享一些关于「向内探索性成长」的心得，希望对于各位对于播客有兴趣，甚至已经开始制作播客的朋友有所启发。
降低期待
我给新人播客制作者的第一个建议，是做好「降低期待，甚至不要有期待」的心理建设。我相信可能会有部分朋友开始做播客的原因…</span>

Over the past few months, the Podman project has been reworking its process for generating Debian and Ubuntu packages. This article outlines the past and present of the Debian packaging work done by the Podman project team. Please note that this article does not refer to the official Debian and Ubuntu packages that Reinhard Tartler and team created and maintain.
Debian build process
Long story short, the typical Debian build process involves &quot;Debianizing&quot; an upstream repository. First, a debian subdirectory containing packaging metadata and any necessary patches is added to the upstream repo. Then the dpkg-buildpackage command is run to generate the .deb packages.

                              <span>我的 AirPods Pro 2 还没发货，我的 AirPods Pro 1 已经吃灰很久。AirPods Pro 的耳塞我越来越戴不稳，再加上比较「白开水」的调音，以及削弱后的主动降噪效果，让我觉得虽然 AirPods Pro 综合体验不错，但总是少了点意思，对我这个 PC 玩家来说使用场景也有些窄。
在 PC 上玩游戏，我始终不喜欢用头戴耳机，太大一坨挂头上，戴久了累，耳朵闷，还压头发。习惯各种无线 TWS 之后，我也无法再适应回去用有线耳机，有根线扯着，会极大降低我起身活动的频率。所以 TWS 真无线耳塞一直是我的心头好。
以我常玩的 PUBG 为例，PC 桌面端能用来打游戏的真无线耳塞，至少必须得延迟够低，才有可能听声辨位，这样的耳塞市面上少之又少。所以很自然地，踩中我的喜好和需求的怒喵 CYBERBLADE 在发售后，我第一时间就上手并主力用了一段时间。所以这篇文章，我想分享一些我的体验感受。内容比较主观，没有受任一方干涉。
先说结论：抛开前期我也不喜欢的营销方式不谈，上手后的 CYBERBLADE 本身没有让我失望。它主打的桌面端体验不错，实物的质感挺好，佩戴舒适度和音质也有超出我预期，虽然缺点短板都有，但它确实可以称得上是我用过的最好的 PC 桌面端 TWS，而且，没有之一。
我是不是说得太满？请注意定语——「PC 桌面端 TWS」。就像我刚说的，PC 桌面端、能低延迟打游戏的真无线耳塞，市面上的可选项就没两个，这个垂直细分品类太小众，愿意像怒喵这样认真做一个偏高端定位好产品的厂商，更是没有。
你可以说怒喵只是在讨巧，从成熟的音频市场，挑了个没什么竞争的品类来做，没啥了不起；但对我这种目标受众来说，有人做了我需要的东西，并且除了核心的桌面低延迟游戏体验 OK 之外，还做出了别家没有的特色，就很棒。

这篇文章将介绍，我为什么以及如何将自动化数据处理应用到 Notion 当中。并通过我实际的案例，介绍自动化工具 Zapier 的用法，分享我的使用体验。
数据更新和维护的不智能，让 Notion 的使用体验变得糟糕
随着 Notion 功能的不断完善，越来越多的人会选择使用 Notion 作为自己的第二大脑。无论是构建个人的知识网络、保存整理数据信息、还是展示自己的数字世界的成就，这些场景中，Notion 提供的功能都显得游刃有余。此外，得益于 Notion 可以高度个人定制化以及提供在线编辑的特性，用 Notion 管理待办事项，规划日程，同步团队信息，乃至于记账、写博客这种更进阶的用法，使用 Notion 都可以让数据为用户服务，一切变得井井有条。
操作的不便
但是，所谓凡事有一利就有一弊。在 Notion 当中构建的精巧且复杂的数据库，不仅意味着数据在展示层面上的美观和应用层面上的便利，同时也意味着需要在数据的更新维护上花更多的时间和精力。
按照我自己的使用习惯，我在 Notion 当中搭建了任务管理的数据库和财务管理的数据库。这其中有着大量的数字格式的数据存储在其中。但是因为 Notion 当中并不支持直接将数据进行运算得出结果
例如，数字一栏记录的值是 100，并不能通过直接填写 「+10」得到 110，数字数据的更新是需要删除原有的数据，并把计算好的新结果填入原来的位置。

在 PC 端或网页端，这样的操作还勉强可以接受，但是在手机的 App 上，这样的操作就显得过于麻烦。更…</span>

沿江而行
如果你来武汉的时间只有一天，那去江边走上一天，便可以心中有谱地说出：我去过武汉了。那些或声势显赫或寂寂无名的景色，许许多多便是散布在长江汉水之畔的。
汉口江滩
漫步路线：江汉路-江汉关-武汉科学技术馆-汉口江滩
江汉路
每个城市里都有一条名号最响的路，在北京是王府井大街，在上海是南京路，在广州是上下九，在武汉自然就是江汉路了，江汉路很长，它的一头伸到了江边，另一头连着解放大道，被誉为「天下第一步行街」。江汉路在清末时期叫做广利巷，是商人集资修建来往贸易之用的。1861 年，汉口开埠之后，洋人也是看中了这里的临江的交通便利之处，便在广利巷附近的地盘上相继建立租界，江汉路便逐渐形成。现今江汉路著名的建筑，即是当年各个租界遗留的场所。
江汉路沿路与江汉一、二、三路，黎黄陂路，保成路，水塔街等道路相连。弯弯绕绕，一转身，便可以看到不同风景。黎黄陂路是旧时汉口俄租界上的街道改造而成，作为一条拥有百年历史的老路，黎黄陂路见证着滚滚的历史车轮从此经过，漫步在这里，主要体会宁静，在老时光咖啡馆里享受一段悠然时光，在小物商行里欣赏别出心裁的饰件，或是在路上发发呆，看一看那些时不时提着婚纱走过的新人。保成路是承袭了几十年不断演变的夜市，短短几百米的道路上承载了近千家小商贩，漫步在这里…</span>

Open source is a flourishing and beneficial ecosystem that publicly solves problems in communities and industries using software developed through a decentralized model and community contributions. Over the years, this ecosystem has grown in number and strength among hobbyists and professionals alike. It&#x27;s mainstream now—even proprietary companies use open source to build software.
With the ecosystem booming, many developers want to get in and build new open source projects. The question is: How do you achieve that successfully?

从这里开始
目前我在用的笔记系统，用一句很简单的话概括就是：本地 markdown 文件 + Dropbox 网盘同步，同时用 Vscode 项目把整个笔记目录管理起来。
大概几年前，我正在 Evernote 、有道云笔记、OneNote 之间反复横跳。当时还没有 Notion，也没有 Roam Research，甚至 PKM（个人知识管理）都很少有人提及。
最后还是选择了本地 markdown 这种「看似不便」的方式，毕竟原生的 markdown有种种缺点（图片管理、没有 Metadata、不支持复杂排版），本地文件的方式摆脱不了树状文件夹的笔记结构……甚至在当时缺少非常顺手的编辑器。但这些年修修补补也一直用下来了，上面提到的种种缺点也都改善或规避，期间也尝试过 Notion、RoamResearch、Logseq，但这种 「基于本地 markdown」的笔记一直都是我的笔记系统基本盘。

 
这种方案的好处是：

数据完全属于自己，Dropbox 网盘 + 自己写的定时脚本备份到 Git ，双重措施可以确保笔记不会丢失，也能通过 Git 的历史追溯修改历史、查看笔记系统的生长过程；
最好的同步体验（Dropbox） + 最好的现代编辑器（Vscode）：Dropbox 的多设备同步近乎实时，并且增量同步非常适合 markdown 这种轻量文本，如果上网不便可以用坚果等其他同步盘替代，如果你用 苹果全家桶且能忍受 iCloud Drive 的同步1，它也是可以的 。至于最好的编辑器……还是看个人习惯吧，现代的编辑器诸如 Su…</span>

                              <span>使用 Obsidian 的过程中发现一些痛点：
1&gt; 使用插件 annotator 时，引用的文本内不能添加链接

如果强行将关键字改成链接，就会出现格式错乱

我想要的效果如下：引用的文本能够给添加链接

2&gt; 使用简悦剪藏文章时 ，文章内的图片是外链。如果图片是外链，那么如果外链链接失效了就找不回图片了

我想要的效果如下：将外链转为图床的链接

3&gt; Media Extended 虽然能使用链接跳转到视频指定时间点，但是手写链接太麻烦了

我想要的效果：自动生成一个视频的全部字幕和引用，且每句字幕和一点时间点引用呈一一对应的关系

❗❗❗为了节省大家的时间，我在文末写了我常用的 Obsidian 插件的下载链接，这些插件中有部分插件的源码都是被我修改过的，有两个需要注意的事项：

被我修改过源码的插件不全是可以直接用的，比如发送图片到 Picgo 时的 url 要换成你在 Picgo 内设置的 url
修改过源码的插件不要升级，如果升级了会导致修改失效

❗❗❗再附加一个注意事项：

入门简悦的时候如果运气不好（比如我），会遇到很多问题，如果看了入门文章还是解决不了就到 https://github.com/Kenshin/simpread/issues 提交自己的问题，简悦的开发者回复消息还是挺快的（顺便夸夸开发者很积极，这很难得）

                              <span>在以前的文章中，我对笔记软件和写作软件按照类别进行了梳理，参见《盘点那些具有特色的笔记软件》、《盘点那些具有特色的写作软件》。今天承接这一系列，介绍《盘点那些具有特色的电子白板软件》。
在思维导图、概念图之外，白板作为一种强大的思维辅助工具，正在日益流行。为什么很多人喜欢白板呢？
为什么需要白板？

自由。白板没有过多的束缚。就像在一张白纸一样。你可以在空白页面随心所欲地表达你的思想。
可视化。只需要使用画笔、文本框等模块以及模版，快速地将你地思维过程和想法以图文组合地方式加以表达。

事实上，白板也并非什么新鲜事务。很多公司一直在使用实体白板进行开会等活动。如今，随着工作方式的改变，人们在远程工作、远程教育等场景中迫切需要电子白板工具。
那么，如何选择适合自己的电子白板软件呢？我根据对于白板软件的使用需求，依次介绍本地离线的白板软件、免费/好用的在线白板软件、在线协作的白板软件，以满足对白板软件从轻量级到重量级等不同程度的需求。此外，还介绍两种与白板相关、特殊类型的工具：介于白板和笔记之间的可视化知识管理工具、内置白板模块的笔记软件。
本地离线的白板软件
Microsoft Whiteboard 微软出品的免费白板软件
官网：Microsoft Whiteboard 官网

介绍：协作式数字画布，可实现有效会议和互动学习。
优点：微软出品，免费、强大。并且，可以与微软 Office 软件生态进行整合。
Apple Freeform 苹果正在开发的白板应用
Freeform 提供了一个“灵活的画布”，参与者可以在其中将文本、照片、绘图、PDF 和其他内容添加到单个空间中。该应用程序与 Messages 和 FaceTime 密切相关。Freeform 可以在 FaceTime 通话期间启动，并且通过 Messages 反映协作内容。具体发布时间未知，预计首先登录 iPadO…</span>

先给大家展示我去年的一个成果——《御赐小仵作》资料整理。大家可以看看下面这几张动图：

页面详情可点击此链接查看：《御赐小仵作》资料整理
《御赐小仵作》是去年的一部古装悬疑连续剧，算得上是暑期档的最大黑马了。该剧的情节、设定和诸多细节都很讲究，所以我觉得有必要整理一番。一来是出于自己对这部作品的喜爱，二来是想让制作团队的用心能让更多人看到。
去年6月的时候我开始整理，本以为只需要一两个星期，实则大大低估了它的工作量。我那会每天大概抽出半个小时，磨了整整5个月才完成。不过虽然是挺累的，但整理完还是倍有成就感。这次的整理大致分为5个模块：

每集的剧情脉络
剧中重要人物的介绍
相关的历史背景和知识
唐代的官职制度
剧中所涉及的知识点

这几部分主要是通过 wolai 的「双向链接」和「嵌入引用」来实现联动。
比如第一集的剧情这里，红色的部分是双向链接，引用的有人物也有知识点。跳转到人物界面之后，可以看到 ta 的简介，以及相关的经历。人物经历下面通过「嵌入引用」，把剧情里的信息链接过来。因为这部剧的主旋律是验尸和破案，所以几个主角的经历还会分出「工作成果」这一部分。

wolai 是国内开发的一个云端协作平台，用来搭建知识体系也很适合。
2018年的时候我就开始搭建自己的数据库，从最初的印象笔记，到后来的 Onenote 和 Notion，一步步探索，最后在2020年选择了 wolai。

掐指一算，试播集 已经暂别我们两个多月了，在没有南哥发车的这些日子里，我攒了不少读书笔记，决定自发的搞一期 “备播集”，大约等同于电视台里没节目可播的时候强行凑数的节目。

如果大家对这样的形式喜闻乐见，也欢迎在各种渠道找到我，大家一起攒读书笔记并发出来，希望能坚持到试播集回来的那一天。最后也感谢南哥对本文头图的大力支持。

@kokdemo 创业者们的自述
最近看到了巴塔哥尼亚创始人决定把公司“捐给地球1”的新闻，让我感到颇为震撼，在看完新闻之后，我立马去阅读了巴塔哥尼亚创始人伊冯·乔伊纳德所著的《冲浪板上的公司》这本书。
巴塔哥尼亚官网的公告-地球是我们唯一的股东
在读完这本书之后，我对这家公司的文化和理念十分敬佩，于是打算将这一段时间读过的一些公司创始人所写的书放在一起，和大家聊一聊。

《Salesforce传奇》：作者是 Salesforce 创始人马克·贝尼奥夫。Salesforce 是软件即服务行业（SaaS）的先驱和佼佼者，创办于1999年，主要产品是客户管理系统（CRM）；Salesforce 在纽约证券交易所上市，目前市值 1470.10 亿美元。

                              <span>在正式开始教程之前首先说明一下目前国行系统的状态：最新版三星云（5.2.00.5）屏蔽了OneDrive备份的入口，直接删除了相关备份软件的服务。因此要在国行系统机器上继续使用OneDrive备份需要降级三星云。如果对Samsung Pay没有需求而对同步有比较大的需求，最简单的方法是刷港版系统。本教程基于One UI 4.1，国行S20。所有需要的安装包均可在教程链接或者apkmirror网站上找到。
在开始之前需要的准备：一个非大陆地区的三星账号，一个微软账号（需要是个人账号），一个非国行系统的三星手机（也可以是你的国行设备刷港版系统），以及一部国行系统的三星手机（操作对象）。
第一步，绑定三星账号和微软账户。
在非国行系统的手机上登录三星账号，然后在相册的设置里，找到云同步，点击按照提示登录微软账户。其中某些步骤容易因为网络原因卡住，不过由于我从来没遇到过，所以有需求的建议在酷安上搜索相关资料，或者全程科学网络。这一步很简单，因此不做过多阐述。
第二步，降级三星云。
一般来说，国行系统的三星云会被强制自动更新，因此要想使用备份需要先降级三星云。
目前在apkmirror上找到能安装也能备份的最新版是5.1.00.13，由于版本号相比国行最新版三星云5.1.05.9更低，需要重新安装。可以现在系统里卸载三星云，再安装此版本的三星云。如果不想重新同步之前的云数据，可以使用ADB直接降级安装。代码我放在下面（为了方便输入，包名我改成了123.apk）
adb install -r -d D:\123.apk
第三步，在国行设备上进行后续操作。
登录账号之后，下载一个OneDrive，登录之前和三星账户绑定的那个微软账户。登录成功之后就可以暂时忽略这个软件。然后按照链接里的方法在手机上安装lycan，这一步是关键，否则之后的操作都无法进行。
https://www.coolapk.com/feed/32708070?shareKey&#x3D;YWUwNDI3ZTU5Y2FmNjMzMTVlN2M~&amp;shareUid&#x3D;964712&amp;shareFrom&#x3D;com.coolapk.app_5.0.2
下载「创建快捷方式」这个软件
【创建快捷方式】 ，打开之后右上角三个点勾选「也显示系统应用」，搜索三星云。点击进入三星云的活动列表，搜索「dashboard」，找到图中这个活动，然后创建一个快捷方式放在桌面。

如果此时打开这个快捷方式，会进入OneDrive同步的那个页面，但是会提示三星云需要更新才能同步，如果不更新就会强制退出。所以我们需要用到lycan屏蔽这个更新提示。
打开lycan，搜索三星云，在「服务」中将uploadtodrive两项设置成enable

在「接收器」中将下图三项禁用，三项名字均带有update

在「服务」中打开下图两项

此时重新打开刚刚那个快捷方式，就能够正常同步了。
成功效果如图

如果之后打开三星云又提示更新，可以按照之前的方法降级三星云。不排除之后的系统更新会屏蔽这个接口的可能，只能说且用且珍惜。</span>

                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">

                              <span>时间切片 Time Slice 是延时摄影的静态表现形式：你通过固定机位并在特定的时间间隔内拍摄一系列照片，得到一组静态照片，然后在后期的时候按照时间顺序，取每一张照片的局部，然后拼接起来，便得到一个名为时间切片的照片。
2022 年 7 月份在梧桐山顶拍摄了一组日落时分的延时照片，并在后期导入电脑并使用 DaVinci Resolve 合成延时视频的时候，我突然想起一个朋友在 2013 年输出的一个时间切片照片。于是也想给我这组照片制作一个时间切片。
后期制作时间切片是一道很复杂的工程（比如，可以参考这里），随着照片数目的增多，操作步骤会越多。在正式使用 Photoshop 尝试制作时间切片之前，我就直接有个想法，要不自己实现一把？
事实上，使用程序来实现一点都不难：给一组照片排好序后，在一个大的画布上，依次取该照片特定的区域，然后绘制到该画布的同样的区域就能实现这种效果。最开始我是在 Android 上进行这块的测试，后来很快就完成并验证了效果的可用性。后来想了下，MyerTidy 虽然目前的功能只有「整理文件」，但它实际上是可以定位为一个「批量处理」的 app。
最后便有了 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新（暂时只有 macOS 版本）。
此版本带来以下的变化：

重新设计的带响应式布局的首页，为未来支持更多批量操作进行前置的支持
新增各个模式的功能介绍以及效果图
支持「延时切片」功能，正如上文所说的，可以为你制作时间切片照片。在下文会做更详细的介绍
进行了小部分重构和性能优化

在首页选择了「延时切片」后，你便可以选择一个文件夹或者一组照片了，之后会自动进行预览渲染：

 
默认的效果是，根据你的文件名升序排序，从左到右，不对图片进行采样来进行绘制。
比如你有文件名为 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg 到 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg 的 100 张图片，会使用以下顺序从左到右来绘制：

绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg
绘制 TIMELAPSE_002.jpg
…
绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg

效果如上。
 
你可以点击「倒序处理」，来使用倒序的方式来从左到右绘制：

绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg
绘制 TIMELAPSE_099.jpg
…
绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg

效果如下：

 
如果你觉得你的图片太多了，想以固定的间隔来取一部分来绘制，那么可以在「跳过合成的数目」来输入你要跳过的数目 X。也就是，每隔 X 张，只会取一张来绘制。

跳过的数目为 5 的情况下，每 5 张会选择第一张来绘制。
对于上述图片，跳过数目设定为 50 的时候（原图片总数目为 654 张）效果如下：

 
最后，上述的布局方式都是「水平布局」：图片以水平方向来进行绘制。
你可以点击「垂直布局」，来开启从上到下的绘制模式，效果如下：

此外特别注意的一点是，MyerTidy 目前不支持图片自动对齐。因此如果你的图片组因为前期拍摄的原因有部分图片对不齐，那么需要你先使用 Photoshop 等工具来前期做对齐（当然，相比做时间切片来说，应该不算太困难）。如果需求强烈，那么可能会调研并加入这块的支持。
以上便是 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新。未来会专注 macOS 下对文件和图片的「批处理」的实现，目前期望会做的下一个大功能便是对文件按照特定的规则批量重命名（比如整理番剧之类的，会很有用），也在思考是否可以加入类似「星轨合成」这样的功能。
你可以通过 App Store 搜索 MyerTidy 来进行下载。如果你有什么想法和反馈，欢迎留言。</span>
