                              <span>The Laravel framework is an open-sourced PHP web framework that allows developers to create dynamic and scalable web applications. The source code of Laravel is hosted on GitHub and released under the MIT license.
Laravel helps you create applications with expressive, elegant syntax. The current Laravel version is 9.x. For all Laravel releases, bug fixes are provided for 18 months, and security fixes are provided for two years. Major framework releases are released yearly, while minor and patch releases may be released weekly.




Some of the features of Laravel are a modular packaging system with a dedicated dependency manager, different ways for accessing relational databases, utilities that aid in application deployment and maintenance, and its orientation toward syntactic sugar.

Rust is taking over the terminal. Rust is a general-purpose programming language that is blazing fast and memory safe. It is the fastest-growing and most loved programming language in the world. It is used to build everything from operating systems to web servers to command-line tools. Recently there has been a surge of command line tools and utilities written in Rust, and many of them are intended to replace standard Unix commands. They are faster, more user-friendly, and have more features than their standard Unix counterparts. In this post, I will cover some of the best Rust command line tools I have used for a while. You can also use these to supercharge your terminal.
These tools are available for both Linux and macOS. I have not tested them on Wind…</span>

With the recent economic downturn, investors are carefully scrutinizing companies&#x27; financials and growth potential. As a result, profitability has become more important than ever before.
And European tech funding data supports this statement:

When we do a quick recap of the graph, we can easily see that:
The investment amount in the third quarter of 2022 declined by 52% compared to the first quarter of the year
When it comes to comparing with the previous year&#x27;s Q3, the decline is 49%

Carousel, widely known as sliders, galleries, and slideshows, helps developers display text, graphics, images, and even video in one interactive, “sliding” block. They&#x27;re a great design option for grouping content and ideas together allowing you to form visual relationships between specific pieces of content.
Components in ReactJS are basically reusable and independent bits of code that render the HTML and data passed to it.
React has two component sides, the Function component, and the Class component.
Splide.js is lightweight, flexible, and accessible, it is a library that aids in building sliders however you want to design your slides without writing any CSS styles or codes.
In this tutorial, you will be learning how to build splide.js reusable carousel  components for re…</span>

                              <span>I always look at the Chrome updates to see what cool new features the team added.
Let&#x27;s take a look at them.
We first stumbled upon the new customized shortcuts in the DevTools option.
You can now open your DevTools and navigate to settings. There you&#x27;ll find &quot;Shortcuts&quot;.

You&#x27;ll also be able to adjust each shortcut to map to a different key if you prefer that.

It&#x27;s super convenient to adjust shortcuts to whatever works best for us.
Besides the option to modify any existing shortcuts, we get a new shortcut for toggling the preferred color scheme media query.

By default, the shortcut is empty. You can type and critical binding if you want to be active here.
Once you set something, you can use this shortcut to switch between the themes quickly.
What are some shortcuts you hope to see being added in the future?
I&#x27;m personally thrilled with the preferred color scheme and hope to see more rendering shortcuts being added as we go.

Devialet, the French audio company best known for its lineup of eye-catching audio gear that looks like Daft Punk helmets, is getting into the portable smart speaker business. Today, it’s announcing the Devialet Mania, a battery-powered speaker that retains the company’s signature sci-fi stylings but in a compact form factor that it says offers 10 hours of battery life at “moderate volumes.” 
The Mania includes four full-range drivers and two sub-woofers, which Devialet says offer 360-degree sound. But perhaps more interesting is how the speaker adjusts its sound profile based on measurements of your listening space it takes from its four microphones. Place the speaker up near a wall, for example, and Devialet claims the speaker’s two...

在埃隆·马斯克接管 Twitter 的一周内，Mastodon 激增了 23 万名用户，月活用户已达 65 万。但与 Twitter 相比，仍然非常少，Twitter 有将近 “2.38 亿日活用户”。其创始人说，“它显然没有 Twitter 那么大，但它是这个网络有史以来最大的。”Mastodon 出现于 2016 年，可以免费使用，也没有广告，由一个非营利组织开发的，并通过众筹获得支持。

Arc 显卡的更新只能在支持英特尔 ME 的系统进行

英特尔管理引擎（ME）是隐藏在英特尔 CPU 中的一个操作系统，它是一个修改版的 MINIX 3，运行在用户根本接触不到的 -3 层。这个事情我们以前 介绍 过。根据 Fwupd 开发者的消息，至少现在，英特尔的 Arc 显卡只能通过 ME 来更新其图形系统控制器的固件。因此，旧的英特尔系统或非英特尔系统，如 AMD、RISC-V 等系统，将无法更新 Arc 显卡的固件。

                              <span>你上次更新通过 Pip 安装的 Python 软件包是什么时候？大多数用户往往会忘记这些 Python 软件包也需要手动更新，因为仅仅更新系统存储库对于软件包来说是不起作用的。

因此，让我们花点时间看看如何使用 Pip，来更新旧的 Python 软件包吧。

如何使用 Pip 升级 Python 软件包

Pip（Pip Installs Packages） 是一个用于管理 Python 软件包的 命令行实用程序command line utility 。你可以将 Pip 安装 Python 软件包，类比为在 Ubuntu 和 Debian 中使用 apt 管理软件包那样。

因此，接下来就让我们深入了解如何使用这个极好的工具 Pip，来管理与 Python 软件包相关的内容吧。

1、列出过时的 Python 软件包

在计划更新什么软件包之前，我们先要列出有哪些过时的软件包，你可以在其中选择想要更新的软件包，因为大多数人不会想一下子更新整个软件包库。

要列出过时的 Python 软件包，你只需将 pip 命令与 list 选项、--outdated 标志一同使用即可，如下图所示：

pip list --outdated




2、升级特定的软件包

获得可更新的软件包列表后，你可以像我之前提到的那样，选择你要更新的那个特定的软件包，pip 升级软件包命令的语法如下：

pip install package_name -U


例如，我想将名为 anime-api 的软件包升级到最新版本，所以我将使用下面的命令来升级：

pip install anime-api -U




3、将软件包升级到特定的版本

没有必要总是使用软件的最新版本，如果你想将软件包升级到不是最新的某个特定版本，参考如下的命令语法：

pip install --upgrade 
&#x3D;&#x3D;


例如，我想将名为 xdg 的软件包更新到 5.1 版本，5.1 版本是最新版本的前一个版本，所以可以使用以下命令：

pip install --upgrade xdg&#x3D;&#x3D;5.1




4、使用 Pip 一次性升级所有软件包

请注意：我不建议你一次性升级所以软件包，因为 Python 软件包的依赖项太复杂了，一次性的升级无法处理相互依赖项。

要一次性升级所有 python 软件包，你可以使用以下命令：

pip3 list --outdated --format&#x3D;freeze | grep -v &#x27;^\-e&#x27; | cut -d &#x3D; -f 1 | xargs -n1 pip3 install -U




上面的命令使用了 xargs。首先，会得到所有需要更新的软件包，然后对每个软件包执行 pip3 install -U 命令。

我在这里使用的是 pip3，而不是 pip。在 Ubuntu 22.04 及更高的版本中，pip 和 pip3 命令都可以使用。

总结

使用 Pip 一次性更新所有 Python 软件包并不是一个好主意。我发现一次性更新后，软件包之间的依赖关系被破坏了，所以请确保只更新你想要更新的软件包。

如果你还有其他的疑问，就请在评论区中留言吧。

                              <span>想知道如何在台式机或笔记本电脑上检查 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 中的 CPU 和硬盘温度？这是一个快速指南。


如果你是普通用户，那么实际上不需要检查 CPU 或 HDD 温度。但是，如果你使用的是非常旧的硬件或轻薄型的硬件，你可能会遇到过热问题。因为这些薄的硬件内部紧密耦合在一起，无论做了多少传热机制，它都会升温。因此，必须监控硬件的温度。然而，现代 Linux 发行版能够通过软件传感器很好地处理过热情况。

在 Ubuntu 上监控 CPU 和硬盘温度的步骤

使用终端

我们将使用几个包来实现相同的目的。在基于 Ubuntu 的系统中打开一个终端并安装以下内容。

sudo apt install hddtemp
sudo apt install lm-sensors


hddtemp 程序为你提供硬盘和 SSD （根据我的测试）的温度。 lm-sensors 包为你提供来自 CPU 和其他通过 PCI 端口访问的传感器的温度详细信息。

安装后，从终端运行以下命令。你需要知道你的磁盘标识符，例如 /dev/sda 或 /dev/sdb 等。

要找出磁盘标识符，你可以使用 fdisk。

sudo fdisk -l


然后运行以下命令检查 HDD 或 SSD 温度。

sudo hddtemp




来自终端的 HDD 或 SSD 温度

检查 CPU 温度和其他信息需要额外的步骤。

首先，运行以下命令，以便传感器程序可以检测到系统中的传感器。

sudo sensors-detect


上面的命令可能会问你一些是/否的问题。继续按回车选择默认选项。

完成后，运行以下命令查看 CPU 和其他接口温度。

sensors




使用传感器

使用 GUI 工具

如果你更喜欢能完成上述所有操作的漂亮 GUI，你可以安装 psensor。该程序适用于 Linux 系统，例如 Ubuntu、Fedora、Arch 和其他变体。它为你提供了漂亮的图形和表格视图：

Ubuntu 及其衍生版：

sudo apt install psensor


Fedora 和基于 RPM 的衍生版：

sudo dnf install psensor


Arch、Manjaro 和类似的衍生版：

pacman -S psensor


安装后，从终端运行 psensor 或从应用菜单启动它。

正如你在下面的截图中所见，它通过漂亮的图表让你可以很好地了解 CPU、GPU 和 HDD 的所有重要温度。使用它的首选项，你可以根据需要对其进行调整。这个轻量级的程序在很多情况下都会很有帮助。



psensor 运行

因此，这些是你可以在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 系统中监控 CPU、GPU 或 HDD 温度的一些方法。如果你知道其他方法，请通过下面的评论栏告诉我。

💰 Aerospace Salaries:
A new section of the site allows aerospace professionals to share their salaries anonymously. The goal is to encourage transparency in this industry and help people negotiate their salaries. Already 500+ salary reports have been submitted and the average salary is $109k per year. You can also find more details about each report like the number of hours worked, years of experience, location, etc. Every salary is approved manually to be as accurate as possible.
https://rocketcrew.space/salaries

🎉 Small wins. The site now ranks 1st in the US for the &quot;space jobs&quot; keyword! And in October, I was able to make $1000 from Space companies looking to hire someone!

💪 I&#x27;m working to make Rocket Crew the go-to resource for someone wanting to work in this exciting industry, wish me luck haha!

Let me know if you have any questions!

🚀 Btw, I&#x27;m looking forward to the SLS launch and Starship orbital test flight!

So you want (or need) to figure out what &quot;open source&quot; really means. I&#x27;ll cover the basics of open source, whether you&#x27;re interested in contributing to a project or want to be in the loop at a new job where the term keeps getting thrown around.
Full disclosure: I am a person with little technical experience, working in the content-design fringes of a very technical open source environment. Given my background in marketing and communication, I felt like a fish out of water when I made this career switch. Git, data science, the ins and outs of software… It was, and still is a year later, a lot to comprehend.
But that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m writing this piece. I want to help make open source…</span>

Vely combines high performance and the low footprint of C with the ease of use and improved safety of languages like PHP. It&#x27;s free and open source software, licensed under GPLv3 and LGPL 3 for libraries, so you can even build commercial software with it.
Using Vely for SaaS
You can use Vely to create a multitenant web application that you can run on the Internet as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Each user has a completely separate data space from any other.
In this example web application, a user can sign up for a notebook service to create notes and then view and delete them. It demonstrates several technology integrations in just 310 lines of code across seven source files. The technologies incl…</span>

                              <span>如何让枯燥的读书像看剧、享受美食、打游戏一样快乐？
读书上瘾模型，让读书成为一个上瘾循环。

上学的时候我比较喜欢玩游戏，但是在图书馆有很好的学习看书的氛围，游戏玩得比较少。毕业后，不再有看书的氛围了，玩游戏的频率逐渐增加，从每周1天增加到2天、后来逐步增加到7天，每天都玩游戏。
那个时候我意识到已经游戏上瘾了，打游戏占据了太多的时间，所以决定戒掉游戏，经过几次尝试，终于在2020年把游戏戒掉了。

即从游戏上瘾转变为读书上瘾，读书包括输入和输出两个步骤。输入指的是看书，从去年开始在豆瓣记录读书情况，利用周末和工作日的被动等待时间，每个月最多读过11本书。
输出分为写、说、实践3种形式。

写，发表长篇博客或简短的书评。
说，分为线上和线下两种形式，线上指在各个自媒体平台发布读书视频；线下指面对面形式，1对1的交流沟通或1对多的分享。
实践，看书不应该只停留在改变认知的程度，还要实践、改变自己的行为习惯。比如看了一本关于运动的书，不仅要有每天都运动的认知，还要付诸于每天的实践行动。

上一次玩游戏是在2020年，接下来详细介绍如何从游戏上瘾转变为读书上瘾。

PBTFANS KABUKI-CHO 歌舞伎町
2022.4 
IC Base
这套键帽是由设计师OAY （罗马音？大概能翻译成哦呀，语气词）设计的第二套键帽，此前他还设计过pbtfans的深海来客，感兴趣的可以看我之前盘点的蓝色系键帽。
这套歌舞伎町键帽，灵感来源于日本的歌舞伎町——东京的娱乐中心之一。电影院、电玩舞厅、酒吧等等，从深夜到黎明，也是为数不多的大型红灯区，我对于歌舞伎町最深刻的印象则是来自于《银魂》中主角团所居住的歌舞伎町一条街。
配色：

这次的配色非常丰富，主要还是由于个性部分选用多种不同色彩。键帽整体底色以深蓝暗色调为主，而字符和个性选用明亮的色调，如同霓虹灯招牌的颜色，侧面烘托出歌舞伎町“不眠之街”的名号，到深夜依然灯火通明、灯红酒绿。
个性部分：
大货版本
这次的现货销售是直接将个性和base进行了捆绑，还包含了四个颜色的盖帽。
个性部分主要由歌舞伎、酒精和没事组成，以及歌舞伎町的招牌和著名的“一丁目”。颜色上也是选择非常丰富，盖帽倒是提供了一种略微复古但俏皮的感觉，七字回车则是意味着现代的电力为这般灯红酒绿提供了便利。
搭配展示：
该键帽已经开售有一段时间，所以已经有玩家提供了实拍的照片，有这些实物图，能更好的帮助我们来判断是否购入。

键帽信息：
材质：PBT材质
高度：原厂高度
工艺：二色工艺
厂商：PBTFANS
淘宝有售卖，据悉歌舞伎町卖的很好，货量有限，kbd自己的店铺已经卖完了，经销商仍有现货。 
个人评分:7-8（深色键帽非常耐看，歌舞伎町的主题也很新鲜，个性颜色丰富,PBTFANS代工水平不错）
购买建议：喜欢这个主题的值得入手，现货也无需等待

Elon Musk’s Twitter has a new rule for everyone with an account on Twitter to follow, as he announced from his own account: “any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying ‘parody’ will be permanently suspended.” In a follow-up tweet, Musk said “Previously, we issued a warning before suspension, but now that we are rolling out widespread verification, there will be no warning.”
Going forward, any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying “parody” will be permanently suspended

Apple says to expect “longer wait times” if you plan on ordering an iPhone 14 Pro or 14 Pro Max. In a press release, the company explains that covid restrictions are affecting its iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, China, which is currently “operating at significantly reduced capacity.”
“We continue to see strong demand for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max models,” Apple says. “However, we now expect lower iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max shipments than we previously anticipated and customers will experience longer wait times to receive their new products.”
In October, a report from Reuters revealed that iPhone production could slump by at least 30 percent due to the strict covid restrictions affecting Foxconn, the China-based factory...

Meta’s planning major job cuts that could affect “thousands” of workers, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. Sources familiar with the situation told the WSJ that the layoffs could begin as soon as Wednesday.
The Facebook and Instagram parent company reported over 87,000 employees at the end of September, but these “large-scale” layoffs are expected to slash a significant portion of staff members. According to the WSJ, the layoffs could hit Meta even harder than the mass job cuts at Twitter, which affected about half of the company’s 7,500-employee workforce. 
In June, Meta’s chief product officer Chris Cox warned employees of “serious times,” noting that employees must “execute flawlessly in an environment of slower...

Twitter’s pushing back the launch of its new Blue subscription with verification until after this week’s midterm elections, according to a report from The New York Times. According to an internal memo viewed by the outlet, a manager working on the project said they’ve “made the decision to move the launch of this release to Nov. 9, after the election.”
Elon Musk, Twitter’s new owner, announced the new $7.99 per month Twitter Blue earlier this month with perks like fewer ads, search priority, the ability to post longer videos, and the ability to pay your way to verification. Under Musk’s new rules, anyone can get a verified checkmark if they pay for Blue, sparking concern over whether users will be able to tell real accounts from fake...

After Apple issued several copyright claims, YouTube took down an archival channel containing hundreds of decades-old videos from past Apple Worldwide Developer Conferences (WWDC). Brendan Shanks, the owner of the Apple WWDC Videos channel, says his account’s been permanently disabled after receiving well over three copyright strikes — the maximum number of violations you can incur before YouTube removes your account.
In screenshots of emails shared by Shanks, Apple issued a number of takedown requests against his videos, some of which dated back to the early 2000s. Shanks says he still has all the original video files and descriptions, and is currently trying to get the content over to the Internet Archive. Apple didn’t immediately...

Apple’s looking to change Siri’s trigger phrase from “Hey Siri,” to just “Siri,” according to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. This means you would just need to say “Siri” followed by a command to activate the smart assistant.
As noted by Gurman, Apple’s been working on this feature for the past several months and is expected to roll it out next year or in 2024. But Apple will have to put in a “significant amount of AI training and underlying engineering work,” to get the feature to function properly, as the smart assistant will need to understand the single wake word in multiple accents and dialects. The current, two-word trigger phrase, “Hey Siri,” increases the chance of Siri picking up on it.

                              <span>在安卓手机的宣传稿中，我们经常能听到厂商宣传其所搭载的图像传感器型号，例如索尼 IMX***、三星 S5K***、豪威 OV****。但是在 iPhone 的宣传中，我们就不曾听过苹果声明 iPhone 使用的图像传感器型号，一般都是使用「传感器面积增大了 **」、「像素更大更深」、「全新的高速传感器」之类的比较模糊的用词，所以对于历代 iPhone 具体使用何种传感器，互联网上有诸多不能明确的信息。此文意在将我自己搜集到的相关信息进行梳理，试图考证它们的可靠性，为之后写作 iPhone 图像传感器进化打下基础。

首先给出我整理后的部分信息。（欢迎各位指正）
太不巧整理，截自我的 Notion 页面
一、主要参考信源
互联网上关于 iPhone 图像传感器的信息参差不齐，大部分信息都没有给出出处，单纯引用某一信源难以有说服力，我综合了部分我比较认可的信源，各位可以自行甄别。
维基百科/Exmor
Exmor 是索尼公司应用在其部分 CMOS 图像传感器上的技术名称。维基百科上的 Exmor 词条收集整理了大量索尼 Exmor 图像传感器及其使用的机型，使用 Ctrl+F 可快速搜索 iPhone 关键词。我将其整理如下表。

                              <span>写在最前面，CFE卡贵谁都知道，但是这玩意性能是真的强，不管你现在用不用得着，都建议你收藏一下，虽然现在买不起，但是梦想还是要有的嘛！
CFE-A卡是索尼从A7S3开始使用的新一代高速存储设备，以应对越来越大的视频录制码率。早先使用CFE-A卡的机型都比较贵（A7S3,FX3,A1等），受众并不多。但从A7M4的大卖和FX30的发布，越来越多的用户开始使用支持CFE-A卡的相机，如何选购一张合适的CFE-A卡就成了许多用户头疼的问题。
懂数码的都知道，索尼虽然“爱好广泛”，但唯独没有生产研发存储产品的业务，也就是说索尼的卡都是其他厂家代工的贴牌产品，理论上是不可能干得过拥有独立生产研发存储颗粒的品牌的，所谓的索尼大法黑科技在存储领域也仅仅是索尼粉丝自己加上的滤镜而已。
由于CFE-A卡是索尼独占的新卡型，在发布之初的相当长一段时间里都只有索尼原厂的卡可以选择，因为缺少比较的竞品，让许多人养成了原厂&#x3D;最好的固有印象。
如今第三方的CFE-A品牌越来越多，索尼原厂卡到底是个什么水平，终于可以有一个正经的横向比较了。
市面上可以做CFE-A卡的品牌有索尼，雷克沙，天硕，和至誉科技四家，笔者手里正好分别有一张拿来比较测试，他们是

索尼原厂的80G，官方售价699;
分别是雷克沙的320G，官方售价5599带读卡器;
天硕的80G，官方售价399；
至誉科技的120G，官方售价1599;

少数派不让带货就不放链接了。

之所以价格区间跨度很大，从几百到几千，主要是为了照顾不同经济实力的用户。
测试采用的读卡器是雷克沙的RW530，是一个CFA和SD卡双卡槽的读卡器，采用USB 3.2gen2接口，两个卡槽可以同时工作，可以实现互拷的功能。

一、性能对比
1、索尼80G

首先出场的是原厂的80G，由于这张卡是在套机里一起售卖的，拆机卡很多，只要六七百。买的人很多，不过大多数都舍…</span>

                              <span>GitHub Copilot 被诉“规模空前的软件盗版”

周四，有程序员在旧金山提起诉讼，称其代表数百万可能受每月 10 美元的 Copilot 服务影响的 GitHub 用户。该诉讼旨在挑战 GitHub Copilot 的合法性。诉讼对象包括 GitHub 其所有者微软，以及为该工具提供支持的 OpenAI。该诉讼认为“被告已经侵犯了大量创作者的合法权利，这些创作者在 GitHub 上根据某些开源许可证发布代码或其他作品。”包括 MIT 许可证、GPL 许可证和 Apache 许可证等 11 个流行的开源许可证，都要求注明作者姓名和版权。Copilot 违反并删除这些许可证，“因此，它正在实施规模空前的软件盗版行为。”

老王点评：虽然可能是旷日持久的诉讼，但是目前的 AI 没有理会开源许可证就直接拿过来用代码的方式，肯定是有问题的。




经过六年等待，Rust 终于支持通用关联类型了

最新的 Rust 稳定版 1.65.0 支持了通用关联类型（GAT），可以在关联类型上声明生命期、类型和常量泛型。Rust 官方称，“很难用几个字来形容这些东西有多有用。”为了支持 GAT，必须对编译器进行大量的修改，而这项功能的 RFC 是 2016 年提出的。总的来说，GAT 为大量的模式和 API 提供了基础性的依据。大量项目因为 GAT 的稳定而受阻。即使你不需要直接使用 GAT，你所使用的库也很有可能在内部或公开场合使用它，很多时候，GAT 是唯一实现方式。

老王点评：Rust 越来越发展完善，真的可以预期成为主要的底层语言。




谷歌计划建立支持世界上 1000 种最常用的语言的 AI 模型

该公司公布了一个经过 400 多种语言训练的 AI 模型，它将其描述为 “目前在语音模型中看到的最大的语言覆盖范围”，并宣布建立一个支持 1000 种语言的模型。谷歌认为，创建一个如此规模的模型将使其更容易将各种人工智能功能带入在线空间和人工智能训练数据集中表现不佳的语言（也被称为 “低资源语言”）。谷歌称，建立单一模型，而不是建立 1000 种不同的模型，有助于 AI 将从高资源语言获得的能力转化为低资源语言的能力。

                              <span>安卓的一个重要进展是将安卓开源项目Android Open Source Project（AOSP）移植到 RISC-V 处理器架构。




AOSP 已经开始在上游启用 RISC-V，这将促进 RISC-V CPU 在可穿戴设备、物联网，以及最终在智能手机和笔记本电脑中的使用。

为了开放生态系统，中国科学院 PLCT 实验室的工程师和软件开发人员在 2020 年开始将 Android 10 移植到 RISC-V 架构上。阿里巴巴的云计算部门和平头哥芯片子公司一起努力保持开发与最新的安卓版本同步。

“我们很高兴看到谷歌对构建针对 RISC-V 的 AOSP 的更多支持！阿里云一直致力于通过一系列的创新来支持 RISC-V 社区的发展，比如将安卓的基本功能移植到 RISC-V 上，这证明了在从多媒体到信号处理、设备互联和人工智能等场景中使用基于 RISC-V 的设备的可行性。”阿里云生态系统总监、RISC-V 国际组织的应用与工具水平委员会副主席 David Chen 博士说：“我们期待着与安卓团队合作，为繁荣的 RISC-V 社区做出贡献。”

通过增强 RISC-V 上的安卓系统的基本功能，在 2021 年，阿里云的专家们付出了巨大的努力，积极推动了软件生态系统的发展。 RISC-V on Android 的工作集中在 RISC-V Android 工作组和软件库中进行。

                              <span>git log 命令是 Git 中一个很重要的查看提交记录的工具，它也是人们喜欢使用 Git 的原因之一。


git log 命令能够让你了解到更多关于贡献者 提交commit 的记录。使用 git log 的一种方式是按日期查看提交记录 。要查看在指定日期或日期范围内创建的 Git 存储库中的提交记录，请使用带有选项 --since 或 --until 或者同时使用以上两个选项的 git log 命令。

首先，进入你要查看的分支（例如，main 分支）：

$ git checkout main


接下来，你可以使用以下命令，来显示当前日期（即今天）的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since&#x3D;&quot;yesterday&quot;


仅显示某一特定用户（例如，用户 Agil）在今天的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since&#x3D;&quot;yesterday&quot; --author&#x3D;&quot;Agil&quot;


还可以显示在某一日期范围内的提交记录。使用以下命令，显示在任意两个日期之间（例如，2022 年 4 月 22 日至 2022 年 4 月 24 日）的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since&#x3D;&quot;2022-04-22&quot; --until&#x3D;&quot;2022-04-24&quot;


在上面这个例子中，会输出 2022 年 4 月 22 日至 2022 年 4 月 24 日期间，不包括 2022 年 4 月 22 日的所有提交记录。如果你想要包括 2022 年 4 月 22 日的提交记录，请将命令中的 2022-04-22 替换为 2022-04-21。

运行以下命令，能够显示某一特定用户（例如，用户 Agil）在两个指定的日期之间的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since&#x3D;&quot;2022-04-22&quot; --until&#x3D;&quot;2022-04-24&quot; --author&#x3D;&quot;Agil&quot;


总结

Git 有很多优点，其中一个优点就是 Git 让你能够收集你项目的相关数据。git log 命令是一个重要的查看提交记录的工具，也是人们喜欢使用 Git 的原因之一！

                              <span>这个带有脚本的快速指南有助于清理旧的 Snap 版本并释放 Ubuntu 系统中的一些磁盘空间。


我正在使用的 Ubuntu 测试系统中的磁盘空间不足。因此，我通过 GNOME 的磁盘使用分析器进行调查，以找出哪个包正在消耗宝贵的 SSD 空间。除了通常的缓存和主目录，令我惊讶的是，我发现 Snap 和 Flatpak 消耗了大量的存储空间。



尽管如此，我始终坚持一个规则：除非必要，否则不要使用 Snap 或 Flatpak。这主要是因为它们的安装尺寸和其他问题。我更喜欢原生 deb 和 rpm 包。多年来，我在这个测试系统中安装和移除了一定数量的 Snap 包。

但卸载后还有问题。Snap 在系统中保留了一些残留文件，一般用户不知道。

所以我打开了 Snap 文件夹 /var/lib/snapd/snaps，发现 Snap 保留了以前安装/卸载的软件包的旧版本。

例如，在下图中，你可以看到 GNOME 3.28、3.34 和 Wine 都被删除了。但它们还在那里。发生这种情况是因为 Snap 的设计，它在正确卸载后保留已卸载软件包的版本。



或者，你可以在终端中使用：

snap list --all




对于保留的版本，默认值为 3。这意味着 Snap 会保留每个软件包的三个旧版本，包括活动版本。如果你对磁盘空间没有限制，这是可以的。

但是对于服务器和其他情况，这很容易遇到成本问题，它会消耗你的磁盘空间。

但是，你可以使用以下命令轻松修改计数。该值可以在 2 到 20 之间。

sudo snap set system refresh.retain&#x3D;2


清理 Snap 版本

在 SuperUser 的一篇文章中，Canonical 的前工程经理 Popey 提供了一个简单的脚本，它可以清理旧版本的 Snaps 并保留最新版本。

这是我们将用来清理 Snap 的脚本。

#!/bin/bash
#Removes old revisions of snaps
#CLOSE ALL SNAPS BEFORE RUNNING THIS
set -eu
LANG&#x3D;en_US.UTF-8 snap list --all | awk &#x27;/disabled/{print $1, $3}&#x27; |
while read snapname revision; do
    snap remove &quot;$snapname&quot; --revision&#x3D;&quot;$revision&quot;
done


将上面的脚本以 .sh 扩展名保存在一个目录中（例如 clean_snap.sh），赋予它可执行权限并运行。

chmod +x clean_snap.sh


当我运行脚本后，它减少了很多磁盘空间。该脚本还将显示要删除的包的名称。





结束语

对于 Snap 的设计效率如何，人们总是争论不休。许多人说，它的设计是坏的，是臃肿的，是消耗系统资源的。这种说法的某些部分是真实的，我不会否认它。如果实施和加强得当，整个沙盒应用的概念是很好的。但我相信，与 Snap 相比，Flatpak 工作做得更好。

也就是说，我希望这可以帮助你清理一些磁盘空间。尽管它只在 Ubuntu 中进行了测试，但它应该适用于所有支持 Snap 的 Linux 发行版。

此外，请查看我们关于 如何清理 Ubuntu 的指南以及其他步骤。

最后，如果你要清理 Flatpak 应用，请参阅 这篇指南。

                              <span>Crisp widget  💬💙

Since 2015, we&#x27;ve always worked hard to bring the best website chat experience for our customers around the world.

Today marks a new era at Crisp as our widget has been totally rebuilt to offer a brand-new website experience.

This new widget doesn&#x27;t only pave the way for a better conversational experience, but also establishes Crisp as an all-in-one multichannel support tool for brands around the world.

Our next-generation website widget is powered by VueJS, allowing for unprecedented website performance and lightweightness.

No more small talk, here is what&#x27;s new and how you can benefit from it:

- Make communication asynchronous by pushing help articles before getting conversational 📚
- Craft social commerce experiences right from your website or on any channel (WhatsApp, Instagram, or Messenger are supported) 💰
- Get customer satisfaction score from the chat or on any channel ⭐️

And it is just getting started but so we&#x27;re really excited to hear your feedback.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

                              <span>作为一名iPhone用户，快捷指令是系统中我觉得很有趣但实际上用得不是很多的应用。
最初对快捷指令的理解仅限于将多个操作步骤简化成一个，最直观的应用就是在功能日益繁杂的APP中实现功能的一键直达，比如疫情期间的健康码。
但深入探究一番后，我认为快捷指令的本质其实是打破各个APP沙盒的壁垒，实现不同应用程序的能力互通，提升个人的自动化水平。
但事情情况并不尽如人意，虽然快捷指令编辑器提供了足够强大的编辑器，但三方应用对其支持并不好，大多数APP还是尽可能期望把用户圈在自己的生态中，没有开放足够的能力出来，这也是一款生态级应用的无奈。
想象中的快捷指令
现在应用商店的APP已经足够多，可以帮助人们解决足够多的问题，但有时候一款应用并不能完全解决某项任务，需要多个应用配合操作，如果用户可以随意调用应用中功能并组合成自己所需要完成特定任务的能力，那么用户体验和效率都将提升到新的高度。
想象一种场景，当我在观看自己感兴趣的外语视频时，因为语言的障碍可能不能足够理解视频内容，我需要一些辅助支持：我希望翻译软件能够帮我把外语翻译成母语，甚至希望语音合成软件将翻译后的语言读出来。孤立地看这个场景中的每个需求，都有应用能很好得实现：视频网站能够提供我感兴趣的内容，翻译软件能将语言进行较高准确度的翻译，语音合成软件能够将文字朗读出来。但是当这三个需求点分布在三个不同的APP时，用户就难以较高效率完成这个场景的任务。实际上每个APP的能力都被封锁在了自己APP里面。

上面说的这个场景我自己就有，但是因为没能使用现有工具很好使用，只得自己动手做了一个插件，可以朗读B站上面带有字幕的视频，因为微软的中文语音合成做得比较好，所以先放在Edge浏览器上了，目前还只支持带外挂字幕的视频，大家感兴趣也可以使用。

现实中的快捷指令
虽然当前快捷指令还不够优秀，但对于日常效率的提升还是有一定帮助的，特别是对于实现与苹果自带应用的互通。
举个使用的例子，每天早上我会用笔记软件记录一下昨日回顾、思考以及今日的计划，对于今日计划，我希望用待办应用去跟踪计划中事项的状态，但是手动把写过的东西在另一个APP里面再写一遍实在是太过愚蠢，于是我就写了快捷指令去实现。

实际使用中，只要选择对应的文本并在共享表单中点击对应的操作就可以同步到系统自带的提醒事项中，在mac上还可以添加快捷键一键实现（应该还可以通过「自动化」省去手动操作这一步）。
当前的快捷指令有三个亮点：

在快捷指令的编辑上采用图形化拖拽操作，相对于写脚本，这种操作显得更加友好，并且也可以支持自定义脚本的加入，甚至让我一度觉得学编程的第一个应用是用快捷指令写得；
在快捷指令的运行上打通了Siri、小组件以及共享操作，特别是后者，为与三方应用的结合提供了基础的平台；
加入了自动化功能，可以根据一定的规则直接省去了用户主动调用快捷指令这一步。

但要让更多的人在更多场景下使用快捷指令，还有着一些明显的不足：

上手使用上有一些门槛，官方没有详细的教程，虽然提供了一些案例，但是大多数人应该没有耐心仔细去看快捷中心中那些精选的指令是如何实现的，这点Mac上快捷指令前辈「自动操作」可能给点其启示，其中「录制」功能可以通过「我做给你看」自动识别操作中的事件；
快捷指令的分发做得还不够，既然不是每个人都能轻松使用快捷指令，那么获取现成的快捷指令则更加重要，但快捷指令中心中精选的指令本土化、个性化做得并不好，我觉得如果能根据用户所安装的APP来个性化分发常用的快捷指令会更友好；
三方应用的能力开放明显不足，大多数的使用场景还是围绕在苹果自带应用提供的能力，这点极大限制了快捷指令的应用场景；
使用Siri来激活快捷指令时对于指令的识别非常差，官方有说使用快捷指令的名称就可以通过Siri调用，但实际使用时不时语音识别不出来就是调用的指令不正确；

有趣的是，在WWDC2022中，我们看到苹果开始推广App Intent框架，通过为应用开发者提供更多系统级的入口曝光来吸引他们将其应用所能满足的用户意图曝光给系统，从而使得系统可以通过学习用户行为实现跨应用的能力整合。
结语
很多人即使生活中充满重复的事情也不会去探索提高效率方式，因为对比眼前简单的操作，去探究增进效率操作的所花费的学习努力带来的成本更加高，只是把时间线拉得足够远，才能看见效率提升所带来收益。
自动化所存在的意义是帮助人完成任务并节省时间，虽然我们每个人都已经拥有足够多的计算设备，但我们并没有充分发挥其拥有的算力，个人的自动化仍是一个尚待开发的领域。
期待未来的快捷指令能为个人的自动化增添更多的可能性。</span>

一位工程师用两台不带显示器的 Commodore 64 “古代”电脑作为键盘，用五寸软盘粘在一起作为风箱，制作了一台可以演奏的手风琴。这个项目采用了大量定制的软件和硬件黑科技。通过测量风箱挤压时通过的空气噪音并转换为信号。Commodore 电脑本身没有音频设备，音频信号是通过插孔输出发声的。Commodore 64 是有史以来最畅销的电脑，于 1982 年开始生产。

Web 之父说 Web3 根本不是互联网

发明 Web 的蒂姆·伯纳斯-李在里斯本周五举行的 Web 峰会上表示，“真正的 Web3 的名字被以太坊的人拿去做区块链的东西，这真是一个耻辱。事实上，Web3 根本就不是 Web。”Web3 是科技界的一个模糊的术语，用来描述一个假设的未来版本的互联网，它比今天更去中心化，而不被各大巨头所支配。他认为需要澄清 Web 3 和 Web 3.0，并开发了自己的 Web 3.0 项目 Solid。

老王点评：名词并不重要，重要的真正有用，依我看，Solid 也是空中楼阁，未必比以太坊等 Web 3 项目有希望。

但是，在 Ventoy 出道之前，WoeUSB 是用于创建可启动 Windows USB 的首选工具。原版 WoeUSB 工程在 2014 年左右香消玉损。

鉴于其流行程度，一位新的开发者接过了将其起死回生的任务。因此，WoeUSB-ng 诞生了。在这里，“ng” 是 新生代new generation 的缩写。换句话说，WoeUSB-ng 是新生代的 WoeUSB 。但是，因为原版的工具已经不存在了，我将 WoeUSB-ng 描述为 WoeUSB 。

在这篇教程中，我将向你展示如何在 Ubuntu Linux 上安装 WoeUSB 。我也将分享使用 WoeUSB 来创建可启动 Windows USB 的步骤。

但是，在此之前，让我们快速查看这个令人惊叹的工具的特色。

WoeUSB



WoeUSB 是一个简单的工具，其唯一的目的是 在 Linux 上创建可启动 Windows USB 。

原版 WoeUSB 是一个 shell 脚本。这个原版 WoeUSB 被使用 Python 重写为 WoeUSB-ng ，它可以安装在你的系统上，并且通过命令行或 GUI 界面。

特色：


支持老式 PC 启动或 UEFI 启动

支持 FAT32 和 NTFS 文件系统

支持使用物理安装盘或磁盘镜像作为源

它可以用于 Windows Vista 及其更高版本的任意语言或变体版本

老式的 MBR/IBM PC 兼容启动模式

本机 UEFI 启动支持 Windows 7 及其更高版本的镜像（仅限于将 FAT 文件系统作为目标的情况）


在 Ubuntu 和其它的 Linux 发行版上安装 WoeUSB

                              <span>以下是快速检查在运行 Xorg 还是 Wayland 显示服务器的方法。


随着时间的推移，现代 Wayland 显示服务器正在进入所有 Linux 发行版。尽管老旧的 Xorg 仍然能用并且会继续存在，但 Wayland 无疑在安全性和其他性能方面更好。

但是，Xorg 不会很快完全淘汰。可能永远不会。

如果你在运行任何 Linux 发行版，如何检查运行的是 Xorg 还是 Wayland？下面是方法。

Wayland 或 Xorg：你在运行哪一个？

在你的 Linux 发行版（例如 Ubuntu、Fedora、Arch 等）中打开一个终端窗口（CTRL+ALT+T）。

然后输入以下命令并回车：

echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE


命令输出会告诉你当前会话是 Wayland 还是 Xorg（X11）。

[debugpoint@fedora ~]$ echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPEwayland




这很简单。但是，还有其他方法。

其他方法

使用设置

如果你需要图形方法，请打开你的 Linux 发行版的设置应用。在关于部分，你应该看到某个标签下中的 Wayland/X11。

例如，在 GNOME 设置中，你可以在 “窗口子系统Windowing system” 下找到它，如下图所示：



使用会话值

你还可以使用 systemd 登录管理器 loginctl 找到它。请记住，它仅适用于基于 systemd 的系统。

打开终端并运行以下命令。你可以看到会话 id 值。在此示例中为 c2：

loginctl


现在，将会话 ID 传递给以下命令以获取显示服务器类型。确保将 c2 更改为你的系统规格。

loginctl show-session c2 -p Type




总结

这些是你可以确定在 Linux 系统中运行的是 Systemd 还是 Xorg 的一些方法。你还可以在 shell 脚本中使用上述命令来实现进一步的流程自动化。

祝好。

                              <span>我向所有的 Linux 初学者推荐以下这些命令。




在使用 Linux 命令行时，很容易就会迷失方向，这可能会导致灾难性的后果：我有一次使用删除命令 rm 删除文件，然而删除之后我才意识到我刚刚是删除了计算机的引导目录。后来，我学会了使用 pwd 命令，来知道当前在文件系统的哪个目录下；并且我使用了 trashy 和 trash-cli 这一命令行回收站工具（LCTT 译注：在删除文件时 trash-cli 会充当中间人，将文件先“删除”到桌面上的垃圾箱中，能够通过垃圾箱或通过终端的 trash 命令，来恢复垃圾箱中已删除的文件。）

当我刚开始使用 Linux 时，我有一个放在桌子上的“速查表”，它就是《101 条你应该知道的 Linux 命令》，我在管理 Linux 服务器时能参考速查表上面的这些命令。随着我越来越熟悉这些命令，我越来越精通服务器管理了。

以下是我认为最有用的 12 个 Linux 命令。

1、打印工作目录（pwd）

pwd 命令会打印出你的工作目录。换句话来说，它输出你当前所在目录的路径。pwd 命令有两种选项：-L 或 --logical（即逻辑路径）用来打印当前的目录路径（不解析符号链接），-P 或 --physial（即物理路径）会打印出解析符号链接后的物理目录。（LCTT 译注：你可以进一步阅读我们翻译的 另一篇文章。）

2、创建目录（mkdir）

使用 mkdir 命令来创建一个新目录，是非常容易的。以下命令，创建了一个名为 example 目录（若 example 已存在，则无法创建）：

$ mkdir example


你也可以在嵌套地创建目录及其子目录：

$ mkdir -p example/one/two


如果目录 example 和目录 one 都已存在，则仅会创建目录 two…</span>

Years ago while rummaging through the contents of a shelf in a used bookstore, I happened upon a booklet titled &quot;UNIX System Command Summary for Berkeley 4.2 &amp; 4.3 BSD,&quot; published by Specialized Systems Consultants. I bought it as a curiosity item because it was nearly 20 years old yet still largely applicable to modern Linux and BSD.
That amused me then and now. A booklet written in 1986 was still largely relevant in 2016, while books on the same shelf about a proprietary OS weren&#x27;t worth the paper they were printed on. (Think about it: What technology do you think is going to survive a zombie apocalypse?) I&#x27;ve had the booklet on my own bookshelf for several years now, but it occurred to me that it&#x27;s pro…</span>

                              <span>记账是我坚持得最久的习惯，到如今已经快4年。
期间有中断过，怀疑过，也尝试过很多不同的工具，发现用对工具的确轻松很多，也更容易坚持。今天就来跟大家分享下我记账这些年的心路历程，希望能帮到正在犹豫记账的你。
我会先讲下我是如何坚持记账，以及记账对我的改变，最后再分享记账应用（附带视频），只想看评测的话可以直接跳到最后哦。
一、如何开始记账
我之所以开始记账，也是因为发现自己每个月钱都不知花哪去了，所以想通过记账来了解自己的收支情况，让自己对生活掌控得更好。
一开始是消费一单就记一次，但太繁琐了，经常会忘记。所以就改成了每天固定睡前记账。但这样，依旧老是忘记，于是我设置了每晚10点的定时闹钟，效果就好很多了。等到养成习惯后，就再也不用设置闹钟了，以后一到那个点，脑子就自动提醒我记账，偶有遗忘，但也慢慢坚持下来了。而且因为我用打卡app，所以如果没记账，那天的记录就会为空，出于强迫症的原因，我也一定会把缺的那天补上。就这么不知不觉坚持了快4年。
但其实，我这种每一笔都记的方式还是比较费劲的，不一定适合所有人，我这里推荐两个降低难度的方式：

别全部都都记，这样太琐碎，而是设置一个额度，高于该额度的支出才记。
是充分利用记账应用，选择有自动同步账单功能，或者支持语音输入的记账应用，下面有推荐类似的App。

二、对记账的反思
那我这样记账4年下来的结果如何呢？
一方面，我的确因此免去了许多不必要的开支，存住了钱，对比起身边一些朋友，有储蓄更踏实，还可以把闲钱拿出来投资理财。
但另一方面，我也明显感觉自己似乎有点 落伍了......当同龄人在炫耀新买的电子产品、潮牌、口红包包时，当别人用钱堆出来一个时髦大方的形象时，其实很难不羡慕。可是让我去购买一些非必需品，这带来的罪恶感，又远大于我得到它的满足感。

是的，记账的习惯，让我的消费习惯变成了——只买有用的东西。

瑞典时间 10 月 4 日上午，诺贝尔奖委员会宣布 2022 年诺贝尔物理学奖授予阿兰·阿斯佩克特 (Alain Aspect)、约翰·克劳瑟 (John F. Clauser) 和安东·泽林格 (Anton Zeilinger)，以表彰他们 「进行了纠缠光子的实验，确立了对贝尔不等式的不成立并开创了量子信息科学」。阿兰·阿斯佩克特、约翰·克劳瑟和安东·泽林格分别利用处于相互纠缠的量子态进行了突破性的实验。在这种情况下，两个粒子即使被分开也表现得如同一个整体。他们的成果为基于量子信息的新技术扫清了道路。
—— 摘自诺贝尔物理学奖官方新闻稿

说实话，在诺贝尔奖委员会正式宣布量子纠缠相关的成果获奖后，我立刻就意识到，互联网上很快就会充斥着各种针对量子纠缠以及量子世界的神秘性相关的科普。这些科普，无论是原创的还是东拼西凑的，无论是专家学者起草的还是各路内容流水线上生产的，都有一个共同的特征：它们往往都喜欢强化量子物理的神秘性和不可理解。
我承认，历史上确实有这么一段时间，即使是 20 世纪初期那些鼎鼎大名的物理学家，都曾为量子相关的物理现象感到困惑。然而，经过一百多年的发展，量子物理的诸多核心概念早就被一代又一代的物理学家里里外外地玩了个遍，以至于许多被科普作家渲染得神乎其神的概念，现正躺在物理系本科生的必修课教材里。
当然，量子力学有它反直觉的地方。但是，现实生活中反直觉的事情还少吗？反直觉并不意味着神秘或不可理解。它只是需要你屏蔽你的许多生活常识，用绝对的理性来思考问题。所以，这篇文章会和你读过的绝大部分科普不同，我不会把量子…</span>

                              <span>引言：用惯旗舰的我，为啥突然自购了一台入门DAP？

我承认，这个标题有点蹭过时热搜的标题党嫌疑；但作为一个有着五六年HiFi设备购买经验、分享却极其佛系的用户，收获不能说是经验丰富吧，至少也能说是白忙一场；自从三年以前第一次入手了旗舰级的KANN CUBE之后，为了追求“好马配好鞍”，在便携领域各种入手搭配的旗舰耳塞线材套装，洒出去的钱也有个五位数往上了。虽然标题上写着是对节奏坦克新款播放器V6的体验，但从某种程度上来说，这篇文章也算是玩了这么久的HiFi设备之后，一篇简单的自我回顾和反思文章。
在半个月前，我绝对不可能相信听惯了“旗舰级DAP”的自己会甘于使用一台中低端价位的播放器，即便中低端播放器近年来也的确出现过不少声音表现优秀、拉动价位甚至行业疯狂内卷的机器，但高端播放器毕竟有自己的能力与气场：作为品牌的旗舰，一般都有着最好的用料、最新的功能配置、最前沿的DAC芯片——著名的Astell&amp;Kern甚至没事就和上游的旭化成深度合作，三代SP系列几乎成为AKM全新旗舰DAC的首发平台；同时也倾注着品牌最优秀的音乐理解。
很显然，这些资源优势都是一般中低端播放器很难获得的，所以我现在依旧不怀疑“正经厂牌的高端播放器在综合素质表现上必然优于中低端产品”；以上观点也不代表我认为“所有人都必须和我一样不买个几万块东西就别想快乐听歌”，如果你的天桥9.9耳机已经让你非常快乐，那太好了，什么设备都理应有快乐听歌的权利。我开始怀疑的是，每天没事盯着见底的工资卡、紧了吧唧的盘算着怎么搭配耳机播放器，导致我个人的生活多了一堆需要计较的大小事，这些真的能让我听歌的过程变得更“快乐”吗？

因此这半个月的时间刚好给了我一个机会，你也可以认为这种机会比较祸福相依：我自购的SP1000在半个月前，因为某些极其离谱的外部非质量原因，不慎导致2.5mm接口损坏，被迫返厂维修。设备虽然要修，歌却不能…</span>

                              <span>痛点
想想看，平时在阅读上，你做了多少无用功？
勤勤恳恳阅读，认认真真做好高亮批注。你看到自己的思考结果与文章或者书中的文字融于一体，觉得特别安心。
然而，当你需要整理或者调用这些笔记的时候，才发现它们如同断线的珠子，散落在各种地方：
RSS 阅读内容在 feedspot 里； 微信公众号的高亮在 Instapaper 里；Epub 标记在 Marginnote 里；PDF 的高亮和批注在 LiquidText 里面…… 如果不加整理，它们就会在不同的应用中终老。
问题来了，该怎么整理这些散落的阅读笔记？
有的人并不觉得这是个棘手的事情。他们的作息时间，如同钟表一般规律。可以做到每天晚上专门花时间，雷打不动把这些内容整理出来，做好分类，放在 Evernote 或者 Obsidian 里。
但是，这种方法，对于懒人显然不友好。至少我自己，就笃定无法日复一日坚持下去。即便我希望能持续一周这样操作，恐怕都得专门雇个人在旁边监督自己。
幸好，技术的进步使我们不用活得那么悲摧。有一些工具可以帮助我们汇集各种资料，尤其是帮你保管阅读记录和高亮、批注。更好的消息，是这些工具有很多，例如 Readwise, Matter, Diigo, Cubox 和简悦（Simpread）等。
本文我就以自己常用的 Readwise 为例，为你介绍如何自动化汇集整理和利用笔记。希望这些经验也能够帮到你，早日摆脱手动整理阅读笔记的困扰。

Lua is a scripting language used for procedural programming, functional programming, and even object-oriented programming. It uses a C-like syntax, but is dynamically typed, features automatic memory management and garbage collection, and runs by interpreting bytecode with a register-based virtual machine. This makes it a great language for beginners, but also a powerful tool for experienced programmers.

Apparently, the school had found my collection of children&#x27;s stories on the web. I spent a moment visualizing those students so far away, enjoying my stories on those printed pages of braille. The email&#x27;s sender might not have realized how meaningful their email was to me, but it&#x27;s stayed with me for two decades.

That experience got me thinking about how technology can weave new connections between people in different countries. While surfing…</span>

Advertisers sell the myth of the &quot;Smart Home&quot; as a magical world where you automate everything with ease to simplify your life and free your mind of trivial tasks. It looks great on paper and TV, but so far, it&#x27;s mainly been a battle of technologies and manufacturers.
Suppose you want to add a presence sensor from manufacturer A to your existing hub from manufacturer B so you can switch ON your light from manufacturer B. Or perhaps you want to switch OFF your air conditioner when your door is open, but the door sensor is not from the air conditioning manufacturer. Will it work?
There&#x27;s a significant chance that the devices you want to link to one another don&#x27;t talk the same …</span>

                              <span>iA Writer 是一款非常著名的，以简洁优美的界面和不错的使用体验著称的 Markdown 写作软件（虽然我没用过）。而最近，iA Writer 的开发商 iA.net 发布了一款名为 iA Presenter 的幻灯片制作软件，旨在通过简单的 Markdown 创作出精美的幻灯片。
市面上制作幻灯片的软件已经是数不胜数，除了常见的 PowerPoint、Keynote，还有基于 HTML5 技术的 Prezi、reveal.js、Canva 等，基于文档生成幻灯片的软件也有不少，比如双链笔记软件 Obsidian、文档工具语雀、飞书文档、石墨文档都有演示模式。
在这么多软件之中，iA Presenter 又有哪些优势，值得我们从繁杂的工作中抬起头来呢。
首先说明一下，目前 iA Presenter 还处于一个非常早期的阶段，文中提到的一些内容随时可能会因为软件的版本更新而发生变更。
另外，下文中会将 iA Presenter 简称为 iA Pre。
在此，也感谢 @南山居氪 提供的 iA Presenter 的邀请码。
PowerPoint 发生了什么
似乎现在很多软件都在以一种革命性的姿态来发布——认为自己的诞生能够颠覆一个行业，至少在发布时会伴随着一些阐述自己设计哲学的文章。Roam 和 Arc 是如此，iA Pre 也有些这样的味道。
iA 在其新闻页面上发了两篇文章，主要在说 PowerPoint 等传统幻灯片工具有什么问题，和 iA Pre 怎样使幻灯片更好？。
在第一篇文章1中，iA 认为，以 PPT 为代表的传统幻灯片工具有着入门难、耗时长、会让演讲者忘记他想说的东西、以及搭配 PPT 的演讲大多很无聊，这种无聊是我们的职业杀手以及事业杀手。
iA 怎样使幻灯片更好？
而在第二篇文章2中，iA 提出了他们认为的让演讲和幻灯片制作变得更好的方法：

Log data is one of the fastest-growing segments across data storage. It&#x27;s also one of the most complicated spaces. There are several products and solutions with overlapping use cases and confusing marketing.
This article looks at Parseable, a log storage and observability platform. Parseable is geared towards a better user experience, with an easy-to-deploy and use interface and a simple, cloud-native architecture. I&#x27;ll also show how to set up Parseable with FluentBit to store logs.

Sometimes you need to transfer files over a network. There are lots of file sharing services out there, but most require that you send your file to the Internet. This seems like a long way to go (not to mention the privacy concerns) when two computers are right beside each other, or at least in the same building. The open source WinSCP utility makes it quick and easy to transfer a file or a folder of files over the network from your Windows computer to your Linux computer.

                              <span>很多人会把人生比喻为游戏，因为都需要在既定的规则下，和他人同台竞争谋求最大胜利，读书时的升学排名，就业后岗位的激烈竞争，无一不是要决出个胜负，每个人都要追求赢。
但我们可能从来没有想过，除了参加有输赢的游戏，其实我们还可以选择另一种游戏——没有输赢，可以持续玩下去的游戏。
这便是《有限与无限的游戏》中的观点，它认为世界上至少有有限和无限两种游戏，有限游戏以获胜为目的，无限游戏以延续游戏为目的。
很神奇的是，我之前从《游戏改变世界》这本书中首次知晓该理论时，只是觉得有意思，但对我并没什么启发。

可是真的当我自己看完这本20万字的小书后，对我的影响却是立竿见影的。我读完隔天，在工作上和同事发生冲突时，脑子里一直在想着“不行，我不能像对方一样发火，我要玩的是无限游戏，争一时的输赢的玩不下去了”，因此就忍住了火气，最终也顺利解决了问题。
所以呢今天也为大家推荐这本书，看完后你一定会觉得，哇，原来有些竞争是根本没必要投入的，原来选择还可以有这么多，生活的改变从心态的改变开始，相信你也可以和我一样豁然开朗！
不过该书其实是本哲学书，理解和解读起来有一定难度，而且写法更偏意识流，作者没有特意去构建严密的框架和推理，甚至全书中作者自己都没有直接发表过「无限游戏更好」的结论，所以我会加入个人的理解去解读以便更好地介绍，但我也只是抛砖引玉，建议大家过后去看全书。
一、有限与无限游戏的基本概念
有限游戏有三个显著特征。

它是以取胜为目的，一旦决出胜负则游戏结束，所以称之为有限游戏，注意这里的胜负必须是所有参与者认同，而不是裁判或观众认同。
参与者只能在游戏界限内进行游戏。
有限游戏的规则一经所有参与者认同就生效，且不能改变，否则就是另一个游戏了。

怎么样，听起来是不是很熟悉，几乎跟我们从小到大遇到的竞争一个模式。而无限游戏则恰好是跟它反着来的，它也有三个相对的显特征。

它并非以取胜为目的…</span>

Halloween will be here before you know it! This fun, over-the-top holiday is a great time to ponder the mortal fears of the developer in each of us. What haunts you the most, in the quiet moments just before your code starts to run?
Getting into the spirit of Halloween, I asked some Opensource.com writers: What&#x27;s the scariest code you&#x27;ve seen or written?

上几篇专栏介绍了绿色系、蓝色系，自然少不了光学三原色的另一名成员——红色。这一期来讲讲红色系键帽，方便各位键友选购搭配自己的梦中情键。

GMK Red Samurai 红武士
R1 2018.2 R2 2020
BASE
这套键帽是由设计师Redsun（红太阳）设计而成，同时他也是GMK蓝武士的设计师，gmk四大武士中的两款由他设计。关于这套键帽的灵感来源有两个版本。
在R1的IC中。

作者表示灵感来自于火影忍者中宇智波斑的铠甲颜色

而在R2中

作者则表示灵感来源于井伊直政（日本历史角色）
关于作者灵感来源，我还是更加倾向于R1中的说法，而为何要改口，可能是为了规避版权问题，但我个人觉得，在红武士中其实并不能看出过多来自于漫画中的角色要素，并且忍者和武士也是两种职业，作者关于忍者和武士的定义，好像也并没有非常清晰。
配色：

暗黄、深红、灰黑，低调而不失深度的配色，黑红相间配以金色点缀，经典耐看。
个性部分：

这一套的个性数量和种类都非常丰富“忍”“侍”，其实这一套键帽虽然称之为武士，但里面也融合了非常多忍者的元素，在武器类型中“飞镰”、“团扇”、“手里剑”、“苦无”，都是非常常见的忍者标志性武器，还有一些不明所以的图案。
其实这位作者在R1中的早期个性设计，是带有浓烈火影忍者特色的。
早期个性设计
穿着盔甲的天狗，很显然是宇智波斑的须佐能乎，以及极其明显的神威万花筒写轮眼图案。
但在最终敲定版本中为了规避版权问题进行了大刀阔斧的修改，最终便呈现出一个极具忍者风味的武士主题键帽。

搭配建议：
深色无疑是合适的，这套键帽很是百搭，红色、蓝色、黄色，都能驾驭，我个人最喜欢灰色和黑色进行搭配，红色也是很不错的，但过于鲜亮的颜色搭配起来难度还是…</span>

                              <span>相信大部份人用的都是拼音輸入法。
學會一個非拼音的中文輸入法，是一件好玩的事，這是一項實用的技能，能證明你的智商和學習能力。
以後搞博客，工作，寫作，成為作家，跟人聊天，等等很多地方都能用上。
其實很多人對「形碼」還存在誤解。

誤解一，除了拼音就是五筆。
其實形碼是一衆不以拼音而是字形部件組合來輸入中文的方法。著名的有：倉頡、鄭碼、五筆，等等。
其中五筆是最有名，但又是最難學最難用的。
誤解二，形碼一定比拼音快。
其實形碼並不一定比拼音快，比如我用倉頡打「哈哈哈哈」，我輸入的是「romr romr romr romr 」，而拼音只需要輸入「hhhh 」。
也就是說，在某些特定場合，拼音，簡拼，比形碼還要快。
那形碼的優點是甚麼？形碼不是快，而是準。形碼人的思維是，如果連準確輸入都做不到，那快有甚麼用？
誤解三，五筆（形碼）很難，要背很多字根。
其實是因為五筆的字根太多太難背，才會給人這樣的感受。我用過五筆兩年，我也承認背字根是一個非常高的門檻。
但是，並不是所有形碼都跟五筆一樣難背。倉頡輸入法的字元就比五筆少很多，好記很多，記下根本不費吹灰之力。
誤解四，學個輸入法要浪費很多時間，學會了也沒甚麼用。
這是極其錯誤的想法。中文打字，不管到哪裏，都是實用的技能。現在網上到處都是同音錯字，比如「再在」不分，就是因為拼音輸入法根本打不準。那麼如果你跟別人文字聊天時，或者發表文章時，能做到用字準確，那不就是一個加分項嗎？
因此，花費一點時間，去學一個形碼，是事半功倍的事。一個好的中文輸入法，是可以用一輩子的。而你只需要用掉幾日的時間來學習。

先寫到這裏。我是中文輸入法專家尹卂，目前在用倉頡。有甚麼問題可以在下方留言。</span>

满打满算，我加入键盘爱好者圈子已经超过三年了。我感觉自己非常有幸，能亲身经历键盘圈子三年间的种种改变。这篇文章，我将结合自己的尝试过的产品、感受到的变化，给大家总结下三年间键盘风向的快速变化，以及展望下未来。
2019 年，热插拔结构萌芽
在 2019 年，客制化键盘圈子当中，热插拔结构逐渐普及开来。
那个时候我是一个很普通的键盘小白。只想要一个高端机械键盘，来满足我一个手游程序员的日常工作需求。而客制化键盘需要买家亲自去组装键盘的所有零部件。而安装轴体对于彻彻底底的小白来说，就是一个非常巨大的门槛。
在当时安装轴体的方法有两种，一种就是传统的焊接，需要用户学习焊接的基础知识，需要购买焊台，焊锡，学习焊接轴体的操作技巧。如果操作不当，还有可能把键盘电路板烧毁、损毁轴体。由于客制化键盘都是采用团购的形式，制作工期极长，所有的零件都是根据购买量定制的，电路板有个三长两短，再找一块电路板来，就不是那么容易的事情了。焊接完成之后，想要更换轴体，更是一件麻烦事，需要重新拆解键盘，学习使用吸锡器。
键盘带有热插拔结构之后，只需要在安装之前，掌握轴体的安装方向，轻轻一按，轴体就安装完成了。可以说是小白新手的福音，能极大的降低客制化键盘圈子的入圈门槛。而在当时，愿意增加热插拔结构的客制化键盘却非常少。
造成这一现象的原因可以分成两方面看待：
一是客观原因。在当时，客制化键盘的生产线没有现今那么强大。零件需要外包出去制作。负责生产的工厂水平参差不齐，最终生产的成品，出现划痕、刀痕、色差也是时有发生。最严重的情况就是外包的工厂心术不正，直接卷钱跑路。…</span>

@王百顺BS：Nutale Air Pro - Airtag下位替代品

入手渠道：淘宝
入手价格：192 元

新发布的 AirPods Pro 内置了 Airtag 又让我重新对这个去年发布的小东西提起了兴趣，恰好看到 Nutale Air Pro 打折，四个套装比单个 Airtag 还便宜，就想试试能不能作为平替。
先放两张外观的图片：
正面：金属边框，两面塑料，有一颗按键，一个发声的开槽（按键手感很差软塌塌的没有反馈）背面：有个放纽扣电池的盖子，用手一推就能打开，一颗 CR2032 纽扣电池
几天试用下来体验还不错，有「Works with Apple Find My」的认证所以可以直接在「查找」app 中的「物品」这一栏添加设备，所有的操作也都是在「查找」app 中，和查看其他 Apple 的设备操作一样。
在查找 app 中的界面，这个两个物品都是
价格便宜自然会有一些缺失的功能，比如：精确查找。 就是到达 Airtag 附近（大概 20 米以内吧）之后触发精确查找，告诉你在什么方向还有多远。 这个功能在 Nutale Air Pro 上是没有的（据说是因为 Apple 还没有开放 UWB 所以市面上还没有第三方的产品具备精确查找），你只能到达附近之后通过播放声音来寻找，声音大小用 Apple Watch 粗略测试了一下可以达到 95 分贝，装到帆布包里间隔两米声音大概 60 分贝，装在包里隔一堵墙距离大概 7 米就需要仔细听了。
精确查找：图片来自 Apple 官网截图

                              <span>前言
2022年10月24日，特斯拉官宣降价，基础版本model 3降价1.4万，model y降价2.8万，可以说是非常大的降价幅度，结合2022款整体上更新的车机芯片加上扩大的电池容量，一部分车款可以说是重回性价比车型的行列。
我们讲电车使用成本低，是基于有家用充电桩的环境，如果都用特斯拉超充，不算停车费，每公里电费都能到3毛以上，而使用谷时电家充，每公里电费可以控制在5分钱。但家充桩需要有固定车位，还要向电网申请电表，以及需要物业允许施工的证明，这些硬性条件也劝退着一些潜在车主。
而除了固定的家用充电桩，还有便携充电器，也就是随车充可以作为新能源车的补能方案。随车充在使用上可以使用家庭插座，支持自带线缆从家中接到室外充电，不需要独立电表，对于公司有插座、农村有自建房以及低楼层居民楼住户都比较友好。
本篇选择了四款随车充，覆盖了品牌、设计特点、功率支持的几个不同方向，来详细对比产品设计和具体功能，希望能为随车充的选择答疑解惑。
缆上控制与保护装置（IC-CDP)

其实随车充产品我分析过很多次，它本质上就是从电源到新能源车电机的连接装置，换言之就是一根电源线，电能转化为电池电量都是在新能源车内部完成的。而对于随车充产品消费首先需要重点关注的就是是否配备了缆上控制与保护装置，缩写为IC-CDP。
在国家标准GB/T 18487.1-2015《电动汽车传导充电系统 第一部分:通用要求》中，将就是一根电缆连接电动汽车和交流电网的随车充称为模式1产品；将电缆上加入IC-CDP的随车充产品称为模式2产品。前者可以为车充电，根据电缆长度不同售价在200元上下，但模式1产品缺乏保护功能和控制功能，便宜但抗风险能力基本为0。后者模式2则是大部分车主的核心选择，通过控制盒可以实现各种差异化功能，特斯拉、比亚迪的原厂随车充我们称为车规产品，都是模式2随车充。
对于我们私家车主而言，充电安全…</span>

2022 年，对我来说是不平凡的一年，键圈的兴亡成败在这一年格外明显。也是这一年我开始从一个消费者转变成一个创作者，遇到了更多的人，也想了了更多过去不会思考的问题。下面来讲讲我这一年的所思所想和所感，以及今后的一些打算。虽然都是些浅短的认识，但是分享出来也算是一种体验，非常感谢大家的观看和意见。欢迎评论区友好讨论。
键盘圈的大趋势
现代社会人与人的交流不再局限于过去话语和书信的形式，而更多倾向于快捷的网络输入交流。快捷频繁的信息互通使得输入工具成为生活工作长时间高频率接触的日常用品。2020 年的疫情提早将线上办公大规模地带入人们的生活之中，人们也重新开始审视自己的办公桌搭，机械键盘市场在疫情之下，不降反增。
机械键盘热度上涨这件事，无论是从日常生活中关于机械键盘话题讨论度愈发增高，还是从近些年来机械键盘品牌数急剧增加都可以得到一定程度的论证。
数据来源：什么值得买
近些年来，在机械键盘领域我能明显感知到的就是选择越来越多了，无论是量产还是客制化，无论是轴体、键帽、套件。国内机械键盘在「物质」水平上，毫无疑问的成长了。
在轴体领域，国产轴体自 2010-2012 开始萌芽，在 2019 年这个关键节点打出了名声，国内轴体市场也从 Cherry 的独角戏演变成现在的百家争鸣。
佳达隆的产品时间线 2012—2020
在键帽领域，过去的客制化玩家大多只能选择 GMK、SP 等海外品牌，如今有国产老牌客制化键帽 JTK、2019 年出现的 Domikey 和 2022 年入场的 PBTfans 以及各种各样的键帽代工厂，包括量产领域也出…</span>

                              <span>之前，我在《论文读不懂怎么办？》一文中，给你介绍了论文阅读遇到问题时的几个解决方法。尤其是介绍了你可以求助的免费资源和路径，它们包括但不限于：

幻灯
博客
视频
课程
代码

那篇文章，在知乎上获得了 2600 个赞（截止 2022 年 10 月）。我相信，对于很多同学，起到了帮助。

只不过，环境和技术在变化，我们解决问题的方法和思路，也应该与时俱进。
这不，因为有了大规模自然语言处理模型的加持，阅读论文时遇到不认识的名词，或者无法理解作者的简单解释时，我们有了一种新的对策。
具体的方法，就是人工智能替你阅读后，把内容综合整理，结合上下文转换成简单清晰的语言，再反馈给你。
这个想法，其实并不新鲜了。翻看近几年自然语言处理领域的论文，你能看见不少相关的研究。
只不过，那些研究成果只存在论文中，或者是在某个实验室的电脑里面，普通人根本无法接触，更不要说利用了。
这回可不一样，有人（ \@amanjha__ and \@functionofjade）居然真的就做了个产品出来。
这个应用的名字，叫做 explainpaper ，非常直白吧？

使用起来也特别方便。不用去菜单里面点选找寻。只要你把论文传上去，高亮某一个词语、短语或者段落，人工智能就会自动为你解读。

不仅如此，你还可以就着 AI 反馈的结果，继续追问。
这种应用演示不大适合图文。所以我干脆为你做了 一段演示视频，你可以先看看。
 
 
看完之后，感受如何？
反正不少小伙伴表示，很兴奋。

这东西背后的技术是啥？当然还是咱们的老熟人 ------GPT-3.
其实 GPT-3 这模型的特点，说穿了就是大。因为模型庞大，参数众多，所以从海量语料库里积攒的「认知」就多。注意我这里刻意回避了「知识」这个词儿。

（资料来源：t.ly/cY1kn）
从上图中，你不难看到，现在的文本和代码生成中，GPT-3 都占据了重要位置。
我喜欢共享内容的原因之一，是视频发出后总可以获得观众进一步的反馈。不少的问题，都会激发我的思考。
例如有小伙伴在视频后面提问，说这个东西能不能帮着理解中文论文啊？

这是个很好的问题。毕竟很多国内人文社科研究生平时阅读的论文，更大比例是中文的。
我一开始觉得这个问题问得有些太贪心了。对于一个外国人做的刚上线应用，你指望人家立即支持阅读中文，还能看懂中文的研究论文，不大现实吧？
刚要回复，我突然想起来 上次在 Lex 上面的教训了。既然 explainpaper 的底层模型是 GPT-3 ，那它本来就该认得中文啊。
为了确保回答准确，还是实际测试一下吧。我传了一篇自己的论文上去。

中文划线高亮之后，AI 反馈的结果让我有些吃惊。
尽管 explainpaper 并不能直接用中文来解释信息。但它可以立即识别出「知识管理」就是 knowledge management ，然后进一步解释下去。
下面这段解释，就更有意思了。

它先广泛解释「插件」是啥，然后结合本文的上下文，指出 Roam Toolkit 是一种插件，并且描述了它的功能。
不仅如此，从下图可以看出，就连划线的时候字符之间出现了空格间隔，也依然能正常识别和解释。

下面，我故意找了个文中没有进行详细解释的「概念网络」，结果是这样的。

我能确定，这解释里面出现的「宠物」、「猫」、「狗」啥的，肯定没在本文正文出现过。
Evernote 这一段，让我愣住了。

Explainpaper 居然是准确识别了这张表格，并且把内容总结梳理，然后用英文输出了出来。
上述的演示，是不是回答了读者的问题呢？我觉得算不上。从需求分析来看，人家看中文论文遇到术语不清楚，自然是需要中文的解释。你再弄成英文给我，这......
可换个角度想想，这东西帮助外国人阅读中文论文，可是再好不过了。遇到中文专业词汇，随时可以获得准确的英文解释，而且阐述还贴合论文的上下文。外国人读中文论文，将减少很多障碍。这或许可以快速提升中文论文的影响力，妙啊！
另外，目前 explainpaper 缺乏中文解释能力，也给国内的开发者提供了发展空间。希望早日看到更多 AI 实际应用上线，帮助国人理解中文论文。
我期待你能自己尝试一下这款在线应用。至少在目前，它是免费的。而且因为上传的都是公开发表的论文，也不存在用户隐私泄漏问题。所以可以放心大胆地尝试 ------ 特别是对于最近要写文献综述的小伙伴来说。
欢迎你把自己测试的结果和经验心得，分享在留言区。咱们一起交流讨论。
祝论文阅读愉快！

                              <span>伴随 iOS 16.1 的发布，YaoYao 也适配了 iOS 16.1 相关功能
 
 
灵动岛
当你在手表上开始运动后，再打开手机App，你将发现YaoYao 的灵动岛功能。
灵动岛在 iPhone 14 Pro 上可以使用，你可以把灵动岛理解成一个indicator。

具体有多大用，实际我也没太明白，再就是要看这个功能提供后，各路厂商的想象力，以我自己的判断，Apple 可能也没太明白，这个应该会在后面继续迭代。
实时活动（Live Activity）
这个实时活动和灵动岛是一起的，绑定的，这也是我不太能理解的地方。它不需要iPhone 14 Pro，其他手机也会显示，你可以把它理解成一个特殊的通知.
它能实时显示新跳绳的运动数据，在 iPhone 14 Pro常亮屏的加持下更加好用，个人认为常亮屏是 iPhone 14 Pro 最大的亮点，就像 Apple Watch 自从有了常亮显示，体验大大提高一样。
Live Activity
Apple Watch Ultra 操作按钮（Action Button)
为了适配 Apple Watch Ultra 这个特殊的自定义键（Action Button，手表左侧这个黄色键），我特意买了一个 Ultra，现在在系统里配置该键后，你就可以：
 
 
1. 一键启动YaoYao
2. 按下该键暂停运动
3. 再按下恢复运动（或和右边的侧边键同时按下）
因为不用看屏幕可以直接按，减少了心智负担，实际使用非常好用！变成了我最喜欢 Ultra的功能。之前感觉佳明表全是按键操作，不能触控，拿到手完全不会用，感觉很傻，看来也有一定道理，哈哈。

请将App 更新到最新版，尝鲜以上功能。
