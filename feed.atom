Google has quietly expanded its “User Choice Billing” pilot to let more developers of non-gaming Android apps offer third-party payment options as alternatives to Google Play’s. Developers will see their service fees of 15 to 30 percent reduced by 4 percent when users select a new third-party billing option, which the developer — not Google — must support in case of customer issues. The news was first reported by 9to5Google.
Now, as of September 1st, registered developers from the European Economic Area (EEA), India, Japan, Indonesia, and Australia can participate in User Choice Billing, according to this enrollment page. Google contends that 99 percent of developers using the company’s own Play Store billing qualify for the 15 percent...

Over the next few months, we will add the following features:

🫶Profile sharing (a.k.a. Ceeyalord): We found out that many of our users want to promote and endorse each other and are sharing other people’s Ceeya pages on their own. We’d like to turn this behavior into a built-in feature so that it’s much easier to offer or ask others to share yours. We believe this will be a great way to increase visibility and lead generation. Who knows? If your page receives a lot of clicks and engagement, you may even sell a slot on your page, becoming a landlord 💸… I mean Ceeyalord :)

🃏More cards: We’re receiving a lot of feature requests to build different types of cards, like a digital download, video/photo sharing, blog entry, or even Pokemon cards (🤯duh?). One of our favorite requests is a secret card where its contents can only be opened with a passcode. The imagination is limitless. We will build more types of cards going forward for sure. At the same time, we can’t do it alone. At some point, we will open up our SDK so that other developers can build any types of cards they want to offer to our users.

Distributed systems such as microservices have led to an increase in the complexity of the systems we work with. It is difficult to have full confidence in this architecture when there are many components and “a lot of moving parts” that could potentially fail. It is critical to handle failures in service-to-service calls gracefully. Also, we want to be sure that any resilience mechanisms we have in place such as error handling code, circuit breaker, health checks, retry, fallback, redundant instances, and so on. We can verify this with the help of the testing method Fault Injection 💉.

While skimming through SQL to prepare for interviews, I often come across this question: Find the employee with the highest or (second-highest) salary by joining a table containing employee information with another that contains department information. This raises a further question: What about finding the employee who earns the nth-highest salary department-wide?

GitHub 宣布将于 9 月 30 日关闭其趋势（Trending）页面，原因这个针对存储库和开发者做出排名榜单的功能使用率较低。这一决定引来了大量反对意见，很多人表示，自己访问 GitHub 的首页就是趋势页面，也有人表示自己收藏的一半以上的仓库来自于趋势页面。


消息来源：GitHub



老王点评：这个功能的成本并不高，按说没有必要关闭。有人猜测是由于之前中文项目充斥榜单，引来了非中文用户的抗议，作为余波导致 GitHub 关闭此功能。但我不这样认为，之前确实有过中文项目比较多的情况，但是随着国内用户使用 GitHub 越来越困难，中文项目随之减少。所以这个事情应该是 GitHub 有别的考虑。

多达 140 万安装量的 Chrome 扩展会注入推广代码

有五个提供包括群发 Netflix 视频、屏幕截图等各种服务的 Chrome 扩展程序，被发现在偷偷跟踪用户的浏览历史，并在用户访问的特定电子商务网站中插入跟踪代码。该代码修改了网站的 cookie，这样扩展程序的作者就能收到购买物品的推广付款。谷歌已经移除了这些扩展程序，但已经安装了这些扩展程序的 140 万用户并不会自动卸载这些扩展，并将依然受到影响。


消息来源：ARS Technica



老王点评：其实安装浏览器扩展也需要小心，这些扩展的行为往往并没有得到检查。]]></summary>

At least that's what people are saying online. But whether there's any truth to that, is another story.

Before we get into Bun directly, let's get into what a JS engine actually is and does.
For as long as developers can remember, JavaScript was mainly confined to running inside of a web browser.
And to do so, it needs some kind of engine to parse the JavaScript and to turn it into a functional application that users can interact with and see.
There is a good chance that you have at least heard of 1 popular JavaScript engine, that being the V8 engine created by Google and intended for use on Chrome. It is also the engine used by N…]]></summary>

I decided it's best to re-look at some previous articles to explore the new way of doing things in Astro.
In this article, we'll be looking at running React components in Astro. (the old way of adding React in Astro)
Let's use the minimal started pack from Astro. This is the easiest to use as it's clean.
mkdir astro-react && cd astro-react

Once you have your folder installed, you can install the minimal starter.
npm init astro -- --template minimal

Once installed, we'll have our super basic Astro started. Let's go ahead and add the React rendered.
npm run astro add react

This will add React and the rendered and the needed config to your Astro config file.

Storage gateway allow you to link on prem applications to AWS and cashing data locally for low latency access.
With Storage Gateway, it is easy to simplify storage management and drastically cut cost by going hybrid. It can also  be used as Disaster Recovery  strategy by  making sure that backups are stored somewhere else and can be recovery in case of a disaster.
It is important to mention that storage gateway is nota free service. For more information regarding storage gateway prices , please check the link here 

AWS Storage Gateway offers three different types of gateways: File Gateway, Volume Gateway and Tape Gateway.
 File Gateway store files as block on amazon S3 using NFS or SMB protocol.

 Volume Gateway is used to backup volume data as EBS snapshots in Amazon S3 using the Iscsi protocol. It has 2 types of volumes: Store Volumes and Cash Volumes.
a.    Cache Volume store all on prem data on S3 and only keep recently accessed data locally. 
b.    Store Volume store the primary data locally while it is backups that data as EBS snapshot into S3.

 Tape Gateway (VTL) allow on prem orgs that already have a Tape Library to back up their virtual dates in S3

Its HTTP-based connection model makes integrating with serverless computing services like AWS Lambda easy. One of the additional capabilities of Amazon DynamoDB is the global tables, which allows you to run replica instances of the database in other regions.
In this blog post, I will touch on Amazon DynamoDB global tables in the context of the AWS CDK framework – there are a couple of nuances with huge implications you should be aware of.
Let us dive in.
There are two ways I'm aware of to create global tables using AWS CDK, with one of them being, in my humble opinion, much better for the maintainability of your application.

Workers at the Penn Square Apple Store in Oklahoma City have filed with the National Labor Relations Board to hold a union election, becoming the third US location to have done so. According to a press release, over 70 percent of the store’s salespeople, genius admins, technicians, creatives, and operations specialists, have signed cards to say they’re interested in being represented by the Communications Workers of America (CWA). 
The NLRB’s bar for a sufficient showing of interest for an election is 30 percent of workers signing union cards.

Developer and App Store critic Kosta Eleftheriou has settled his lawsuit with Apple, according to a report from TechCrunch. The suit, filed in March 2021, argued that Apple made it difficult for him to sell his app, Flicktype, on the App Store, after it seemingly lost interest in acquiring the tech.
The lawsuit alleged that Apple used its monopoly power as maker of the iPhone and as the company in charge of the App Store to “crush” developers competing with it through “exploitive fees and selective application of opaque and unreasonable constraints.” Eleftheriou also accused Apple of doing little to stem the tide of copycat scam apps that tricked potential users of his app, a swipe-based keyboard for the Apple Watch.

The new subscription will allow Xbox Game Pass members to share with up to four other friends or family members at €21.99 per month in Ireland, and 49,900 COP in Colombia.
Microsoft isn’t restricting this new Game Pass plan to just family members, and the only restriction is that people who are added to the Friends & Family plan need to be in the same country.

Tablets exist in a space between phones and laptops that is becoming increasingly muddled. As phones become more powerful and gain larger displays, laptops continue to get lighter. Tablet manufacturers haven’t been resting on their laurels, though. Many of the more recent tablets we’ve seen are looking to bridge the gap in terms of performance and, in select cases, handle some tasks more efficiently than both phones and laptops.
The tablet spectrum is varied, too. Inexpensive models like the Amazon Fire HD 10 make for excellent media streaming devices, while those in Microsoft’s versatile Surface lineup can easily serve as ad-hoc laptops when paired with an optional folio-style keyboard. Then there’s the ubiquitous iPad, a slate that has...

Unless you sat at a very specific point in front of them, they resulted in a warped image, harsh reflections, and a generally unpleasant viewing experience, for close to no benefit. Seriously, they were terrible. It felt like curved TVs happened because companies could make them, rather than because they should.
It took me a little while to realize it, but LG’s new 42-inch OLED Flex, which it’s announced this week at IFA and hopes to bring to market this fall, effectively marks the return of curved TVs.

The Wall Street Journal reports T-Mobile’s engineering and network operations teams are experiencing waves of layoffs, which have included managers and executives, on top of thousands of jobs eliminated by restructuring after the company merged with Sprint in 2020. T-Mobile execs promised then that the merger was “all about creating new, high-quality, high-paying jobs, and the new T-Mobile will be jobs-positive from Day One and every day thereafter.”  
In April 2020, the companies had about 80,000 workers combined; however, as the Journal points out, T-Mobile’s most recent annual report (pdf) said it ended 2021 with 75,000 full- and part-time employees.

Sennheiser’s debut soundbar, released in 2019, was a niche product for a couple of reasons. The first was the price. At $2,499.95, it rivaled the cost of many traditional surround sound systems comprised of AV receivers and multiple speakers. But perhaps more important was its size. I say this with love, but the original Ambeo Soundbar (which has now been renamed the Ambeo Soundbar Max) was a chunky boy, which hardly made it an easy sell for anyone looking to tuck it discreetly in front of their TV. 
So although it’s $1,000 cheaper, I think price might only be the second most important change with Sennheiser’s second soundbar, the $1,499.95 Ambeo Soundbar Plus, which the company launched today at an event in Berlin. Instead, I think its...

When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. 
Amazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. 
Below, we’ve listed each model currently available. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one or any of the products — which is...

Microsoft has added a new sidebar to its Edge browser with buttons that let you see information about a site, check your email, access Microsoft Office, and even strip the essential elements of a recipe out of an overly long post (via Windows Central). The new feature seems to build on the “Search in sidebar” function added to Edge in 2020, but it adds even more multitasking abilities.
The sidebar includes some small but useful panes, like the one that lets you search the web and quickly read articles, or the one that includes a variety of widgets, such as a calculator, dictionary, internet speed test, and unit convertor. Some of the panes are more fully featured; the Outlook one, for example, lets you read and send emails, as well as...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[有 许多可用于 Linux 的终端仿真器。从 Terminator 到 Tilix，你有多种终端可供选择。

但这并没有阻止新终端应用的到来。你最近已经见过了 GNOME Console 吧，今天，我将向你介绍 Blackbox。

Blackbox 终端：概述和功能

Blackbox 是一个支持 GTK4 的终端仿真器。开发者为了他可以在 Linux 上使用外观优美的终端应用而创建了这个项目。

所以，不要指望它有很多功能。它只是一个使用 GTK4 工具包并支持主题的终端仿真器。

换句话说，它更多注重的是关于外观而不是功能。

以下是 Blackbox 的主要亮点：


可设置主题（支持 Tilix 兼容的配色方案）

主题与窗口装饰的融合

自定义字体

各种可自定义的 UI 设置

标签

可切换的标题栏

点击打开链接

文件拖放支持


谈到外观，让我们来看看它提供的不同外观。默认窗口将类似于下面的截图。



没有标题栏

你也可以取消标题栏，如下所示。这是 GTK4 应用程序中最“流行”的功能之一。



你还可以在无标题栏模式下启用浮动控件。



轻松复制和粘贴（不要抗拒）

Ctrl+C 和 Ctrl+V 就像复制粘贴的通用键盘快捷键。

但是古老的 Unix 在宇宙之前就存在了，因此它使用 Ctrl+C 键来终止终端中正在运行的程序。

但是，有些人发现不能使用他们最喜欢的快捷键来 在终端中复制粘贴 有点不方便。

Blackbox 允许你通过启用“轻松复制和粘贴”设置来更改它。启用此设置后，你可以使用 Ctrl+C 和 Ctrl+v 进行复制粘贴操作。

不用担心。Ctrl+C 仍可用于停止正在运行的命令。



主题

你还可以从设置中选择不同的主题。有几个浅色和深色主题可供选择。你还可以使用 Tilix 风格的主题。



让我们看看它在 Yaru 主题和不扩展选项卡的情况下的外观，这与默认的 Blackbox 行为不同。



重置为默认

还有一些更方便的功能，例如记住窗口大小、按像素滚动等。

好消息是，如果你对设置进行了太多更改，你可以将它们全部还原并重置为默认设置。

该选项在“首选项Preferences”的“高级Advance”选项卡中可用。



安装 Blackbox 终端

请记住，Blackbox 处于开发的早期阶段。我在切换主题时出现过崩溃。

要安装 Blackbox 终端，你应该在系统中安装 Flatpak 并启用 Flathub 仓库。

使用此命令在你的系统上安装 Blackbox：

flatpak install flathub com.raggesilver.BlackBox


在 Fedora 和其他一些与 Flatpak 集成的发行版上，你可以从软件中心安装 Blackbox。



安装后，你可以从应用菜单启动它。

卸载 Blackbox 终端

如果你不喜欢 Blackbox 并想将其删除，请输入以下命令将其删除。

flatpak uninstall flathub com.raggesilver.BlackBox


结论

在我看来，Blackbox 是一个不错的终端模拟器。在不支持 GTK4 的发行版上，你可以获得 GTK4 所能提供的所有精彩内容。它提供的功能足以应付日常工作。

最后，这一切都取决于个人喜好。你可能会喜欢它，也可能不喜欢它。如果你喜欢体验，请尝试一下，并在评论栏与我们分享你的经验。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你们好！我一直在编写一本关于调试的杂志（这是 目录的初稿）。

作为其中的一部分，我认为阅读一些关于调试的学术论文可能会很有趣，上周 Greg Wilson 给我发了一些关于调试学术研究的论文。

其中一篇论文（《建立一个调试教学的框架[付费墙]》）对我们有效调试所需的不同种类的知识/技能进行了分类，我非常喜欢。它来自另一篇关于故障排除的更一般性的论文：《学会排错：一个新的基于理论的设计架构》。

我认为这个分类对于思考如何更好地进行调试是一个非常有用的结构，所以我把论文中的五个类别重新规划为你可以采取的行动，以提高调试的效率。

以下是这些行动：

1、学习代码库

要调试一些代码，你需要了解你正在使用的代码库。

这似乎有点显而易见（当然，不了解代码的工作原理，你就无法调试代码！）

这种学习随着时间的推移会很自然地发生，而且实际上调试也是 学习 一个新的代码库如何工作的最好方法之一—— 看到一些代码是如何崩溃的，有助于你了解它是如何工作的。

该论文将此称为“系统知识”。

2、学习系统

论文中提到，你需要了解编程语言，但我认为不止于此 —— 为了修复 bug，往往你需要学习很多更广泛的环境，而不仅仅是语言。

举个例子，如果你是后端 Web 开发者，你可能需要的一些“系统”知识包括：


HTTP 缓存如何工作

CORS

数据库事务是如何工作的


我发现我经常需要更有意识地去学习像这样的系统性的东西 —— 我需要真正花时间去查找和阅读它们。

该论文将此称为“领域知识”。

3、学习你的工具

现在有很多工具，例如：


调试器（GDB 等）

浏览器开发工具

剖析器profiler

strace / ltrace

tcpdump / wireshark

核心转储

甚至像错误信息这样的基本东西（如何正确阅读它们）


我在这个博客上写了很多关于调试工具的文章，并且肯定学习这些工具给我带来了巨大的变化。

该论文将此称为“处理性知识”。

4、学习策略

这是最模糊的一类，在如何高效调试的过程中，我们都有很多策略和启发式方法。比如说：


写一个单元测试

写一个小的独立程序来重现这个错误

找到一个能工作的版本的代码，看看有什么变化

打印出无数的东西

增加额外的日志记录

休息一下

向朋友解释这个错误，然后在中途发现问题所在

查看 GitHub 上的问题，看看是否有匹配的问题


在写这本杂志的时候，我一直在思考这个类别，但我想让这篇文章简短，所以我不会在这里多说。

该论文将此称为“战略知识”。

5、获得经验

最后一个类别是“经验”。这篇论文对此有一个非常有趣的评论：


他们的研究结果并没有显示出新手和专家所采用的策略有什么明显的区别。专家只是形成了更多正确的假设，并且在寻找故障方面更有效率。作者怀疑这个结果是由于新手和专家之间的编程经验不同造成的。


这真的引起了我的共鸣 —— 我遇到过很多第一次遇到时非常令人沮丧和困难的 bug，而在第五次、第十次或第二十次时就非常简单了。

对我来说，这也是最直接的知识类别之一 —— 你需要做的就是调查一百万个 bug，反正这就是我们作为程序员的全部生活 : ) 。这需要很长的时间，但我觉得它发生得很自然。

本文将此称为“经验知识”。

就这样吧！

我打算把这篇文章写得很短，我只是非常喜欢这个分类，想把它分享出来。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[@mark_e_winter and @matthewmihok we’re building the Heroku for Machine Learning.

Unweave gives you instant serverless infrastructure to train your machine learning models. It gets you up and running with fully reproducible training environments with near zero config.

The inspiration for Unweave, and the tagline, came from the countless hours spent spinning up EC2 instances, managing S3 buckets, tweaking config files and writing heaps of boilerplate code just to get some extra processing power and storage capacity.
It led us to ask ourselves: what if you could keep that gleamingly smooth Macbook Pro user experience but bundle it with infinite storage and computing capacity?

That’s what we’ve set out to build with Unweave.

Unweave works in one simple way: if you run `unweave python train.py` instead of `python train.py`, it automatically builds and runs your environment in the cloud, within seconds, while versioning everything you run end-to-end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用这些开源工具来记笔记。


笔记是任何作者生活的一部分。我的大部分文章都是从笔记应用开始的，这对我来说通常是 Joplin。有大量适用于 Linux 的笔记应用，你可能使用的不是我最喜欢的应用。最近的一篇博客文章让我想起了其中的六个，所以我整理了一份我最喜欢的列表。

Joplin



Joplin 适用于 Linux、Windows、macOS、Android 和 iOS。我喜欢 Joplin，因为它会自动保存你添加的任何内容。笔记可以上传到 NextCloud、OwnCloud、Joplin Cloud，甚至是 OneDrive、Dropbox 或任何 WebDav 应用等闭源服务。Joplin 还支持加密。

以各种格式导出笔记也很容易。它带有八个不同的主题，可让你定制其外观。

Joplin 采用 MIT 许可证。最初于 2017 年发布，Joplin 正在与大量贡献者社区一起持续开发。

Xournal



Xournal 适用于 Linux、Windows、macOS 和 Android。它的目的是让你创建包含几乎任何你可以想象的媒体类型的笔记。它支持压敏手写笔和绘图板，因此你可以创建 涂鸦笔记。你可以在里面打字、绘制简单的矢量、导入图形、录制音频等等。你还可以使用 Xournal 来注释 PDF，这就是我使用它的方式。它以 GPLv2 许可证发布，你可以以多种格式导出笔记。

Trillium



Trillium 是一个层级笔记应用，专注于知识构建库。它具有丰富的所见即所得编辑功能，支持表格、图像和 Markdown。它支持使用语法高亮编辑源代码中的注释。它是在 AGPL 许可证下发布的。

Trilium 可用作 Linux 和 Windows 的桌面应用，以及你可以在自己的 Linux 服务器上托管的 Web 应用。

Gnote



Gnote 是一个为 Linux 编写的开源笔记应用。它是由 Hubert Figuière 从一个名为 Tomboy 的项目中克隆出来的。与 Tomboy 一样，Gnote 使用类似 Wiki 的链接系统来允许你将笔记链接在一起。

GNote 的源代码可在 GitLab 上找到。该软件是 GPLv3 许可。

CherryTree



CherryTree 支持层级笔记。在 CherryTree 中，所有东西都是一个节点。节点可以是纯文本、富文本、各种编程语言的语法高亮。每个节点可以有子节点，每个子节点有不同的格式。

CherryTree 具有富文本和语法高亮的特点，并可以将数据存储在一个 XML 或 SQLite 文件中。CherryTree 可以从各种格式导入，包括 Markdown、HTML、纯文本、Gnote、Tomboy 和其他格式。它可以将文件导出为 PDF、HTML、纯文本和它自己的 CherryTree 格式。

CherryTree 使用 GPLv3 许可，可以安装在 Linux、Windows 和 macOS 上。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[刚接触效率软件的朋友，经常会被两类软件弄混淆：
一类是清单/待办/Todo类软件，比如知名的滴答清单、极简待办、Reminder（苹果系统自带的提醒事项）、Microsoft to do、Things3、Sorted3、Todoist等等。
一类是日历类软件，比如苹果手机、华为手机系统自带的日历app，还有一些第三方的日历软件，比如Fantastical、Busycal、Google日历、Calendars等等。
这两类都能可以记录待办事项，进行时间上的规划，比如它们都能实现像「周三出差」、「5月3日购物」这样的日程提醒，但是二者又有很多不同之处，比如界面上的差异、使用方法上的差异等等。如果用更专业的术语来形容，这两类软件的目标也有显著的差别，前者主要进行任务（Tasks）管理，后者主要进行日程或时间（Time）管理，侧重点是不一样的。
这篇文章会从新手角度，聊一聊如何开启一段效率之旅。文章讲的内容比较浅显，一部分来自我这两年的探索，另一部分来自少数派友的分享。推荐大家读一读 @闲者时间_王掌柜君的文章（注意搜索之后选择「不限时间」，否则很容易错过早先的好文章），这篇文章也受到王掌柜 《术与道-聊聊我的时间管理》 这篇文章的启发，推荐大家阅读。
概念梳理
待办清单：侧重任务管理
第一类待办软件，顾名思义，就是以处理等待办理的事情，核心功能落在要做的「事件」上。
这类软件最简单的使用方法，就是在Inbox（收件箱）里输入一件待办事项。比如你想约几个老友抽空聚餐，只要在收件箱里记下这几个字，无需更多设置，等到你打开软件，看到这句话，就会起到提醒的作用。
如果你想要把这件事情规划得更详细，也可以为它设置各种属性，比如确定时间（约好在下周三晚8点），也可以预设提醒（前一天21:00提醒你，以提前安排出行），还可以设置标签（放到 #生活 这个标签下）、优先级（高，毕竟老朋友难得聚一次…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apache OpenOffice 下载量超过 3.33 亿次，主要是 Windows 用户

虽然 Apache OpenOffice 开源办公套件的发展几乎停滞不前，而 LibreOffice 一直在提供更现代的特性和功能，有趣的是，人们仍然在继续下载和使用 OpenOffice。Apache 软件基金会在周二宣布，自从他们在 2011 年接管这个开源办公套件以来，现在已经有超过 3.33 亿次下载。有些讽刺的是，根据公开的数字显示，Windows 用户的下载量为 2.97 亿，macOS 用户的下载量为 3100 万，而 Linux 用户的下载量仅为 470 万。另外，在 2020 年他们庆祝下载了 3 亿次。也就是说前 10 年平均每年有 3000 万次，而最近两年平均 1600 万次。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：Linux 用户数很少的一个原因是，几乎所有桌面 Linux 都预装的是 LibreOffice 而不是 OpenOfficce。这算不算唯一的 Windows 用户远超 Linux 用户的大型开源软件？另外，作为一个参考，2018 年，LibreOffice 说他们有 2 亿活跃用户，下载量理论上更多。




QEMU 7.1 发布，支持 LoongArch 64 位架构

QEMU 7.1 在开源 Linux 虚拟化堆栈中发挥着重要作用。在最新的版本中，提供了对 LoongArch 64 位架构的初步支持，目标是为了匹配 Loongson 3A5000 SoC 和 Loongson 7A1000 主机桥。此版本还增加了对 RISC-V 1.12 特权规格的支持。支持 Linux 上的 QEMU 的零拷贝发送，以减少虚拟机迁移时对源主机的 CPU 占用。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：QEMU 对龙芯的支持意义重大，虽然我对龙芯对 RISC-V 的批评不以为然，但是看到龙芯的发展还是应该点个赞。




恶意应用伪装成谷歌翻译桌面应用来挖矿

尽管谷歌翻译从未推出过桌面版，但是用户搜索就可能会在结果页面看到一些免费软件网站提供下载。IT 安全组织 CPR 发布了一份报告，称其发现了隐藏在看起来合法的应用程序背后的加密挖掘恶意软件活动。这些欺诈程序包括桌面版的谷歌翻译、Yandex 翻译、微软翻译、YouTube Music 等等。


消息来源：Checkpoint



老王点评：虽然我们肯定不会从第三方下载来源不明的这种所谓官方应用，但是真有大量用户去下载。]]></summary>

@rubber9soul：给iPod找个家

购买渠道：咸鱼二手
购买价格：500元

最近迷恋从二手平台淘一些音频设备，这些「老家伙」使用起来不像现在的很多设备那样便利，但是声音上还是非常讲究的。
因为手里还留了几部 iPod，一直想买一个 Dock 音箱让它们继续发光发热，看了一圈之后锁定了 Bose SoundDock II。

在 iPod 鼎盛的时期，很多厂商会专门推出 Dock 音箱，其中 Bose 也非常积极，先后推出了很多代产品。Bose SoundDock II 最早发布于 2008 年，到现在已经十四年「高龄」了。它使用的是 30pin 接口，也是 Bose 最后一代兼容这个接口的 Dock 音箱（之后换为Lightning）。
SoundDock II 的声音也是 Bose 典型的调音风格，声音浑厚注重氛围感；因为两个全频喇叭有一定的横向间距，所以还能听出一些立体声效果。可能是最近听了太多智能音箱的缘故，听到SoundDock II 后突然有一种「这样才对嘛」的感觉哈哈。
我找了几款同价位的智能音箱对比下，大家可以听下声音风格的不同（可能有点不太公平，毕竟Bose当年也卖一千多，大家听个乐吧）：
 
和一代 SoundDock 相比，SoundDock II 还支持 3.5mm 音频输入，我之前买的一个 AirPort Express（A1264） 就派上用场了。

AirPort Express是苹果已经停产的路由器，它长得就像是一个MacBook电源，除了基础的网…]]></summary>

Amazing though it may seem, we each experience the world differently. That's one reality with over 6 billion interpretations. Many of us use computers to broaden our experience of the world, but a computer is part of reality and so if you experience reality without, for instance, vision or sound, then you also experience a computer without vision or sound (or whatever your unique experience might be.) As humans, we don't quite have the power to experience the world the way somebody does. We can mimic some of the surface-level things (I can close my eyes to mimic blindness, for example) but it's only an imitation, without history, context, or urgency. As a …]]></summary>

BPF is a system to help in network traffic analysis. The later eBPF system extends classic BPF to improve the programmability of the Linux kernel in different areas, such as network filtering, function hooking, and so on. Thanks to its register-based virtual machine, which is embedded in the kernel, eBPF can execute programs written with a restricted C language without needing to recompile the kernel or load a modul…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[写在正文之前

我不希望你在没有判断的情况下全盘接受这篇文章的概念，所以请你在阅读的时候保持警觉。
文章里会涉及大量概念，由于和平时的使用方式有很大区别又想要便于理解，我用「」做了区分，如果你不习惯，请谅解。
另，最近住的地方开始降温了，我心情很好，希望你也有个好心情。

概念的第一个特征，非均质性
我想和你聊聊「概念」，准确地说，聊聊「概念」的两个特性。
第一个是非均质性。鉴于这个词我平时不常用，我觉得你应该也不太熟悉它。那你可以这么理解——你无法用「是」来说明一个概念。或者更直白一些，你无法对一个概念下一个准确的定义。
有些例子可以帮你理解这句话。你现在在脑子里随便选一个词，然后挑几本不同的字典查一下，或者网上找字典也可以。我作个假设，你大概会发现每本字典的解释都有一些差异，如果是纸质的字典，甚至同一字典不同的版本对同一个词的解释也有可能不一样。
所以你觉得发生了什么事？明明是同一个词，为什么不同的字典会有不同的解释？
或者我们可以举个更生活化的例子，包子。我不了解你的口味，但我猜你应该知道包子。于是，包子是什么？
就我个人而言，这大概是早餐偶尔会吃的，在早餐店一般都有的，从蒸笼里拿出来的，圆圆白白的，松松软软的，里面有馅的那个东西。
但是，你可能会有不同的意见。

包子必须在早餐店里才有吗？自己在家做过包子的人肯定也不少吧？
包子必须早餐吃吗？中午或者晚上甚至当零食解馋吃包子的人应该也有吧？
包子必须是圆的吗？做得稍微长一点，稍微三角形一点也有吧？
包子必须是白色的吗？黑麦包子应该也能找得到吧？

所以，到最后你可能会不认同我的想法。那么，包子是什么？我找到了度娘给的包子的定义。

包子，指用发面皮包馅蒸成的食品。

这当然比我给出的答案要准确了不少，但我觉得还有「一点点」不准确。

比如，你应该吃过一种生煎的包子吧？烤包子可能少一点，但也有，我还听说过油炸包子，虽然…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debian 终于开始考虑将非自由固件纳入一般决议中了。那么，将会如何呢？




由于其稳定性和新功能之间的平衡的做法，Debian 是最受欢迎的 Linux 发行版之一。

但是，它并没有配备任何非自由固件。

对于想在新硬件上使用 Debian 的用户来说，这已经成为一个问题。

大多数最新的设备和配置都需要非自由固件来使其工作，这包括 Wi-Fi、图形显示等等。

为了解决这个问题，前 Debian 项目负责人、开发者 Steve McIntyre 已经对此积极讨论了一段时间。最近在 DebConf 22 会议上，正如 Geeker's Digest 所发现的那样，Steve 谈到了修复固件的混乱局面，更好地向用户和开发者表明了这一点。

现在社区中讨论的进展是，看起来 Debian 已经启动了一项一般决议，让其利益相关者投票决定如何处理非自由固件的问题。

Debian 的一般决议提案

这个一般决议案有四个提案（LCTT 译注：原文和官方提案说明不够清晰，我根据理解重新梳理了）：


提案 A：改变原有的官方镜像集（安装镜像和实况镜像），Debian 将在官方镜像中包含非自由固件包。包含的固件将在检测到需求时默认启用。然而，它也将包括让用户在启动时禁用的方法。（截止本文发表时的提案支持人数：17）

提案 B：不改变原有的镜像集，保留原来的不包含非自由固件的镜像，另外单独提供包含非自由固件的官方镜像。新的镜像下载链接将更醒目以方便新用户找到它们，而原来的镜像的视觉优先级将变低。（截止本文发表时的提案支持人数：10）

提案 C：和提案 B 类似，在用户下载不包含自由固件的镜像时，提醒他们还有包含非自由固件的镜像可供下载。（截止本文发表时的提案支持人数：6）

提案 D：继续遵守《Debian 社会契约Debian Social Contract》第 1 节和第 5 节的精神，继续保持现状，不在 Debian 中包含任何非自由软件，但支持它们的使用，并欢迎其他人分发这样的作品。（截止本文发表时的提案支持人数：6）


这些是一些有趣的建议。我认为提案 A 对所有人都很方便，同时给高级用户禁用非自由固件的机会。

你可以在 官方网页 中了解更多关于一般决议的信息。

你怎么看？

将非自由固件纳入官方发行版中

至于目前的情况，你可以找到带有非自由固件的“非官方”的 Debian 镜像。

然而，并不是每个用户都知道它，即使它在 Debian 的下载页面上被宣传，“非官方”的说法也不会让用户比推荐的镜像更喜欢。

此外，当用户可以选择任何基于 Ubuntu 的发行版或 Ubuntu 作为替代品时，期望他们安装非自由固件是违反直觉的。

不仅仅限于这些问题，Steve 在他的 博客 中还提到了其他一些问题，包括：


维护独立的非自由镜像是很耗时的。

由于缺乏非自由固件，许多用户不喜欢官方镜像。


那么，你认为 Debian 的一般决议的投票结果是什么？一个单独的介质镜像？还是把它包括在官方镜像中？

大家好，我是 StaySleep 的作者八层夹心奥利奥。
今年八月份，我在 App Store 上线了我的第一款 app，StaySleep。在发布之初的前三天，它一度登上了 App Store 健康健美分区的 Top 100，那几天我的社交平台也被如潮水一般的反馈、建议给淹没了，而在上周四，我惊喜地发现我的 app 出现在了 App Store 的每周编辑推荐位。趁着八月底暑假的最后几天，我想在少数派和各位朋友聊一聊 StaySleep 与我的故事。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canonical 将 Linux 游戏组件 Snap 化

Canonical 的工程师正在开发 GameMode Snap。GameMode 是 Feral 的守护程序，能够在游戏启动时自动将 CPU 频率调节器设置为性能模式，并在退出游戏后将其恢复到先前的默认值。GameMode 已经支持在 Flatpak 容器化环境中运行，而现在他们正在将其过渡到 Snap。GameMode 作为一个 Debian 软件包在 Ubuntu 上已经有一段时间了，甚至是默认安装的。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：Canonical 正在孜孜不倦的将各种重要应用切换到 Snap，但是感觉 Snap 一直没有得到人们的喜爱。尤其是中国没有 Snap 商店的镜像，使用起来更是难受。




谷歌悬赏开源供应链安全漏洞

谷歌推出了一项新的漏洞奖励计划，向发现其开源软件或其软件所基于的构建模块中的安全漏洞的研究人员支付报酬。它将为 Angular、GoLang 和 Fuchsia 等项目中的漏洞或这些项目代码库中包含的第三方依赖的漏洞的信息支付最高超过三万美元的奖金。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：虽然对谷歌来说，自己的软件安全很重要，但是来自开源供应链上的风险可能会导致意料之外的更大风险。




亚马逊和谷歌指责微软云计算的垄断行为

亚马逊和谷歌发表声明，指责微软作出的最新软件业务调整将阻碍客户转移到云计算竞争平台，影响市场公平竞争。周一，微软宣布了一系列包括软件授权政策在内的调整，新政策将会在 10 月 1 日开始生效，微软声称，新政策将有利于云计算市场的玩家更好的竞争。然而，微软宣布的软件授权政策调整中，排除了亚马逊、谷歌、阿里巴巴和微软自己的云服务。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：说实话没太看明白，微软这不是连自家的云也限制了嘛。另外，现在的公有云挣扎在锁定和避免锁定之间，公有云理应是不锁定的，但是大的云服务商总想能锁定一些比较好。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[又一个 Markdown 编辑器？我们见的 Markdown 编辑器还少吗？

我明白你的感受，如果你是个 Markdown 爱好者，你可能已经用过很多 Markdown 编辑器了，比如 Joplin 和 Zettlr。但如果你不是的话，你可能根本就不在乎。

Markdown 是一个非常好的标记语言，特别是对那些在网络上写作的人来说。我不想在这里讲太多细节，但如果你有兴趣的话，我们有一篇 非常棒的 Markdown 初学者教程。

这次我想推荐给你（另一个）Markdown 编辑器，它叫 Marktext，并且它是用 Electron 制作的（我们都明白这什么意思，先别急着埋怨我）。

我发现这将是一个很完美的编辑器。它很漂亮，而它运行起来也一样棒。下面是我这几天来的使用体验。

Marktext: 人人可用的 Markdown 编辑器

尽管我很讨厌 Electron 框架，但不得不承认基于 Electron 的应用都有一个干净、现代的界面。



我更喜欢深色模式主题，除此之外官方还提供了五种其它主题。



打开软件你就可以立刻进行写作，如果你不记得某个语法了，那也没有问题，输入 @ 就可以得到语法提示，如：


标题

分隔线

表格

Latex 数学公式

HTML 块

代码块

引用

列表

检查清单

用 Vega-lite.js、Flowchart.js、js-sequence-diagrams 和 PlantUML 制作的图表




选中文本你会得到一个格式选项框，来改变文本为粗体、斜体、下划线、删除线等。你也可以用黄色背景高亮文本、转换为内联代码、内联公式或插入超链接。



Marktext 也支持图片。我们都知道图片不是 Markdown 文件的一部分，它们是外部元素，但是你可以选择将图片…]]></summary>

In this series, I'm developing several scripts to help in cleaning up my music collection. In the last article I wrote and tested a Groovy script to clean up the motley assembly of tag fields. In this article, I'll separate the framework I've been using into a separate class and then write a test program to exercise it.
Install Java and Groovy
Groovy is based on Java and requires a Java installation. Both a recent and decent version of Java and Groovy might be in your Linux distribution's repositories. Groovy can also be installed following the instructions on the Groovy homepage. A nice alternative for Linux users is SDKMan, which can be used to get multi…]]></summary>

To be an effective leader in an open source community, you need a lot of information. How do I know who the most active members in my community are? Which companies are making the most contributions? Which contributors are drifting away and becoming inactive? Who in the community is knowledgeable about a specific topic?
These were just a few of the questions I had when I started leading the Mautic community at Acquia. But the problem was not a shortage of information. On the contrary, there were so many places our community interacted and so many things to track that I was drowning in data. I could access plenty of data sources, but they were not …]]></summary>

        <id>https://linux.cn/article-14985-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</id>
        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-14985-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-08-31T04:03:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME 43 即将到来。下面是你可以期待在该版本中出现的功能。




GNOME 43 将于 2022 年 9 月 21 日发布。截至目前，GNOME 43 的测试版已经可供测试。

我们在 GNOME 43 测试版中发现的功能和变化应该随着最终版本的发布而到来。

那么，哪些是你最值得期待的 GNOME 43 功能呢？

让我们来看看一些关键的变化。

这个列表集中在视觉/交互式变化上。关于技术变化的完整列表，你可以参考文章底部链接的更新日志。

1、改造了快速设置



GNOME 桌面菜单位于右上角，你可以在这里快速调整音量、访问网络连接，以及开/关电脑，在这个版本中它终于得到了视觉上的更新。

现在，它看起来更像是安卓的快速切换栏，这应该会增强用户体验，同时减少一些多余的点击。



你不需要前往设置来打开深色模式和夜光。新的快速切换菜单就可以让你可以访问到它们。

此外，像选择 Wi-Fi 网络和改变音频设备这样的事情比以前更容易做到。

2、对 Nautilus 文件管理器的改变

虽然我们已经在之前的报道中提到了 GNOME 43 中对 Nautilus 最重要的改变。


GNOME 43 中 Nautilus 文件管理器的 6 个新变化


有几件事值得再次重申。其中一些包括：


使用 GTK 4 的全新外观。

拖动和选择文件的能力（橡皮筋选择）。

紧凑窗口的自适应视图。

新的文件上下文菜单。




总的来说，在 GNOME 43 中，你会发现 Nautilus 文件管理器有了一些视觉上的调整，并有动画的细微改进。

你可以点击每一个选项，访问目录的属性等等来探索其中的差异。它应该感觉更直观一些。

3、设备安全信息



我们之前报道过 GNOME 会在你禁用安全启动时显示警告。


安全启动已被禁用？ GNOME将很快向您发出警告！


你会在你的闪屏和锁屏中看到这个警告。

GNOME 的设置菜单也有一个新的 “设备安全” 选项，在这里你可以看到安全启动状态和其他重要信息，比如：


TPM

英特尔 BootGuard

IOMMU 保护


4、GNOME Web 的扩展支持



GNOME Web 在每次更新都会变得更好一些。有了 Web 扩展的支持，它成为了一个有吸引力的选择，可以取代你的日常使用的浏览器。


有了扩展，GNOME Web 正慢慢成为桌面 Linux 上一个有吸引力的选择


在写这篇文章的时候，该支持仍然是 实验性的，你必须得手动安装扩展。

对于初学者来说，你可以在 Mozilla Firefox 附加组件门户上下载 .xpi 扩展文件。

5、GNOME 软件中心的改进

GNOME 的软件中心目前的体验并不是很好。

虽然它在提供额外信息方面有所改进，但仍有改进的余地。



在 GNOME 43 中，你可以了解到更多关于 Flatpak 应用程序所需的权限。而且，你还可以看到一个 “其他应用程序” 部分，以寻找同一开发者的其它应用程序。

此外，软件包来源的显示方式也有了细微的视觉调整。



附加：新的墙纸

你会得到新的默认壁纸，有深色和浅色的变体。下面是深色壁纸背景的样子：



而这是浅色版本：



除了主要的亮点之外，其他一些变化包括：


Adwaita 图标主题更新。

GNOME 应用程序的性能改进。

各种代码的清理。

对日历的改进。

改良了“关于”窗口。


关于完整的技术细节，你可以参考 GNOME 43 测试版更新日志。

总的来说，GNOME 43 在很大程度上注重提高可用性和用户体验。

最初还计划了一些有趣的功能，但它们没有进入 GNOME 43。也许，GNOME 44 会包括这些？


这里是开发者为 GNOME 43 规划的内容


你对 GNOME 43 的功能有何看法？请在下面的评论中告诉我们你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[引言
许久没有静下来心来玩一款游戏了，前这几日宅在家里，体验了一下《光·遇》，而又联想到许多以前玩过的游戏，有感而发，遂就此文。由于专业的关系，本科学教育学时读过一些心理学，硕士念的也是中国哲学，因此本文会较为深入地去分析游戏的价值与影响，对游戏玩法、交互体验、设计美学的分析会稍少。本文将主要以美学的角度来赏析《光·遇》的美术风格，以心理学的角度去分析《光·遇》的核心玩法，以解释学的视角来诠释《光·遇》的禅意社交，最后以存在主义的核心价值作为文章收尾。虽以《光·遇》为始，但最后分析的也不仅仅是《光·遇》。综上，文章整体脉络变构成了“四位一体”的第九艺术分析。

美术风格：意象、自由、审美价值
意象
意象是审美中“美”本身，是美之本体。在美学的演化中，如果说有一个概念关注美学本身，那就是意象。《光·遇》中光怪陆离的风景意象如同卡尔维诺的《看不见的城市》那样，是现实与心中的那些虚构之城，交相辉映，轮回交替，更像是一场灵魂的旅行，带着思索穿梭于各个城市之间。
所谓意象，由“意”与“象”构成，“意”即诗意，而“象”并不只是指具象，也包括想象。我们先来看看其中之”象“。想象，是假定与自由的象征，假定了，感情才有自由。反过来说，若《光·遇》中场景如实反映生活，不存在那些会发光的蝴蝶、会漂浮在空中的水母、会上天如海的鲲鹏、漂浮在空中的城市，而仅是拘泥于现实生活中存在的物体，那么没有想象，感情就没有自由，也就没有诗意了。所以我们说，艺术的精致，就在于是一种情感、联想、语言的精致。作为第九艺术的游戏，《光·遇》将这种艺术的精致发挥的淋漓精致。

如果说想象是美学的灵魂，那么诗意是美学的境界。意象之中不但有极其精炼的“象”，而且有极其独特的“意”。所谓意境，不仅仅是意象群落之间的建构，而是意象与意象之间沿着意脉延伸发展而出的那般足以表达诗意的境界。
以《光·遇》之中的雨林来看，整体意象包括了绵…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debian 修改了 Chromium 的默认搜索引擎

虽然 Firefox 仍然是 Debian 的默认浏览器，但很多 Linux 用户都会安装 Chrome 浏览器的开源上游 Chromium 浏览器。早些时候，在 Debian 中提供的 Chromium 使用谷歌作为默认搜索引擎。最近，Debian 发布公告称，“由于隐私原因，将默认搜索引擎改为 DuckDuckGo”。这个决定并不是匆忙做出的，因为这个提议是在两年前提出的，只是近日才得以通过。

法国用 AI 发现未申报的私人游泳池，开出千万欧元账单

因为建造游泳池能提高房价，意味着更高的财产税，根据法国法律，业主需要申报其建造的游泳池。2020 年法国有逾 320 万个私人游泳池，新冠疫情期间愈来愈多的人在家办公，游泳池的安装量也进一步激增。法国税务部门使用由谷歌等公司开发的 AI 软件，可以在航拍图像上识别游泳池，并与土地登记数据库进行交叉检查。结果发现了超过 2 万个未申报的私人游泳池，这些业主将收到总额约为 1000 万欧元的账单。

老王点评：这就是 AI 的生财之道，早晚有一天，AI 会把人拿捏的死死的。




Web3 DNS 供应商可能失去其域名

ENS 是一种运行在以太坊上的域名服务，用于在 Web3 中便捷地访问各种地址。但是如果想在互联网上访问它，通常需要一种特别的 DNS 服务商，其中 eth.link 是使用最多的一个。但是，该域名的所有者因故入狱，因此这个域名没有办法续费，面临过期。eth.link 于 7 月 26 日到期，并将于 9 月 5 日被域名注册商收回，届时它将可能被抢注并用于恶意用途。在试图由其他人替代续费，而被域名注册商拒绝之后，ENS DAO 已经建议用户使用另外一个 eth.limo 域名作为替代。


消息来源：Coindesk



老王点评：这就很不 Web3，一个常用的服务依赖于某个具体的人。事实上，现在以“去中心化”为目标的的 Web3 的基础设施，几乎都是由中心化的人或组织控制的。]]></summary>

如果说起音箱，那么一起会想到SONY、BOSE、JBL、雅马哈、哈曼卡顿这些品牌，毕竟他们已在国内深耕多年，有着相当大的品牌影响力和听众基础。

但如果有深入了解音频产品的话，必然或多或少会听到过PSB保罗巴顿这个品牌。毕竟PSB保罗巴顿也是一个拥有着50年历史的经典音响品牌，在国外的音频电子消费品市场中有着举足轻重的地位，其推出的Synchrony T600就是CES 2022唯一获奖的被动式音箱，也是当前PSB保罗巴顿的旗舰级音箱产品。

之所以PSB保罗巴顿在国内会小众，主要原因还是以前的购买途径只能海淘或代购，例如我看中的一套PSB Alpha系列低音炮，也只能求助于亚马逊，可想而知是有多麻烦。现今总算在国内上市，在某猫和某东都有了正规购买途径，售后和品质都有了保障。
也正因PSB保罗巴顿在某猫上的入驻，才让我有机会将PSB Alpha AM3这对「宝藏」书架音箱收入囊中，接下来咱们就品一下这对箱子的味道。

声音的变化
观影效果如何？

在观影方面建议将PSB Alpha AM3书架音箱切换到对话模式或者WideSound Plus模式，前者突出人声部分，后者是加强人声的同时也扩展声场，具体可以视影片的类型而定。
例如在回顾复联4时，就可以考虑优先启用WideSound Plus模式。在此模式下，场面感更宏大，双方互冲时更加激动人心，低音效果爆棚，各种爆炸声、轰鸣声在我面前炸裂，临场感相当赞。在场面混乱低音效果较足的情况下，人物间的对白依旧能保持清晰，具有很好的方位感。

而在一些以对白叙事为主的影片中，启用对话模式会更优。此时的人物对白会更突出，情绪感动细节被放大，可以更好地展现人物的内在情绪，让观者更容易被带入至影片的情绪中。

常规音乐播放体验

提到音乐播放，那么不得不拿出我CD随身听。这是17年前的产物，应该算是当年SONY发布的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[疑问
《卡片笔记写作法》(How to Take Smart Notes) 一书的热销，和一系列双链笔记的出现，使得这种更为「现代化」的笔记方式显得非常酷。最近看文章和刷视频，总能遇到有作者感慨对该方法「相见恨晚」，随后进行一番解读。
很多读者和观众看后，会羡慕不已，然后给这些内容点赞。但是，你有没有想过，卡片笔记写作法为什么管用？如何有效发挥作用？为什么很多人高呼「过瘾」，而另一些人嗤之以鼻呢？
我最近重读《福格行为模型》，对这个问题有了新的感悟。故写作本文为你分享。
动机
在我看来，卡片笔记和传统写作 (胸怀锦绣，下笔千言，甚至滔滔不绝) 最大的区别，在于对普通人写作「动机」这个事儿是不是有合理的预判。
很多人会购买健身房的年卡，然后很快就不再去了。这一笔进项，对于许多健身房来说，足够可观，且喜闻乐见。有趣的是，即便很多人听说过类似的故事，也不能抵御自己「付费购买健身年卡」的冲动。因为他们坚信，自己有充分的动机，会坚持健身。那些意志不坚定，导致花冤枉钱的事儿，一定不会出现在自己身上。
这事儿当然不止体现在健身房，你耳熟能详的例子应该还包括购买软件的年度会员功能订阅等。甚至，因为有时候促销，人们会一口气买它若干年的。
为什么呢？
因为不止一项研究的科学证据显示，人们会显著高估自己高水平动机的持续性。
而实际情况则不然。动机并不会一直悬空在那里，而是会受到很多因素的影响来波动。换句话说，你无法指望动机是个「永动机」 ，只做工不耗能。既然要耗能，原料之一便叫做「鸡血」。所以你会常听说一种叫做「打鸡血」或者「画大饼」的行为。你不要嘲笑这种行为很 low ，对于某些人来说，它非常有效且必要。

回到我们的主题（写作）。普通人会对自己的写作动机有过高的预期。例如说从今天开始，每天一千字，一个月搞定硕士毕业论文；或者每天 500 字，半年搞定一本小说……
实际上，几乎没有人能够保障这…]]></summary>

Lately, I've been looking at how Groovy streamlines Java. In this series, I'm developing several scripts to help in cleaning up my music collection. In my last article, I used the framework developed previously to create a list of unique file names and counts of occurrences of those file names in the music collection directory. I then used the Linux find command to get rid of files I didn't want.
In this article, I demonstrate a Groovy script to clean up the motley assembly of tag fields.
WARNING: This script alters music tags, so it is vital that you make a backup of the music collection you test your code on.

When someone needs to share their screen with you, or you need to share your screen with someone else, you have several options to choose from. Video conferencing software, like the open source Jitsi web app, and while we call that "screen sharing," it's really presenting. You're presenting your screen to others, but they can't interact with it. Sometimes you actually want to share your screen and your mouse cursor with a trusted friend or colleague, and the tool for that is VNC (Virtual Network Computing), and it's built into your Linux desktop.
In any screen sharing scenario, there are two computers and possibly two users. For that reason, this article has two p…]]></summary>

In this series, I'm developing several scripts to help in cleaning up my music collection. In the last article, we used the framework created for analyzing the directory and sub-directories of music files, checking to make sure each album has a cover.jpg file and recording any other files that aren't FLAC, MP3, or OGG.
I uncovered a few files that can obviously be deleted—I see the odd foo lying around—and a bunch of PDFs, PNGs, and JPGs that are album art. With that in mind, and thinking about the cruft removal task, I offer an improved script that uses a Groovy map to record file names and counts of their occurrences and print that in CSV form…]]></summary>

When you have a lot of related files, it's sometimes easier to treat them as a single object rather than 3 or 20 or 100 unique files. There are fewer clicks involved, for instance, when you email one file compared to the mouse work required to email 30 separate files. This quandary was solved decades ago when programmers invented a way to create an archive, and so the tar command was born (the name stands for tape archive because back then, files were saved to magnetic tape.) Today tar remains a useful way to bundle files together, whether it's to compress them so they take up less space on your drive, to make it easier to deal with lots of files, or to logically group…]]></summary>

在2022年初的时候，我制作发布了自己的第一款苹果平台应用 3x3
这是一款采用极简主义设计风格（参考Windows Phone）的时间管理应用
在此之前，我在少数派上看到很多朋友都在用自己的方式结合市面上的工具来搭建自己的时间管理体系
其中有一些关键词，比如间歇式日记、柳比歇夫时间记录法、双链等
其中一些理念，让我觉得和 3x3 的理念很类似，所以也是经过半年多的迭代完善后，想向各位介绍这款工具
我自己不太会写文章，所以这篇文章的内容可能会比较简单
我希望能分享一下我为什么要做这个软件以及分享我自己和一些用户的使用体验
3x3 的理念
首先我想分享一段话，这正是 3x3 核心理念：dots will somehow connect in your future

You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.

3x3 可以轻松的记录日常的时间线，可以关联每日、周、月、年、甚至人生的待办或者标签，并且待办之间可以进行双向链接
做3x3的想法就是，过了很多年之后，我还可以方便的找到当天做过有意义的事情
然后可以将所有事情串联起来，比如我学习一样事情，阅读一本书，可以清晰的知道每个阶段的过程，甚至你可以制作你自己的10000小时计划
3x3 的设计想法在 2018 年初，就有了，当时我还做了一个简单的网页，它…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 WWDC22 上，Apple 发布 iOS 16 的时候，公布了一个功能叫实时活动，并向开发者开放 Live Activities API。

那么什么实时活动呢？
实时活动是一种新的交互式消息通知，用户可以在 iPhone 的锁屏界面看到事件的实时更新。比如球赛的比分、打车或订餐的订单状态、运动锻炼的实时数据等。这种消息通知形式允许开发者在实时活动期间更新单个交互式通知，而不是每次有状态更新时都发送新通知。通过减少发送的通知数量，同时使信息更易于访问。
Uber海外版团队设计的实时活动界面
Apple 在 iOS 16 开发者测试版 Beta 4 首次向开发者提供 ActivityKit 开发套件，首次在真机实装，随后在 Beta 6 和 Beta 7 并没有在真机实装实时活动功能。开发者目前只能在模拟器测试这项功能，或者降级回 Beta 4 或 Beta 5。Apple 在开发者网站也明确表示实时活动不会在首个 iOS16 正式版推出，而是在今年晚些时候的正式版突出。下图是模仿目前已有的原神安卓小组件、iOS 小组件做的实时活动版小组件。到了 8 月 16 日一大早用手机更新 Beta 6 之后，手机就不能运行和测试实时活动了，随后也看到其他开发者反馈实时活动在 Beta 6 版本没有实装。本文后面的截图只能在模拟器截取了，但模拟器不能更改壁纸，只有黑色背景。
Xcode真机调试报错ActivityKit没实装
实时活动界面部分是小组件扩展，开发者使用 WidgetKit 功能和 SwiftUI 编写界面布局，ActivityKit 是处理配置、启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动是一种消息通知，是一种可以自定义界面布局和更新状态的消息通知。下图是普通类型的消息通知，或许以后能看到换了界面布局的降雨提醒。
普通的消息通知类型
实时活动要求和限制
与小组件不同的是，小组件是通过时间线机制更新界面数据，实时活动是通过远程推送或 ActivityKit 从主应用程序来启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动无法访问网络或接收位置更新，下图网络请求图片失败。

ActivityKit 更新和远程推送通知更新的更新动态数据大小不能超过 4KB。
实时活动界面不能包含可交互元素，例如按钮和 WebView。当用户点击实时活动界面，将会打开主应用程序。
自定义实时活动的用户界面时，系统会忽略任何自定义动画，但可以使用系统自带的时间文本动画，当实时活动的动态内容发生变化时，系统会执行一些动画。文本视图通过模糊的内容过渡动画内容变化，系统为图像和 SF Symbols 符号动画内容过渡，根据内容或状态更改从用户界面添加或删除视图，视图会淡入淡出。
系统自带的时间文本动画系统为图像内容变化作出的动画效果
在开发者网站的描述中，如果实时活动的高度超过 160，系统可能会截断它。在实际测试中，实时活动界面最小高度为 64，最大高度可以达到 220。目前实时活动功能还不是正式的版本，有可能在之后的测试版本会有改变。

当用户在 App 首次启动时，点击允许应用程序发送通知时，就代表允许 App 发送实时活动通知，不允许则不会收到实时活动的通知。之后在系统设置 - 对应的 App -实时活动，可以关闭/开启实时活动权限。
实时活动权限位置
实时活动有 4 种活动状态，分别是：等待中、正在进行、成功、失败
实时活动在锁屏界面显示的时候，用户可以左划，点击清除按钮将其清除。用户没有清除的情况下，实时活动最多可以处于活动状态 8 小时，如果用户或应用程序尚未结束活动状态，系统会自动结束它。在此结束状态下，实时活动会在锁定屏幕上最多保留 4 个小时，最后系统会将其删除。

目前实时活动功能还在测试状态，开发者们还在为他们的 App 设计和测试这一项功能，下图是收集几款目前在测试中的实时活动的例子。
一些例子展示
关于实时活动这一功能的一些设想。在这个功能正式上线后，除了官方和大部分媒体提到的比赛比分、运动训练状态、行程状态、订单状态等这些功能以外，我们或许还可以看到这些功能：某餐饮 App 提醒你周四中午吃啥；原神体力、宝钱、参量质变仪到点提示上线领取；购物平台推送提醒商品抢购即将开启、正在抢购还剩余 69 件并且在不断减少等之类的功能。

以上就是关于实时活动这个功能的一些介绍和想法。之前的一篇锁屏天气的文章和视频会有评论说解锁在桌面小组件就能看到天气了啊，左划负一屏添加小组件就能看到天气了啊。不过对于我这种手机懒得解锁的用户来说，对于锁屏实时活动这个功能是非常期待的。大家对于实时活动这个系统特性及功能有什么想法和期待呢？]]></summary>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

作者免责和警示信息：我国目前现行的法律法规对代餐类产品并无严格的规范和限制，在选择代餐产品时请务必慎重。本文作者与文中出现的任何品牌（或其竞争对手）均无利益关联，亦不为文中出现的任何品牌做推荐或背书。有关长期使用代餐的风险和副作用的研究证据仍然不充分，有代谢相关疾病或慢性肝、肾疾病的人士在使用代餐产品前务必征得医生许可。孕妇、哺乳期妇女、婴幼儿、儿童、老人等人群如无特殊需要，最好不食用代餐食品。

根据中国营养学会发布的《代餐食品》团体标准，代餐食品被定义为「为了满足成年人控制体重期间一餐或两餐的营养需要，专门加工配制而成的控制能量食品」。有一些代餐食品能够完全替代一餐的全部正常食物，另一些则只能替代部分正常食物。后者一般称为「部分代餐食品」。
为了便于理解、简化讨论，下文中对完全代餐和部分代餐食品将不做专门区分。
代餐能代替三餐吗？
常见的两个代餐使用场景一是「不想 / 不能 / 不愿意做饭」，另一是「减脂和 / 或体重控制」。有关前者的讨论已有不少。感兴趣的读者可移步阅读下列一些文章。
  
以代餐完全取代三餐有一个前提，就是你选择的产品应该成分可靠、营养全面、配比合理。不过很遗憾，常规的商业代餐产品如 Soylent 或若饭都很难达到这个要求。Soylent 液体版（每瓶 414 毫升，提供 400 千卡热量）的碳水、蛋白质和脂肪供能比为 35%-19%-46%，若饭的供能比之类似。根据《中国居民膳食营养素参考摄入量（2017 年发布）》，18-60 岁成年人每日通过脂肪摄入的热量占比不应超过 30%，碳水化合物的供能比最低…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在我看来，Nreal Air 眼镜是一个非常「简单」、非常「聪明」的产品
包装大全套
拿到 Nreal Air 有几天时间了，老实讲等快递到那几天是很激动的，这不是我第一次使用 Nreal 眼镜了，在 2019 年的时候，我非常有幸去北京拜访过 Nreal，期间短暂的体验过 Nreal Air 的前身，当时的 demo 版本已经非常接近现在的样子，给我留下了非常深刻的印象。
如今，在我体验了一段时间，新鲜感消失之后，重新审视这个产品时，我觉得他们做了一些非常漂亮的取舍，得以让 Nreal Air 能够脱离小众，走向大众的视野。这在我的印象当中，可能是这个品类的第一次。并且在苹果发布他们的 AR 眼镜之前，分析一下 Nreal 的每一个选择背后的原因，想想苹果在面对取舍时会怎么选择，这是一个非常好的参照。

取舍
从用户端的需求来说，其实第一个选择非常简单：AR 眼镜到底能干什么？或者说我期望用户能用 AR 眼镜来做什么？
这个问题是简单的，但要回答清楚也是困难的。做产品定义时，产品经理大可以做一些「元宇宙」式的幻想：我希望 AR 眼镜是信息的入口，用户可以活在里面。这个回答可能没错，但是稍微认清一些现实的话，做到这一步是要有非常多的前提的，「元宇宙」里面的内容谁来填充？芯片是否具备这么高的算力能够渲染出丰富的画面？光机是不是能把这些画面精细的显示出来？这几个灵魂拷问可能就连产业巨头都只能兼顾 1-2 个，更别提 Nreal 只是一个 2017 年成立的创业公司了。
所以结合现实，他们的答案是，优先把画面显示好，内容生态寻求合作伙伴补充。
在这个答案的背后，就是他们两个最重要产品取舍：
1. 不在眼镜里集成计算模块和电池，将计算的部分放进用户固有设备中，如手机、平板。
2. 不做无线投屏，采用有线链接，保证稳定性和低延迟

这么选择一个重要的好处就是成本直接少一大块，反映到实…]]></summary>

背景
成为少数派 Matrix 作者已经两年有余。回想起在少数派发表的第一篇文章，也是因为征文活动「无限桌面」有感而发，简单介绍了一下当时身在国内，日夜颠倒网课学习时的桌面布置。两年过去了，我已经回到了美国，也从当时的学校毕业，进入到新的学校，开启了人生的一个新阶段。 
新闻传媒，英文名叫做「Journalism」，是一门专门学习新闻报道和写作的学科。而除了学校里开设的各类理论和实践课之外，最好的学习方法就是平时的阅读积累。在我将新闻传媒定为自己学习的方向之后，我便开始有意识地通过各种渠道获取内容，加深自己对于新闻事件的理解，同时也学习职业记者们的写作风格。几年下来，我也有了一套独属于自己的系统。这次少数派的征文主题是「数字文具盒」，那我也趁这个机会，聊一聊自己作为一个新闻传媒系的学生，是如何使用数字工具来搭建自己的阅读和写作系统的。
按照工具和媒体的性质，我把自己的「数字文具盒」简单分为四个步骤：获取内容，收集内容，处理内容，以及产出内容。
我的阅读与写作系统的简单流程图
获取内容
阅读理解新闻的第一步，当然是要找到优质的信息渠道。我目前常用的渠道主要有四个：传统媒体，播客，书籍，以及社交媒体。
传统媒体，指的就是规模大，存在时间久，以报道新闻为主要目的的媒体。我订阅的传统媒体有三家：纽约时报 New York Times，华尔街日报 The Wall Street Journal， 以及大西洋杂志 The Atlantic。 纽约时报作为美国发行量最大的报纸之一，文章质量有一定的保证，并且汇集了许多美国最知名的专栏作家。我每天都会阅读它的早间资讯 Morning Briefing 和 On Politics 两份 newsletter。但因为它的受众主要是美国的自由派人士，文章导向非常明显。而华尔街日报专注于商务人士，文章也偏向保守。大西…]]></summary>

In this series, I'm developing several scripts to help in cleaning up my music collection. In the last article, I used the framework I created for analyzing the directory and sub-directories of music files and carried out the analysis with the fine open source JAudiotagger library to analyze the tags of the music files in the music directory and subdirectories. In this article, I will do a simpler job:
Use the framework we created in Part 1
Make sure each album directory has a cover.jpg class
Make a note of any other files in the album directory that aren't FLAC, MP3 or OGG.
Music and metadata

背景
读博士的这些年，我每天都在获取各式各样的知识。大到学术论文，小到快捷指令的配置教程，每份知识都可能在未来某个时刻派上用场。我根据自己的习惯和需求建立了一套工作流，用来记录以及内化各类知识。我的目标是形成自己的个人数据库，方便未来随时的调用。
知识有不同的特点，调用场景也各不相同。下面的表格展示了我对知识的理解以及相应的分类。在这篇文章里，我将针对每个类型，介绍了我记录（和内化）这些知识的经验，以及使用到的工具。


知识类型知识特点例子
学术研究格式固定，密度高，需要原文阅读学术论文，演讲
系统性知识内容多，密度低，自上而下结构大学课程，教科书，出版书籍
非系统性知识碎片化知识，自下而上结构CSDN，网络文章，教学/科普 视频
信息只需记录，不需整理做饭教学视频，服务器配置流程代码


1. 学术研究
首先要讨论的是学术研究类的知识，代表的例子就是学术论文。可能是因为阅读论文都需要花费巨大的精力而且经常会查阅，我通常会对阅读过论文有印象。即便不一定记得所有的细节，我还是很容易就能检索到，并重新阅读。
学术论文这一类知识有三个特点：

知识密度高：文章内容很浓缩，比较难再二次总结。未来通常需要再查阅论文的时候大概率还是得阅读原文。
格式固定：学术论文通常都会有 Abstract 来记录文章梗概。理工科的论文经常会有 Related Work, Methodology 和 Results 这些章节。第一次阅读难度较大，但理解以后再次阅读的难度不大，信息获取容易。
上下文重要：随意从论文中抽出来某一段文字或者配图，不一定很好理解。通常需要结合上下文才好理解。

由于查阅论文的大多需要阅读原文，所以我不会专门用笔记 app 给论文记笔记。我会把笔记直接记在论文 PDF 上。

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。 

最近，我正在研究使用 Obsidian，想看看大名鼎鼎的「卡片盒笔记法」是否真的能解决我读书过目就忘的困扰。不过困扰还不知道能不能解决，我就发现了新的问题。
Obsidian 有许多优点，其中一个就是自带社区主题库，用户可以随意更换样式，不再天天看千篇一律的外观。然而，尽管社区主题库里有很多主题样式，说实话，没有一个能百分之百令我满意的。
比如「Things」这个主题，我很喜欢它的简洁风格，但是它每一级的标题颜色却似乎并不遵循某种规律，甚至莫名其妙地在二级标题下多出了一条下划线，这一点让完美主义的我无比介意。

我明白，主题风格毕竟只是制作者的个人喜好，肯定是做不到让所有使用者都百分之百满意的。那么，有没有什么办法，可以让我自己来自定义主题呢？
答案是有的，Obsidian 设置中的「CSS 代码片段」这个功能就是为用户对外观进行自定义而准备的。

HTML 与 CSS
Obsidian 的外观本质上是由 CSS 代码所决定的。
我们可以打开 Obsidian 的窗口，按下 Ctrl + Shift + I，即可开启开发者工具（Developer Tools），这个操作和在浏览器中开启开发者工具是一样的，展示出来的也同样是 HTML 文档。

HTML，全称「HyperText Markup Language」，又称为「超文本标记语言」，它的作用就是告诉浏览器这个网页该怎么渲染，比如这段文字是一级标题，这一段文字是正文，而这一段文字是链接，可以跳转别的网页。
听起来和 Obsidian 所使用的 Markdown 很像。没错，M…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[写在开头
相信许多普通用户都在用着M-ATX规格的主板，这也是颇具性价比的装机方案之一，毕竟追求极致性能也是需要口袋中有充足的氪金。但很有意思的是，虽然我们用着M-ATX规格主板，但机箱却多为ATX塔式。就如同我一样，给自己整了一个大机箱，装着一块M-ATX主板，美其名曰多出的空间散热更好。但说实话，机箱的散热效率还是要看风道设计，并不是箱子越大越好。

目前市面上M-ATX规格机箱并没有太多的新意，不是全侧透就是双侧透，有些外观甚至只差一个厂家LOGO，可选的机箱造型并不多，说是属于“缩小版”的ATX塔式机箱也不为过。对于我这种想减少光渲染又不想完全损失光影的玩家来说，确实很难抉择。

不过幸好最近华硕新推出了一款M-ATX规格机箱--华硕ASUS PRIME AP201冰立方机箱。初看商品介绍页面并没太大感觉，但翻了几篇买家秀后，发现设计感贼给力。接下来就聊聊我的换机体验，希望给各位小伙伴带来一些参考。

来自PRIME大师系列

当我将机箱换成华硕ASUS PRIME AP201冰立方机箱（以下简称华硕AP201冰立方机箱）并开机后，原先十分耀眼的光污染瞬间变得柔和起来。

关掉室内灯光后，整个华硕AP201冰立方机箱的光效就如同穿上了一套薄纱，内部的硬件会随着RGB灯效若隐若现，附加了一种神秘，确实有一种立方体的既视感。

从正上方看去，水冷风扇光影透过散热孔散出，被分割成具有像素风的格纹，经过切割的光影既复古又有奇幻的感觉。

而在光线充足的环境中，光影又并不会透出多少，朦胧中充满了低调，颇具内涵。

实际上华硕AP201冰立方机箱的内部自成天地，光影被拉得很足，离光污染全开之间也只差一个机盖开启动作。

外观小巧，却“大”有来头

华硕AP201冰立方机箱的外包装比较低调简洁，产品的特色描述并不算多，注明了支持360mm水冷，338mm显卡和ATX电源。

Notion、Obsidian、Logseq、Roam Research、Evernote、flomo、为知、飞书、语雀……知识管理/笔记软件越来越多，我总在不同应用间徘徊。直到有次忽然醒悟，知识管理软件不是管理知识，而是管理笔记。笔记里的知识并不属于你，只有经过消化、应用，才会成为自己的知识。
这么简单的事，我之前却一直没看透，总是把笔记与知识理解划上了等号。当要用到曾摘录的笔记时，就在各类知识管理软件里翻找，折腾一番才找到需要的笔记，有时甚至出现「自己不清楚放在哪里，也不清楚是否有」的情况。记笔记花了一个小时，下次寻找与重新消化又花了一个小时，原本为效率而生的知识管理软件变成了浪费时间的杀手。
另一方面，我们在用知识管理软件的美观界面和强大功能的同时，也被这些软件所限制，无法完全按自己的想法输出笔记。比如，你长了一双翅膀，Markdown 文本是自由的天地，而进入 Notion 则被隔成一个个小房间，你在房间里待着很舒服，可一旦想去其他房间，就必须脱离 block，不比 Markdown 可以自由飞翔。

突破迷思后，我基于 VuePress 和 vuepress-theme-hope 建立了 LearnData 项目，把知识笔记、生活记录、博客和任何觉得有价值的记录转成 Markdown 文本，然后推送到 GitHub 生成 Pages 静态页面，同步到国内云服务器形成 LearnData - 开源学习笔记。

LearnData 的笔记/文章编辑均使用 Markdown，输出不再受到应用的局限。同时，LearnData …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
2022年是新能源车国补的收尾年，随着销量提升，纯电新能源车品牌不断增多，可选性逐渐增大，价格也不断攀升。 

新能源车最完美的使用环境就是有家用充电桩的日常通勤，享受每公里0.05元以下的电费成本，每天到家就能补足电量，即不产生里程焦虑，也极大程度降低出行成本。
早年新能源车标配充电桩，如今随着价格的提高，充电桩成为了重点阉割项目，不说早早就卖8000的特斯拉，今年的小鹏、问界、沃尔沃都不再赠送充电桩，未来越来越多的厂商会加入这一行列。
7KW充电桩或成为未来主流
虽然我个人认为家用申请380V电表，安装21KW充电桩是拓展性最好的极优解，但目前随着环境的改变，未来大部分国人的家充桩都会是220V 7KW的家用桩。 

首先是电网的审批层面，上海地区的国家电网已经于今年停止了380V充电桩电表的新装报批，目前国网只为新能源车主开放220V电表，最大功率7KW的申请渠道。
这是因新能源车增多而出现的必然趋势，国内未来势必会逐渐取消380V电表用于充电。 

第二是对于交流充电而言，家用充电桩是带有保护装置的连接件，充电过程发生于车载充电机，最快交流充电速度由充电机决定，目前国内在售交流充电速率最高的是16KW，搭载在Model S与Model X两台百万级豪车上，一般大众款新能源车，没有这样的高功率电机。 

理想、威马、蔚来、比亚迪、埃安、荣威等主流的新能源车品牌的核心车型，基本都是内置7KW充电机，不支持11KW三相电来交流充电，所以对于很多车主，7KW充电桩已经是顶配了。
最后是7KW交流充电的表现，以谷时点8小时计算，可以为车辆补充56度电，目前市面大部分家用中小型纯电新能源车的能耗在每度电6~7公里，折算一夜谷时可以补电300~350公里，完全可以狠狠开上一整天。
所以，因为政策、热销车辆和7KW充电桩家充综合体验来看，220V 7KW的家充桩或将是未来家庭…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-08-22T03:11:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[「第二份简历」
首先解释一下这个「第二份」是什么意思。我通常喜欢把在大四校招时使用的简历称作「第一份简历」，因为那是你踏入社会的第一步，是你第一次将自己的经历通过简历来展示。往后跳槽、换工作使用的简历都可以称作「第二份」，它代表着你已经是一个成熟的社会人，有足够的社会、工作经验。
那么就让我们先回看一下「第一份简历」我们都会写一些什么。我们在写校招简历的时候，通常会涉及到的内容为以下几点。

专业课分数 / 绩点
奖惩情况
兼职情况
在校期间参与的项目（可以是学校的实验，也可以是兼职参与的项目）
在校期间所任职务

这五点足够展现你在大学四年的能力，让校招企业充分了解你。因为能够参与校招的企业，都知道你不会有正式的工作经历，自然也没参与过社会上的工作项目。企业人事对参与校招的学生大多抱着「该生是否有培养空间」的态度来面对。因此在写校招简历的时候上面五点只需要充分体现你的潜力就足以吸引到大部分校招企业。
来到「第二份简历」，这个时候你面对的 HR ，不再会把你当作初出茅庐的应届毕业生，而是一个有着社会工作经验的求职者。HR 对求职者的要求也非常简单明了，即「你是否能为公司创造价值」。这个「价值」可以是短期内的，也可以是长远角度的，具体看 HR 怎么定位你的职位。但是有一点是不变的，那就是上面提到的，你不再是学生，你只是「求职者」。
如何写「第二份简历」
「第二份简历」相比「第一份简历」，会有不少内容上的变化。首先是不再着重于在校情况的描写，而是着墨于当前或者上段工作经历的一个梳理与细致归纳。不要简单概括，而是要将内容详细写出来。同时，在现公司或者前公司所做的项目，也要有个清晰的描写。
工作经历

让我们先来看看这份简历。这是少数派员工 @三点一四 的个人简历，也是现在许多求职者非常典型的一种简历。在工作经历中「工作职责」这一栏有两个条目，一个是「监督员工工作状…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近我们发布了一款全新的笔记产品——Neatfiy。（https://neatifyapp.com/）
正如其名，Neat（整洁）ify（化），Neatify 的初衷是编辑整洁清晰的结构化笔记，比起很快速的随手记备忘录，它适用于知识的管理、周期性的写作总结...之类的场景。
如左图
在大约去年年底的时候，我们立下了一个 Flag——我们要将专注笔记进行一次重构。 Neatify 就是我们拿出来的结果。下面不简单地聊一下，我们在这个路上的一些思考，以及集中回答一些朋友提出的疑问：

很多人对于 Neatify 的第一个疑问，就是为什么我们团队要出两款很相似的两款产品？

专注笔记，是我们第一款推出的笔记软件。也是我们团队首次接触「笔记」软件的开始，虽然我们自己也很喜欢专注笔记，它有很多很有用的功能及体验，比如结构化的目录、清晰的标注阅读体验。
但确实我们是第一次做笔记软件，前期很多没想清楚的地方，因此做了很多没什么用、甚至很负面的一些设计。这些是一些很沉重的历史包袱。如果我们还背着沉重的历史包袱，我们在优化的过程中就显得被束缚住了。
很显然的是，我们在这三年多的积累里，最重要的不是我们写过了什么代码，而是积累了很多很多的经验。所以我们这次，希望是抛开一切已有的东西，去构思一款自己心目中最理想的笔记产品应该是怎样的。这就是 Neatify。
在 Neatfiy 上面，我们并没有很刻意地去增加很多的功能，来让它看上去有很明显被“改版升级”的感觉，甚至做了很多的减法，比如：
1、把笔记本、子页面等层级都砍了，只保留文件夹 → 页面这样的结构，因为在使用专注笔记的时候，我们总在纠结，这样的层级关系，我们应该使用笔记本呢？还是子页面呢？还是文件夹呢？它们之间的作用太相似了，在每次使用的时候都要思考很久，这是意见很“反效率”的事情。
2、把很多花里胡哨的功能去了，比如各种各样的视图啊之类…]]></summary>

软件的选择与流程的建立
在漫长的学习之路上，我遇到了学习软件，它们和我磨合、指导我的学习、被我不断的筛选。在这个过程中我逐渐有了一些想法来选择软件，并最终建立流程。
软件的主要特性-一切的基础
我也许从来都是一个缺少方法的人，直到软件进入我的生活，与其说它们是工具，不如说它们是我的一部分关于学习的性格。 我从不对软件硬性要求，要求它符合我的工作流程或是符合我的方法论，我对它们抱有了更大的期望，我对那些能做我以前做不到的事的软件抱有期望，因为它们的价值是难以衡量的。 于是我要求它有某种特性，可以与我使用的软件区别出来，完成我曾经难以完成的工作。
方法论-以实际的场景体现
软件的诞生一开始就会被打上开发者的烙印，就像是同样的教科书，不同的主编会有不同的侧重一样。如果一个软件有着鲜明的主要功能特色那它几乎一定体现着某种思想，但是方法论存在着问题，就是难以证伪，越是想用思想捏合成一座大厦最后会发现地基可能都是不牢的。那么如何使用方法论呢？
1. 与科学接轨，学习有关知识；对信息源可信度进行筛选
2. 在使用中验证方法论，最好有一定程度的量化
3. 简化抽象方法论，细化具体方法论不至于在臃肿中走向模糊
4. 重视全面和逻辑性 
扯远了，在软件的方法论验证中，重要的无疑是第二条。 如何验证呢，就是在它主张的场景使用它（或仅仅是想象使用），注意它的价值，这是我认为最好的方式，一个好的软件应该是向你描绘了一个出色高效的使用过程。 另一种方法是看受人欢迎的软件，某种意义上来说它的有效经过了人的验证，注意它的独特性即可。
软件的使用与功能的解构
当我们使用一款软件，很多情况下并不是按照作者给出的使用场景进行使用，但这不意味着这种使用是错误的，因为开发者不可能列出所有的使用场景，也与你的面对的场景不尽相同。了解软件的边界重点在于对其功能的理解。
1、具体的使用场景下蕴…]]></summary>
