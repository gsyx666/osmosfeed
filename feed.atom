European Union lawmakers have reached a political agreement on legislation that will effectively ban the production of new combustion engine cars and vans from 2035. 
As one of the world’s largest trading blocs and home to some of the world’s biggest car manufacturers, the EU’s decision will have a huge impact on global transport, pushing the industry even more firmly towards a fully electric future. The legislation will now have to be formally approved by the EU Council and the Parliament, though it’s expected only minor changes will be made. 
The key requirements are that, by 2030, new cars reduce their C02 emissions by 55 percent and new vans by 50 percent (in both cases these emissions are compared to 2021 levels). Then, by 2035,...

Xiaomi subsidiary Redmi has just announced its new Note 12 lineup headed by the Note 12 Discovery Edition, a midrange smartphone that supports its 210W HyperCharge fast charging standard. That’s enough wattage to fully charge the phone’s 4,300mAh battery in just nine minutes. Put the handset on to charge and hop into the shower, and the phone’s battery will likely be completely replenished before you’ve had a chance to towel yourself off.
In recent years, there’s been fierce competition to offer faster and faster charging speeds for mobile phones. Xiaomi offered 120W fast charging on its 11T Pro handset last year, before competitor Oppo announced its own 150W SuperVOOC standard. Arguably we’ve quickly reached a point of diminishing...

Low-code is not flexible enough

You'll get stuck and you'll have to restart the project using "full code"

Let me therefor define low-code by using the simplest possible analogy I can.
Low-code is just like "ng generate" or "ng new" from Angular - Except where ng stops, low-code frameworks keeps on adding thousands of additional lines of code to your solution
At least our low-code solution generates code. There is nothing mysterious about it. If you've used Entity Framework from Microsoft, you've arguably used low-code for years. When you …]]></summary>

Many engineers and craftspeople are particular about their tools. To do a job well, you need the best tools and the skills to use them. The best tools in software development can be very powerful when applied to other kinds of digital creation. The Docs as Code approach is a great example. Docs as Code entails writing documentation using the same tools and workflows used for developing code. Proponents of Docs as Code report that this method leads to better documentation while easing the workload of the people who write it.

YouTube is updating its website and app so Shorts, live streams, and regular videos each have their own tab on a creator’s channel, instead of being thrown together in a single list (via 9to5Google). In a support post, the company says the change is based on user feedback, and that it’ll “make it easier for viewers to discover the kinds of content they’re most interested in when exploring a creator’s channel page.”
Before the update, if you went to a channel you’d see a single tab labeled “videos,” which showed you a list of all the user’s uploads, including shorts, live streams, and regular-length videos. While there is a filter that lets you change which format the list shows, it gets reset every time you leave the page, so when you...

It’s been six long years since Rihanna blessed the world with new solo music for Star Trek Beyond, of all things, but the wait’s finally over with “Lift Me Up,” an original song from Black Panther: Wakanda Forever’s forthcoming soundtrack.
Co-written by Rihanna, Tems, Ryan Coogler, and producer Ludwig Göransson, “Lift Me Up” is both a moving ballad and a tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman, star of the first Black Panther film who passed away in 2020 at the age of 43 following a battle with colon cancer. In a press release about the song, Tems said that she wanted it to feel like a “warm embrace” to all the loved ones she’s lost personally — a theme present throughout Wakanda Forever.

Over the summer for our project management and implementation course (PRJ 566 and PRJ 666), we were tasked to create a project entirely of our liking. We had the freedom to choose, plan, and manage a project all by ourselves with weekly mentorship and guidance from our professor. The only requirement was - we had to do something creative and complex. But complex looks very different from one person to another. We had to justify why what we chose to do was complex enough to pass the course. It was unclear to us what we were going to do. We brainstormed and brainstormed as a team. The fields of AI seemed pretty appealing, and we were thinking of something to do with optical character recognition (OCR) because I was dealing with an OCR-related project as a research assist…]]></summary>

周四，经过几个月的法律纠纷后，埃隆·马斯克捧着一个水槽进入了推特总部大楼。除了原 CEO、CFO 之外，总法律顾问、首席客户官等高管也被辞退，有消息称，有的高管是被保安带出去的。不过，这些高管都是拿着巨额补偿走的。马斯克曾谈到利用推特创建一个类似微信的超级应用 “X 应用”。

谷歌推出以太坊节点云服务

谷歌云区块链节点引擎将是一个“完全管理的节点托管服务，可以最大限度地减少对节点操作的需求”，这意味着谷歌云将负责监控节点活动，并在停机后重新启动它们。谷歌的宣布标志着技术巨头对区块链和 Web3 项目给予了越来越多的关注。

苹果公司在开发者的强烈抗议下暂停了应用商店的赌博广告

周二，苹果公司宣布在其应用商店中投放更多的广告，这包括在应用程序的页面上宣传其它应用程序。开发者发现在他们的应用程序下有很多不当的广告，比如一个老虎机应用被放在赌博成瘾康复应用旁边做广告，还有一些例子是其他博彩应用被放在针对儿童的应用页面上做广告，成人视频聊天应用出现在苹果图书页面，约会应用被放在旨在改善现有关系的应用下面。在受到大量批评之后，苹果已经“暂停了应用商店产品页面上与赌博和其他一些类别有关的广告”。

We believe that while potential is evenly distributed across society, opportunities are not. Two years ago, we were born with the mission to accelerate LatAm’s transition towards social equality by connecting people with high-paying jobs worldwide.

We source and train the best software developers and data scientists from LatAm and we place them in jobs remotely that pay them 3x-5x more than they can get locally, and it's still 3x cheaper than hiring in the US. And you won't notice a difference because they're all fluent in English, in your timezone, incredibly hard workers, and the top 3% of all applicants we get, so we've already filtered for quality for you. 

Our training process has a hands-on top-tier curriculum validated with leaders and experts in the tech industry and +800 coding hours in simulated work environments. +1,500 companies around the world hire our talent including YC companies, Google, PayPal, Auth0, JPMorgan, Microsoft, among others. 

How it works?👇

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是你在 Linux 终端中安装和玩经典贪吃蛇的方法。


还记得老式手机经典简单的贪吃蛇吗？我记得玩了几个小时。嘿，当时没有其他选择，对吧？智能手机仍未上市。而你所拥有的只有这个。



但随着时间的推移，贪吃蛇被具有各种选项的更高级的图形游戏所取代。但没有什么能比得上经典贪吃蛇游戏。

如果我告诉你，你可以在 Linux 终端中玩这个游戏呢？无论你运行的是 Ubuntu Linux、Fedora Linux 还是 Arch Linux，都无关紧要。该游戏适用于大多数 发行版。



安装 nSnake – Linux 终端的贪吃蛇

你可以使用以下方法通过终端安装 此游戏。

对于 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 或其他相关发行版：

sudo apt install nsnake


对于 Fedora Linux 和其他：

sudo dnf install nsnake


对于 Arch Linux，此游戏可在 Arch 用户仓库（AUR） 中获得。你可以使用以下步骤安装它。


设置 Yay AUR 助手

然后打开终端并运行以下命令


yay -S nsnake


上面的命令会安装游戏的软件仓库版本，它可能不是最新的。但是，如果你想要最新版本，你可能需要通过 GitHub 编译源代码。我在本页末尾添加了编译说明供你参考。

玩游戏

玩游戏非常简单。在终端中输入 nsnake，这将启动游戏。

要立即退出，请按 q。

以下是默认键绑定。


箭头键 - 移动蛇

q – 退出游戏

p – 暂停游戏


你还可以通过主菜单以各种方式配置游戏。



完成了，玩吧！

编译

要编译最新版本，请在所有 Linux 发行版中使用以下命令。

哦，确保你已经安装了 git 和 ncurses-devel，它们是编译所需的包。

git clone https://github.com/alexdantas/nSnake.gitcd nsnakemakemake install


那么，你喜欢贪吃蛇游戏吗？与其他基于终端的游戏相比，你更喜欢它吗？在下面的评论框中与其他读者分享你的观点。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是我们安装 Ubuntu 22.10 “Kinetic Kudu”（GNOME 版）后，推荐做的 10 件事列表。




Ubuntu 22.10 带来了很多令人兴奋的新功能，例如 GNOME 43、最新的内核、重新设计的托盘菜单、文件应用的功能和 Pipewire 等 新功能。

我相信你已经迫不及待地想尝试 Ubuntu 22.10 上的这些新功能了。

但是请先等一等。

在你前往享受你新安装的 Ubuntu 22.10 之前，我要向你推荐一个不容错过的 Ubuntu 定制技巧列表。

安装 Ubuntu 22.10 后要做的 10 件事

1、更新你的系统

安装好 Ubuntu 22.10 后，第一件要做的事就是更新你的系统。因为时差的原因，最新的 ISO 镜像通常不会包括所有的系统更新。所以，你要打开一个终端窗口，并运行以下命令，来更新你的系统。

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade


上述命令执行完成后，你就可以进行下一步啦。

2、删除 Firefox Snap，并安装 Flatpak 或者 deb 版本的 Firefox

自去年发布的 Ubuntu 21.10 版本以来，默认的网页浏览器 Firefox 开始以 Snap 软件包的形式出现。如果你是普通用户，这可能不是一个问题或者需要担心的事情。但是出于几个原因，例如 Snap 软件包的 Firefox 启动时间较长、且当 Firefox 有后台更新时，会有不必要的 Snap 更新通知等等原因，导致许多用户不太喜欢 Firefox 的 Snap 软件包。

因此，你可以按照 我写的另一篇操作指南，来完全删除 Firefox 的 Snap 软件包。这一过程有点复杂，需要花费一点时间。删除完成后，再从个人软件包存档（PPA）安装 deb…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[满打满算，我加入键盘圈子已经超过三年了。我感觉自己非常有幸，能亲身经历键盘圈子三年之间的种种改变。结合自己的每一个过往经历，给大家总结下键盘的过去现在和未来。

2019年，热插拔结构萌芽

在2019年，客制化键盘圈子当中，热插拔结构逐渐普及开来。那个时候我是一个很普通的键盘小白。只想要一个高端机械键盘，来满足我一个手游程序员的日常工作需求。而客制化键盘需要买家亲自去组装键盘的所有零部件。而安装轴体对于小白来说，就是一个非常巨大的门槛。在当时安装轴体的方法有两种，一种就是传统的焊接，需要用户学习焊接的基础知识，需要购买焊台，焊锡。学习焊接轴体的操作技巧，操作不当，还有可能把键盘电路板烧毁，损毁轴体。因为客制化键盘都是采用团购的形式，制作工期极长，所有的零件都是根据购买量定制的，电路板有个三长两短，再找一块电路板来，就不是那么容易的事情了，焊接完成之后，想要更换轴体，更是一件麻烦事，需要重新拆解键盘，学习使用吸锡器。键盘带有热插拔结构之后，只需要在安装之前，掌握轴体的安装方向，轻轻一按，轴体就安装完成了。可以说是小白新手的福音，能极大的降低客制化键盘圈子的入圈门槛。
而在当时，愿意增加热插拔结构的客制化键盘，却非常的少。造成这一现象的原因，我分成两种：
一是客观原因，在当时客制化键盘的生产线，没有现如今那么强大。零件需要外包出去制作。负责生产的工厂水平参差不齐，最终生产的成品，出现划痕，刀痕，色差的情况，也是时有发生。最严重的情况就是外包的工厂心术不正，直接卷钱跑路。键盘的电路板制作也是如此。为了满足客制化键盘圈子内用户的需求，团长一般会出不同的佩列来吸引用户，比如无win键佩列，hhkb佩列，7字型回车，长空格佩列，阶梯caps lock 佩列等。加一个热插拔就意味着双倍的电路板定制需求，所以往往支持热插拔的客制化键盘，选配项都是被阉割的。甚至有可能延后补发电路板。
二是…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[systemd 创始人认为 Linux 的启动并不安全

已经加入了微软的 systemd 创始人 Lennart Poettering 认为，在启用了安全启动的硬件上，虽然启动过程（包括内核）是签名的，但下一步，即加载 initrd，却没有签名。他提议将 Linux 启动过程转移到加密签名的统一内核镜像，使用 TPM 2.0 硬件加强 Linux 系统启动过程的安全性。initrd 是“初始化内存磁盘”，恶意软件或入侵者可以在 initrd 中插入恶意代码，而且每次系统启动时都会加载该代码，即使该恶意代码的其他副本不存在于硬盘上。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：想法是很好，但是这就是一个不透明的盒子。




Linux 内核开始为 800 Gbps 网络做准备

IEEE 已经发布了 800Gbps 网络的标准，而英伟达正在开发 800Gbps 网络硬件，其 Linux 内核驱动的开发人员确认，下一代英伟达 Spectrum ASIC 将支持 800Gbps 的速度。虽然 800Gbps 已经是目前最高端的 400Gbps 带宽的两倍，但以太网联盟今年的路线图已经将 1.6Tbps 网络作为未来几年内的计划。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：Linux 内核在抛弃博物馆硬件的同时，越来越多的成为新硬件的第一批支持系统。




Fedora 40 正在为迁移到更现代的 C 语言标准做准备

1999 年发布的 C 语言标准（C99）删除了一些向后兼容的特性，然而，GCC 仍然默认接受这些过时的构造。但对这些结构体的支持让程序员感到困惑，并有可能影响 GCC 实现未来 C 标准中的功能。计划 2024 年发布的 GCC 14 编译器，正在考虑默认禁用对传统 C 语言结构的支持。LLVM 的开发者也正在考虑可能比这更早地禁用传统的 C 语言结构。Fedora 40 计划更主动地发现那些仍然依赖传统 C 语言行为的开源项目，以在 GCC 14 前就消除对旧的 C 语言标准的支持。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：说是新的 C 语言标准，其实也有 20 多年了——都说程序员是喜新厌旧的，但是似乎都抱着自己用惯的语言不肯放手。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pseudonymous Account Generation: you only need a wallet address to sign up and use (if you don’t have any, you can instantly create one within the app; Ready is friendly to non-crypto owners that way. Your new wallet is Ethereum-based and compatible with other Ethereum projects). No phone number, email address, or DOB whatsoever is required upon account generation and in subsequent steps.
- Encrypted Messenger: your conversations in 1-1 chats, private groups, and private channels are end-to-end encrypted by default, and we give you a randomly generated pseudonym.
- Multi-Chain Crypto Wallet: if you are a crypto owner, this is what you would love. Besides multi-chain crypto management, we also offer other features such as transacting via 1-1 chats and smart swaps (i.e. DEX aggregator).

Again, we’d like to highlight that Ready is not just for crypto owners or blockchain enthusiasts. Though its technological foundation is blockchain-related (in particular, non-custodial wallets), Ready can be used easily by anyone.

We’re so excited to announce that we’ve just launched our Beta (iOS, Android) and are also running a Beta Program for public testing. You can check out our Beta version and Beta Program here. 

We’d really love to see your feedback, ideas, or even bug reports. Please leave those in the in-app Ready Feedback chat or just share them as comments under this post. Every thought is much appreciated as it takes us a step closer to developing a product best suited for you and other users.

For more information about Ready, please visit https://ready.io/.

Thanks, and we can’t wait to hear what you think about Ready!

@王百顺BS：Nutale Air Pro - Airtag下位替代品

入手渠道：淘宝
入手价格：192 元

新发布的 AirPods Pro 内置了 Airtag 又让我重新对这个去年发布的小东西提起了兴趣，恰好看到 Nutale Air Pro 打折，四个套装比单个 Airtag 还便宜，就想试试能不能作为平替。
先放两张外观的图片：
正面：金属边框，两面塑料，有一颗按键，一个发声的开槽（按键手感很差软塌塌的没有反馈）背面：有个放纽扣电池的盖子，用手一推就能打开，一颗 CR2032 纽扣电池
几天试用下来体验还不错，有「Works with Apple Find My」的认证所以可以直接在「查找」app 中的「物品」这一栏添加设备，所有的操作也都是在「查找」app 中，和查看其他 Apple 的设备操作一样。
在查找 app 中的界面，这个两个物品都是
价格便宜自然会有一些缺失的功能，比如：精确查找。 就是到达 Airtag 附近（大概 20 米以内吧）之后触发精确查找，告诉你在什么方向还有多远。 这个功能在 Nutale Air Pro 上是没有的（据说是因为 Apple 还没有开放 UWB 所以市面上还没有第三方的产品具备精确查找），你只能到达附近之后通过播放声音来寻找，声音大小用 Apple Watch 粗略测试了一下可以达到 95 分贝，装到帆布包里间隔两米声音大概 60 分贝，装在包里隔一堵墙距离大概 7 米就需要仔细听了。
精确查找：图片来自 Apple 官网截图

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[way too much a few years ago, so I built this news website that publishes the news only once per day without any images, videos, ads, or all the other insanity that's displayed on news websites these days. It grabs the latest newsworthy headlines off of Wikipedia and displays it in a minimal UI that's free of distractions and insanely fast, which I define as 250ms or less.

In an effort to read the news even less I built a weekly digest that aggregates the daily headlines and emails it out Friday afternoon. This allows me to "stay informed" without falling into the trap of constantly checking the news.

Finally, I found myself getting really annoyed at how slow news websites were, mainly because of all the ads they pump into their pages, so I created a speed comparison at https://legiblenews.com/speed that plugs into the Google Page Speed tools to test all major news websites. To no surprise Legible News is the fastest 🏎️💨

Check it out and if you love it, consider supporting this project by subscribing for a Plus subscription at https://legiblenews.com/plus (the daily news will always be free!)

Seth Kenlon

Lua isn't an object-oriented programming language, but a scripting language utilizing C functions and a C-like syntax. However, there's a cool hack you can use within Lua code to make Lua act like an object-oriented language when you need it to be. The key is in the Lua table construct, and this article demonstrates how to use a Lua table as a stand-in for an object-oriented class.
What is object-oriented programming?
The term "object-oriented" is a fancy way of describing, essentially, a templating system. Imagine you're programming an application to help users spot and log zombies during a zombie apocalypse. You're using an object-oriented language like C++, Java, or Python. You need to …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
2022年10月24日，特斯拉官宣降价，基础版本model 3降价1.4万，model y降价2.8万，可以说是非常大的降价幅度，结合2022款整体上更新的车机芯片加上扩大的电池容量，一部分车款可以说是重回性价比车型的行列。
我们讲电车使用成本低，是基于有家用充电桩的环境，如果都用特斯拉超充，不算停车费，每公里电费都能到3毛以上，而使用谷时电家充，每公里电费可以控制在5分钱。但家充桩需要有固定车位，还要向电网申请电表，以及需要物业允许施工的证明，这些硬性条件也劝退着一些潜在车主。
而除了固定的家用充电桩，还有便携充电器，也就是随车充可以作为新能源车的补能方案。随车充在使用上可以使用家庭插座，支持自带线缆从家中接到室外充电，不需要独立电表，对于公司有插座、农村有自建房以及低楼层居民楼住户都比较友好。
本篇选择了四款随车充，覆盖了品牌、设计特点、功率支持的几个不同方向，来详细对比产品设计和具体功能，希望能为随车充的选择答疑解惑。
缆上控制与保护装置（IC-CDP)

其实随车充产品我分析过很多次，它本质上就是从电源到新能源车电机的连接装置，换言之就是一根电源线，电能转化为电池电量都是在新能源车内部完成的。而对于随车充产品消费首先需要重点关注的就是是否配备了缆上控制与保护装置，缩写为IC-CDP。
在国家标准GB/T 18487.1-2015《电动汽车传导充电系统 第一部分:通用要求》中，将就是一根电缆连接电动汽车和交流电网的随车充称为模式1产品；将电缆上加入IC-CDP的随车充产品称为模式2产品。前者可以为车充电，根据电缆长度不同售价在200元上下，但模式1产品缺乏保护功能和控制功能，便宜但抗风险能力基本为0。后者模式2则是大部分车主的核心选择，通过控制盒可以实现各种差异化功能，特斯拉、比亚迪的原厂随车充我们称为车规产品，都是模式2随车充。
对于我们私家车主而言，充电安全…]]></summary>

VirtualBox 能让任何人都可以轻松安装 Linux 虚拟机。你不需要有使用命令行的经验，就可以自己安装一个简单的 Linux 虚拟机。在虚拟机方面，我精通很多东西，但这篇文章将向新手展示如何安装一个 Linux 虚拟机。此外，这篇文章还概述了如何使用开源虚拟机管理程序 VirtualBox ，来运行以及安装一个测试目的的 Linux 系统。

一些术语

在开始之前，你需要了解在本安装教程中的两个操作系统（OS）之间的区别：


主机系统host system：这指的是你安装 VirtualBox 的操作系统（即本机的操作系统）。

客体系统guest system：这指的是你想要在主机系统之上运行的虚拟化系统。


在输入/输出、网络、文件访问、剪贴板、音频和视频方面，主机系统和客体系统都必须能够交互。

在本教程中，我将使用 Windows 10 作为 主机系统，Fedora 33 作为 客体系统。

安装前的准备

当我们谈论虚拟化时，实际上，我们指的是 硬件辅助虚拟化。硬件辅助虚拟化需要兼容的 CPU。过去十年来，几乎每个普通的 x86 CPU 都有这一功能。AMD 公司称这样的 x86 CPU 是具有 AMD 虚拟化技术（AMD-V） 的处理器，英特尔公司则称其是具有 Intel 虚拟化技术（VT-x） 的处理器。虚拟化功能增加了一些额外的 CPU 指令，你可以在 BIOS 中启用或禁用这些指令。

在安装虚拟机之前：


确保在 BIOS 中启用了虚拟化技术（AMD-V 或 VT-x）。

下载并安装好 VirtualBox。


准备虚拟机

很久以来，我就对习惯很感兴趣。几年前，我做了一次关于习惯利弊的演讲，并且介绍了如何改变坏习惯、养成好习惯。不久前，我阅读了 Art Markman 教授的 《Smart Thinking》一书，这本书主要讨论的也是习惯。或许你会问习惯与 开放式组织的原则 有什么关系？这其中有一定的联系！我将会分成两篇文章，来解释你可以如何管理你的习惯。

在本文中，我们将讨论习惯如何工作的，以及更重要的是你如何去开始改变你的习惯。在下一篇文章中，我们将回顾 Markman 教授在他书中所表达的思想。

开放式组织原则和习惯的交集

设想你学习过开放式组织的原则，尽管你认为它们很有趣并且很有价值，但是你还没有对这些原则形成自己的习惯。以下就是你现实中会表现出来的样子。

社区：如果你面对一项重要挑战，但是你不知道如何独自解决它，你很有可能会由于习惯而放弃这项挑战。养成与由志同道合的人组成的社区，共同解决问题的习惯，不是更好吗？

协作：假设你认为你不善于合作，你喜欢独立完成任务。你知道有一些需要合作才能完成的事情，但是你并没有参与合作的习惯。为了弥补这种情况，你必须养成与他人更多合作的习惯。

信息共享：假如说你喜欢将你所做的事以及所知道的东西当作秘密。但是，你知道如果你不共享信息，你也无法从他人那里获取有用的信息。因此，你必须拥有共享信息的习惯。

包容性：想象一下，你与你不熟悉的人，或者是在个性、文化还是语言上都与你不同的人一起工作，你会感到不自在。但是，你知道如果你想要成功的话，你必须要和各种各样的人一同工作。那你该如何培养包容的习惯呢？

适应能力：假设当你所做的事情不再能达到你所希望的结果之后，你往往会拒绝改变。但是，你知道你必须适应这种情况，并重新调整你的努力，那你如何才…]]></summary>

        <id>https://linux.cn/article-15181-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</id>
        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15181-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-10-27T01:13:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这篇文章中，我们将介绍如何在 Ubuntu 服务器 22.04 上设置静态 IP 地址。


强烈建议在 Linux 服务器上使用静态 IP，因为它会在重启后保持不变。静态 IP 对邮件服务器、Web 服务器和文件服务器等服务器起着重要作用。

准备条件


最小安装的 Ubuntu 服务器 22.04

具有 sudo 管理员权限的普通用户


在 Ubuntu 服务器 22.04 中，网络由 netplan 程序控制，因此我们将使用 netplan 在 Ubuntu 服务器上配置静态 IP 地址。

注意：我们不能使用 nmcli 程序，因为它不是 Ubuntu 服务器上默认安装的一部分。

在 Ubuntu 服务器 22.04 上设置静态 IP 地址

登录到你的 Ubuntu 服务器 22.04，查找 netplan 配置文件。它位于 /etc/netplan 目录下。

$ cd /etc/netplan/
$ ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 116 Oct 12 04:03 00-installer-config.yaml
$


运行以下 cat 命令以查看 00-installer-config.yaml 的内容。

注意：配置文件的名称可能因你的设置而异。由于它是一个 yaml 文件，因此请确保在编辑时保持缩进和语法。

$ cat 00-installer-config.yaml


输出：



根据上面的输出，它说我们有 ens33 接口，它正在从 DHCP 服务器获取 IP。查看接口名称的另一种方法是通过 ip 命令。

现在，要配置静态 IP 代替 DHCP，使用 vi 或 nano 编辑器编辑 netplan 配置文件并添加以下内容。

$ sudo vi 00-installer-config.yaml
# This is the network config written by 'subiquity'
network:
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    ens33:
      addresses:
        - 192.168.1.247/24
      nameservers:
        addresses: [4.2.2.2, 8.8.8.8]
      routes:
        - to: default
          via: 192.168.1.1
  version: 2


保存并关闭文件。



在上面的文件中，我们使用了以下内容，


ens33 为接口名称

用于设置静态 IP 的地址

nameservers 用于指定 DNS 服务器的 IP

用于指定默认网关的路由


注意：根据你的环境更改 IP 详细信息和接口名称。

要是上述修改生效，请使用以下 netplan 命令应用这些更改：

$ sudo netplan apply


运行以下 IP 命令查看接口上的 IP 地址：

$ ip addr show ens33


要查看默认路由，请运行：

$ ip route show


上述命令的输出。



完美，以上命令的输出确认静态 IP 和路由配置成功。

这就是这篇文章的全部内容。请在下面的评论部分发表你的问题和反馈。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Presenting — a macOS app for making your screen recordings captivating and engaging.

As an app maker, I often need to showcase how my apps work using screen recordings.

However, I struggled with how they often came across as flat and boring. In particular:

- They're difficult for the viewer to follow
- The area of focus is sometimes too small to see
- An absence of context and flow
- Overall: looks plain, flat, dry, and hella boring 😴

Presenting elevates your demo so that it engages and captivates your audience:

- Get going in minutes with simple controls
- Designed to be easy to use, no experience required
- Use multiple input types (video / image / text)
- Zoom, rotate and pan animations ✨
- Custom design formatting options
- Export to video (in up to 4K resolution, 60FPS)
- Presentation mode (like a powerpoint)

With Presenting, you can create an engaging presentation — just like the video in this post — which was put together entirely in the Presenting app itself, without any post-processing or editing.

If you're a designer, app maker, marketer, product manager or agency, you could find Presenting helpful to level up your presentations, whether they be portfolios, product videos, tutorials or sales pitches.

Enough said — please watch the video and check out the website, where it's free to download the macOS app to try.

For extended use beyond the trial period, you'll need a license key from our store, which you can buy right now at a huge discount to celebrate this launch! 🎉

If you have any feedback, questions or comments, let me know! I'll be around for the next 48 hours replying to EVERYONE.

Thank you! 🥳

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[@joni_karras, we think the issue lies in missing trust and verification methods. Existing methods for talent evaluation are insufficient for modern online-based work, leading hiring to happen within exclusive inner circles. This fails both builders and hiring organizations – thus a year ago, we teamed up to make your achievements matter again.

We at Kleoverse are developing the portfolio for web3 builders. We have built a protocol – Proof-of-Talent – to verify and record achievements on-chain. You can create skill scores based on your achievements and gather this information into an intuitive, highly actionable portfolio. Dozens of organizations are already looking for new talent based on close to 25,000 created portfolios.

This is what you can expect:

📝 Web3 portfolio, designed and built to serve web3 builders
⛓ Blockchain-verified working history with actionable skill scores
⚡️ NFT-based badges for open-source contributions and other achievements
🤝 +700 listed jobs from leading web3 organizations
📈 Rapidly growing community of 25,000 signed-up users
🛠 Tooling for organizations hiring builders
📯 Lots more!

Proof-of-Talent verifies skills objectively and transparently. Our goal is to enable fair and highly accurate matches between projects and builders based on proven skills, not networks or status signals. Starting from web3, we want to uncover hidden talent across industries everywhere in the world.

The product is free to use for both users and organizations. We hope to see many of you in our community, joining our journey of revolutionizing talent measurement and signaling on the web 💚

Our whole team will be here today answering your questions and chatting with the community. We’d love to hear any feedback!

微软在财报会议上宣布了 GitHub 的一些新数据：GitHub 平台目前年收入 10 亿美元，高于收购时报告的 2 至 3 亿美元。GitHub 现在有 9000 万的活跃用户，高于收购结束时的 2800 万。微软于 2018 年以 75 亿美元收购了 GitHub。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：可以说，微软给 GitHub 带来了更大的发展，当然，GitHub 也成了微软的一座宝库。




不管同意不同意，名人的“深度伪造”开始出现在广告中

上周，埃隆･马斯克似乎在一家房地产投资公司的营销视频中出演。而上个月，机器学习公司 Paperspace 的宣传视频中出现了汤姆･克鲁斯和莱昂纳多･迪卡普里奥等演员。这些名人都没有花时间拍摄这些宣传片，他们甚至从未同意为有关公司代言。这和好莱坞传奇人物 布鲁斯･威利斯 的情况不同，使用“深度伪造”技术创作的宣传片是威利斯授权制作的。


消息来源：华尔街日报



老王点评：这种图像融合技术越来越受欢迎，给营销行业带来了新的法律和道德问题。




图片巨头开始销售 AI 生成的图片

AI 图像生成器会不会扼杀图片销售行业？该行业的巨头的答案是“不会” —— 如果他们能先开始销售 AI 生成的内容，就不会。Shutterstock 宣布与 OpenAI 扩大合作，DALL-E 2 将直接整合到 Shutterstock 中。此外，Shutterstock 将向提供了 AI 创作素材的作者们支付费用。另一方面，Shutterstock 禁止在其网站上销售未使用其 DALL-E 整合的 AI 生成的艺术作品。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：螳臂当车而已，随着 AI 普及化，谁还会去买图片？那时候可能各种 AI 图片及其素材都会进入公共领域。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu Budgie 22.10 是一个有趣的版本，它删除了几个 GNOME 应用程序，以及一些其他改进。




Ubuntu Budgie 是 Ubuntu 的官方版本，因其传统的桌面界面和最小的软件膨胀而广受欢迎。

Ubuntu Budgie 22.10 的发布带来了一些关键的调整和补充。

🆕 Ubuntu Budgie 22.10 有什么新变化



基于 Ubuntu 22.10 “充满活力的捻角羚Kinetic Kudu”，Ubuntu Budgie 22.10 带来了 Budgie 桌面 10.6.4 和许多其他改进。

一些值得注意的亮点包括:


增强型 Budgie 控制中心Control Center

更新了 Budgie 的“欢迎Welcome”应用

替换各种基于 GNOME 的应用程序

对翻译进行了更新


Budgie 桌面和控制中心



Budgie 桌面以及更新到 V10.6.4, 它添加了一个新的全局选项来控制小程序之间的间距，并对工作区和时钟小程序进行了各种改进。



Budgie 控制中心Control Center也得到了一堆调整，例如重新设计的显示颜色配置文件支持，修改了对屏幕分享的支持，如 RDP 和 VNC，用于显示缩放的选项，等等。

升级了欢迎应用



Ubuntu Budgie 22.10 特别升级了 Budgie 的欢迎应用，改善了翻译以及一些其他改进。

默认的应用的变化

Ubuntu Budgie 的开发人员已经开始替换和删除基于 GNOME 的应用程序，转而使用基于 MATE 的应用程序和其他替代品。

他们决定这样做是因为基于 GNOME 的应用程序在 Budgie 中的外观与其他具有圆角边缘的应用程序的外观不一致。

这些不一致是由于 GNOME 根据其样式和主题需求而转到 Libadwaita 库造成的。

Libadwaita 库是 GNOME 的一个有争议的补充，没有多少用户喜欢，你可以通过我们的报道来了解更多信息。


你对在 Linux 世界中 GNOME 的 Libadwaita 库怎么看？


以下是一些已删除或替换的应用程序：


GNOME 计算器被 MATE 计算器取代。

删除了 GNOME 日历。

GNOME 系统监视器已由 MATE 系统监视器取代。

删除了 GNOME 截图。

字体管理器 替代了 GNOME 字体查看器。


🛠️ 其他改变

其他改变包括以下：


重新开发的内置主题

移除 PulseAudio，并支持 PipeWire

原生的截图功能

支持 WebP 图像

能够查看显示器的刷新率


你可以通过 发行说明 了解更多。

📥 下载 Ubuntu Budgie 22.10

你可以在 Ubuntu 中央镜像仓库 或者它的 官方网站 下载最新的 ISO。

其官方网站可能需要一段时间才能提供 ISO。


下载 Ubuntu Budgie 22.10



💡 Ubuntu Budgie 22.10 将支持 9 个月直到 2023 年 6 月。如果你想使用稳定的功能，更应该选择 LTS 版本。


💬 你如何看待这个非 LTS 版本？愿意尝试一下吗？

由于运行上千个应用程序容器荚Pod所耗费的资源多，令它实现较少工作节点和资源占用所需成本也较高，所以在使用 Kubernetes 时，快速启动和较少的内存占用是至关重要的。在 Kubernetes 平台运行容器化微服务时，内存占用是比吞吐量更重要的考量因素，这是因为：


由于需要持续运行，所以耗费资源更多（不同于 CPU 占用）

微服务令开销成本成倍增加

一个单体应用程序变为若干个微服务的情况（例如 20 个微服务占用的存储空间约有 20GB）


这些情况极大影响了无服务器函数的发展和 Java 部署模型。到目前为止，许多企业开发人员选择 Go、Python 或 Node.js 这些替代方案来解决性能瓶颈，直到出现了 Quarkus 这种基于 kubernetes 的原生 Java 堆栈，才有所改观。本文介绍如何在使用了 Quarkus 的 kubernetes 平台上进行性能优化，以便运行无服务器函数。

容器优先的设计理念

由于 Java 生态系统中传统的框架都要进行框架的初始化，包括配置文件的处理、classpath 的扫描、类加载、注解的处理以及构建元模型，这些过程都是必不可少的，所以它们都比较耗费资源。如果使用了几种不同的框架，所耗费的资源也是成倍增加。

Quarkus 通过“左移shifting left”，把所有的资源开销大的操作都转移到构建阶段，解决了这些 Java 性能问题。在构建阶段进行代码和框架分析、字节码转换和动态元模型生成，而且只有一次，结果是：运行时可执行文件经过高度优化，启动非常快，不需要经过那些传统的启动过程，全过程只在构建阶段执行一次。



更重要的是：Quarkus 支持构建原生可执行文件，它具有良好性能…]]></summary>

Jerome Shidel

A few years ago, I wrote a command-line math program for FreeDOS called VMATH. It was capable of performing only extremely simple mathematical operations on very small unsigned integers. With some recent interest in basic math in the FreeDOS community, I improved VMATH to provide basic math support on signed 64-bit integers.
The process of manipulating big numbers using only 16-bit 8086 compatible assembly instructions is not straightforward. I would like to share some samples of the techniques used by VMATH. Some of the methods used are fairly easy to grasp. Meanwhile, others can seem a little strange. You may even learn an entirely new way of performing some basic math.
The techniques explained here …]]></summary>

The [ command, often called a "test," is a command from the GNU Core Utils package, and initiates a conditional statement in Bash. Its function is exactly the same as the test command. When you want to execute a command only when something is either true or false, use the [ or the test command. However, there's a significant difference between [ or test and [[, and there's a technical difference between those commands and your shell's versions of them.

The [ and the test commands, installed by the GNU Core Utils package, perform the same function using a slightly different syntax. (You might find it difficult to search for documentation using the single left-square bracket ch…]]></summary>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

2022 年，对我来说是不平凡的一年，键圈的兴亡成败在这一年格外明显。也是这一年我开始从一个消费者转变成一个创作者，遇到了更多的人，也想了了更多过去不会思考的问题。下面来讲讲我这一年的所思所想和所感，以及今后的一些打算。虽然都是些浅短的认识，但是分享出来也算是一种体验，非常感谢大家的观看和意见。欢迎评论区友好讨论。
键盘圈的大趋势
现代社会人与人的交流不再局限于过去话语和书信的形式，而更多倾向于快捷的网络输入交流。快捷频繁的信息互通使得输入工具成为生活工作长时间高频率接触的日常用品。2020 年的疫情提早将线上办公大规模地带入人们的生活之中，人们也重新开始审视自己的办公桌搭，机械键盘市场在疫情之下，不降反增。
机械键盘热度上涨这件事，无论是从日常生活中关于机械键盘话题讨论度愈发增高，还是从近些年来机械键盘品牌数急剧增加都可以得到一定程度的论证。
数据来源：什么值得买
近些年来，在机械键盘领域我能明显感知到的就是选择越来越多了，无论是量产还是客制化，无论是轴体、键帽、套件。国内机械键盘在「物质」水平上，毫无疑问的成长了。
在轴体领域，国产轴体自 2010-2012 开始萌芽，在 2019 年这个关键节点打出了名声，国内轴体市场也从 Cherry 的独角戏演变成现在的百家争鸣。
佳达隆的产品时间线 2012—2020
在键帽领域，过去的客制化玩家大多只能选择 GMK、SP 等海外品牌，如今有国产老牌客制化键帽 JTK、2019 年出现的 Domikey 和 2022 年入场的 PBTfans 以及各种各样的键帽代工厂，包括量产领域也出…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前天，我收到了腾讯官方发来的一个警告：


“因用户投诉并经平台审核，你的小程序涉嫌滥用小程序接口能力，影响用户体验行为。”


惊讶之下，我发现是我们几年前为了解决公众号文章内不能放置链接而开发的“文章助手”小程序被警告了。

众所周知，一般情况下，微信文章不能像网页一样放入链接的。对于一般的文字性内容，这其实并无大碍，但是对于我们这种技术类文章，常常会有一些链接，以便读者可以深入了解相关内容。因此，这种限制对我们来说是一种缺陷，为了解决这种问题，我们陆续想过几种方法，比如利用文末的“阅读原文”、在文章内注明完整链接等。最后，我们在 2019 年想到可以开发一个小程序来 辅助提供 这个链接。

通过一些 简单的方式，可以在你的微信文章中需要放置链接的地方嵌入这个“文章助手”小程序。用户只需要点击该小程序链接，即可显示该链接，并自动复制链接到剪贴板，然后只需要打开浏览器粘贴访问即可。

我自己对这种委曲求全的解决方案感觉比较满意。

现在，这个有两年没有继续添加新功能的小程序被警告了。于是我仔细查看了警告内容，在腾讯官方提供的《微信小程序平台运营规范》中是这样说的：


5.15.4 滥用操作剪切板接口

在用户使用剪切板功能进行复制操作后，恶意、强行中断小程序内功能服务或业务的完整流程，要求用户跳转或使用其他方式才可完整体验业务流程，影响用户体验。

用户未进行任何操作情况下，小程序默认读取用户剪切板信息。


考虑到申诉基本上不会得到解决（事实上我申诉了，也被驳回了），我只能修改相关代码，将以下行为做了调整：


不检测剪贴板内容长度（原本是为了避免当剪贴板内有较多内容而被覆盖）

不自动复制链接到剪贴板，而需要用户手动点击一下才复制


以我的估计，这样就不算滥用了吧？……

然而，新版本提交之后，紧接着，“文章助手”小程序就被封了剪贴板能力：


因用户投诉并经平台审核，发现帐号已发布的服务涉嫌滥用小程序接口能力，影响用户体验

已封禁服务的“操作剪贴板”能力


哑然。

无奈之下再次发起无用的申诉（已被驳回），并寻求客服解答。经过漫长的等待，客服给出了如下答复：


审核部门排查发现你的小程序内活动通过文本口令引导跳转其他渠道体验或进行，属于滥用剪切板能力 请开发者对小程序进行全面排查以及整改，将涉及违规的内容移除(包括但不仅限于内容展示、代码、路径等)，如有隐藏内容、路径、代码等，也需一并移除


呵，合着是不让用户粘贴链接到浏览器啊！

原本“文章助手”小程序内会提示用户“链接已复制，请在浏览器内粘贴打开”，看来这是摸了老虎屁股了。

而没有剪贴板能力的“文章助手”小程序，可以说是已经失去了一半用处。

那现在我有两个选择：


放弃这个小程序（这样我也不用每个月支付云开发的 20 元费用，需要说明的是，这个小程序是完全免费，没有任何广告和赞助，公益提供给任何人使用的）；

看看是否还有抢救的机会。


考虑到这个小程序已经累计有了 16 万用户，并为近 50 万个链接提供过服务，如果就此关闭，是对既往用户的不负责。因此，经过我灵机一动，我考虑可以完整地显示链接，让用户自己复制，至于复制后干什么，我不说，我也不知道，我也不想知道。

所以，你看的 0.4.7 版的“文章助手”就是这样了。

至于这样是否还会触犯腾讯的禁忌，我就不知道了，只能说，大家且行且珍惜吧。]]></summary>

太不巧整理，截自我的 Notion 页面
iPhone + iPhone OS 1 / iPhone 3G + iPhone OS 2
2007 年 1 月 9 日，乔布斯在初代 iPhone 的发布会上只用了一句话介绍其搭载的相机

看后面，最显眼的就是内置的 2 百万像素摄像头。
iPhone 发布会
 
关于相机方面大量的篇幅其实是在介绍照片软件，搭配 3.5 寸的可触摸屏幕，可以向左滑动或向右滑动查看照片，捏合放大缩小，横置手机的同时照片也跟着变换方向等。

第三个我想要展示给大家看的手机功能是照片。你知道的，我之前说过，在iPhone里内置有一台二百万像素的相机，我们也有着最酷的照片管理软件，它在移动设备中是最好的。但是我认为它在所有的平台中也都堪称最棒。这是我们的照片，我正在进入照片库，这就是照片库，在这里我可以用我的手指来滑动浏览照片，相当酷。让我们看看相册，我要选择意大利，让我们从第一张开始，我可以通过滑动手机来浏览这些照片。我可以翻看照片库，大家看这是一张风景照片，现在我调转了我的手机方向，然后它就变成了这个样子，酷吗？怎么样？当我在看这张风景照片的时候我也可以滑动它。怎么样？是不是看上去还不错？我还可以把一些照片放大，我能用我的手指来对它进行缩放。我可以让手指分开来让图片变大，酷不酷？我还能移动照片，怎么样，酷吗？还可以把照片设置为手机壁纸，这样就能设置成为壁纸。当我回到主页，然后锁屏，当我解锁之后，我设…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[之前，我在《论文读不懂怎么办？》一文中，给你介绍了论文阅读遇到问题时的几个解决方法。尤其是介绍了你可以求助的免费资源和路径，它们包括但不限于：

幻灯
博客
视频
课程
代码

那篇文章，在知乎上获得了 2600 个赞（截止 2022 年 10 月）。我相信，对于很多同学，起到了帮助。

只不过，环境和技术在变化，我们解决问题的方法和思路，也应该与时俱进。
这不，因为有了大规模自然语言处理模型的加持，阅读论文时遇到不认识的名词，或者无法理解作者的简单解释时，我们有了一种新的对策。
具体的方法，就是人工智能替你阅读后，把内容综合整理，结合上下文转换成简单清晰的语言，再反馈给你。
这个想法，其实并不新鲜了。翻看近几年自然语言处理领域的论文，你能看见不少相关的研究。
只不过，那些研究成果只存在论文中，或者是在某个实验室的电脑里面，普通人根本无法接触，更不要说利用了。
这回可不一样，有人（ \@amanjha__ and \@functionofjade）居然真的就做了个产品出来。
这个应用的名字，叫做 explainpaper ，非常直白吧？

使用起来也特别方便。不用去菜单里面点选找寻。只要你把论文传上去，高亮某一个词语、短语或者段落，人工智能就会自动为你解读。

不仅如此，你还可以就着 AI 反馈的结果，继续追问。
这种应用演示不大适合图文。所以我干脆为你做了 一段演示视频，你可以先看看。
 
 
看完之后，感受如何？
反正不少小伙伴表示，很兴奋。

这东西背后的技术是啥？当然还是咱们的老熟人 ------GPT-3.
其实 GPT-3 这模型的特点，说穿了就是大。因为模型庞大，参数众多，所以从海量语料库里积攒的「认知」就多。注意我这里刻意回避了「知识」这个词儿。

（资料来源：t.ly/cY1kn）
从上图中，你不难看到，现在的文本和代码生成中，GPT-3 都占据了重要位置。
我喜欢共享内容的原因之一，是视频发出后总可以获得观众进一步的反馈。不少的问题，都会激发我的思考。
例如有小伙伴在视频后面提问，说这个东西能不能帮着理解中文论文啊？

这是个很好的问题。毕竟很多国内人文社科研究生平时阅读的论文，更大比例是中文的。
我一开始觉得这个问题问得有些太贪心了。对于一个外国人做的刚上线应用，你指望人家立即支持阅读中文，还能看懂中文的研究论文，不大现实吧？
刚要回复，我突然想起来 上次在 Lex 上面的教训了。既然 explainpaper 的底层模型是 GPT-3 ，那它本来就该认得中文啊。
为了确保回答准确，还是实际测试一下吧。我传了一篇自己的论文上去。

中文划线高亮之后，AI 反馈的结果让我有些吃惊。
尽管 explainpaper 并不能直接用中文来解释信息。但它可以立即识别出「知识管理」就是 knowledge management ，然后进一步解释下去。
下面这段解释，就更有意思了。

它先广泛解释「插件」是啥，然后结合本文的上下文，指出 Roam Toolkit 是一种插件，并且描述了它的功能。
不仅如此，从下图可以看出，就连划线的时候字符之间出现了空格间隔，也依然能正常识别和解释。

下面，我故意找了个文中没有进行详细解释的「概念网络」，结果是这样的。

我能确定，这解释里面出现的「宠物」、「猫」、「狗」啥的，肯定没在本文正文出现过。
Evernote 这一段，让我愣住了。

Explainpaper 居然是准确识别了这张表格，并且把内容总结梳理，然后用英文输出了出来。
上述的演示，是不是回答了读者的问题呢？我觉得算不上。从需求分析来看，人家看中文论文遇到术语不清楚，自然是需要中文的解释。你再弄成英文给我，这......
可换个角度想想，这东西帮助外国人阅读中文论文，可是再好不过了。遇到中文专业词汇，随时可以获得准确的英文解释，而且阐述还贴合论文的上下文。外国人读中文论文，将减少很多障碍。这或许可以快速提升中文论文的影响力，妙啊！
另外，目前 explainpaper 缺乏中文解释能力，也给国内的开发者提供了发展空间。希望早日看到更多 AI 实际应用上线，帮助国人理解中文论文。
我期待你能自己尝试一下这款在线应用。至少在目前，它是免费的。而且因为上传的都是公开发表的论文，也不存在用户隐私泄漏问题。所以可以放心大胆地尝试 ------ 特别是对于最近要写文献综述的小伙伴来说。
欢迎你把自己测试的结果和经验心得，分享在留言区。咱们一起交流讨论。
祝论文阅读愉快！

得益于 Faster CPython 项目，Python 3.11 在性能方面提升巨大。在 Ubuntu Linux 上使用 Pyperformance 基准测试套件和 GCC 编译时，CPython 3.11 比 CPython 3.10 平均快 25%。根据你的工作负载，速度可能会提高 10-60%。


消息来源：Python



老王点评：之前 Guido 曾经希望能速度翻倍，但是看起来距离目标大打折扣啊。




欧洲理事会正式批准统一 USB-C 法案

10 月初，欧洲议会通过一项法案：自 2024 年起部分消费电子产品必须提供单一的 USB-C 充电接口。这项法案经欧洲议会主席和理事会主席签署生效后，将在 24 个月后开始实施。新规定将适用于广泛的便携式设备，而生效的 40 个月后，所有笔记本电脑的充电接口也将被规定使用 USB-C 接口。据数据，此前充电器每年产生约 11000 吨电子垃圾。


消息来源：MacRumors



老王点评：不管苹果乐意不乐意，它都得接受了。




Linux 考虑淘汰对英特尔 i486 CPU 的支持

Linux 内核在十年前移除对 i386 的支持后，i486 是内核主线对 x86 架构支持的最低版本，Linus Torvalds 认为应该让 x86-32 架构支持的最低版本提高到奔腾及更高版本。他指出 i486 已经被视为可以在博物馆里展示的展品，不如让它们运行博物馆版本的内核。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：嗯，确实，我在 1995 年买的第一台计算机就是 486DX266 的，这都快三十年了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[伴随 iOS 16.1 的发布，YaoYao 也适配了 iOS 16.1 相关功能
 
 
灵动岛
当你在手表上开始运动后，再打开手机App，你将发现YaoYao 的灵动岛功能。
灵动岛在 iPhone 14 Pro 上可以使用，你可以把灵动岛理解成一个indicator。

具体有多大用，实际我也没太明白，再就是要看这个功能提供后，各路厂商的想象力，以我自己的判断，Apple 可能也没太明白，这个应该会在后面继续迭代。
实时活动（Live Activity）
这个实时活动和灵动岛是一起的，绑定的，这也是我不太能理解的地方。它不需要iPhone 14 Pro，其他手机也会显示，你可以把它理解成一个特殊的通知.
它能实时显示新跳绳的运动数据，在 iPhone 14 Pro常亮屏的加持下更加好用，个人认为常亮屏是 iPhone 14 Pro 最大的亮点，就像 Apple Watch 自从有了常亮显示，体验大大提高一样。
Live Activity
Apple Watch Ultra 操作按钮（Action Button)
为了适配 Apple Watch Ultra 这个特殊的自定义键（Action Button，手表左侧这个黄色键），我特意买了一个 Ultra，现在在系统里配置该键后，你就可以：
 
 
1. 一键启动YaoYao
2. 按下该键暂停运动
3. 再按下恢复运动（或和右边的侧边键同时按下）
因为不用看屏幕可以直接按，减少了心智负担，实际使用非常好用！变成了我最喜欢 Ultra的功能。之前感觉佳明表全是按键操作，不能触控，拿到手完全不会用，感觉很傻，看来也有一定道理，哈哈。
Action Button 按键配置方法
Action Button 配置
请将App 更新到最新版，尝鲜以上功能。

Are you looking for a way to quickly transfer files from your Windows computer to your Linux computer and back again? The open source PSCP utility makes it easy to transfer files and folders, and of course it's open source.
Setting your PATH in Windows
Knowing how to set your command path in Windows makes it easier to use a handy utility like PSCP. If you're unfamiliar with that process, read how to set a PATH on Windows.
Using PSCP
PSCP (PuTTY Secure Copy Protocol) is a command-line tool for transferring files and folders from a Windows computer to a Linux computer.

Download pscp.exe from its website.
Move pscp.exe to a folder in your PATH (for example, Desktop\App if you followed the PA…]]></summary>

In the first part of this series, I illustrated what an Open Organization chart looks like based on the book Team of Teams, by Stanley McChrystal. In this second and final part, I explore concerns about the information flow using this chart and give some examples of how it might work and (possibly unknowingly) has worked in the past.
Building team-to-team adaptability, collaboration, and transparency
Sometimes activities fit exactly with a single specialty and group responsibility. Other times these responsibilities overlap, with one party having primary responsibility and another playing a more minor but important, supportive role.

The git log command offers many opportunities to learn more about the commits made by contributors. One way you might consume such information is by date. To view commits in a Git repository created on a specific date or range of dates, use the git log command with the options --since or --until, or both.

First, checkout the branch you want to inspect (for example, main):
$ git checkout main
Next, display the commits for the current date (today):
$ git log --oneline --since="yesterday"
Display commits for the current date by a specific author only (for example, Agil):
$ git log --oneline --since="yesterday" --author="Agil"
You can also display results for a range of dates. Display commits between any two dates (for example, 22 April 2022 and 24 April 2022):
$ git log --oneline --since="2022-04-22" --until="2022-04-24"
In this example, the output displays all the commits between 22 April 2022 and 24 April 2022, which excludes the commits done on 22 April 2022. If you want to include the commits done on 22 April 2022, replace 2022-04-22 with 2022-04-21.
Run the following command to display commits between any two dates by a specific author only (for example, Agil):
$ git log --oneline --since="2022-04-22" \
--until="2022-04-24" --author="Agil"

Reporting
Git has many advantages, and one of them is the way it enables you to gather data about your project. The git log command is an important reporting tool and yet another reason to use Git!

A progressive web app (PWA) is a web application that uses modern web technologies to deliver a user experience equal to any mobile app. An active open source community, in conjunction with tech leaders like Google and Microsoft, pushes the PWA agenda forward in an effort to "bridge the app gap."
Basically, a PWA runs your app in a web browser. Because there's essentially a two-party system of the Play and App stores, the focus is on two browsers: Google Chrome and Apple Safari (built on top of the open source Chromium and WebKit, respectively).
I won't be covering creating desktop apps. For more information on that topic, look into Electron.
PWAs are built the same way as any website or web app. They use the lates…]]></summary>

When I was around 5 years old, my father brought home our first computer. From that moment on, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in computers. I haven't stopped hanging around them since. During high school, when considering which specific area I wanted to focus on, I started experimenting with hacking, and that was the moment I decided to pursue a career as a security engineer.
I'm now a software engineer on the security compliance team. I've been at Red Hat for over two years, and I work remotely in the Czech Republic. I've used Linux for about 12 years, mainly Arch Linux and Fedora, but I've also administered Debian, Gentoo, and Ubuntu in the past.

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

为何是阅读器
大学毕业后，我告别了拥有海量藏书的图书馆，开始了漫长的阅读工具体验之旅。
起初，惯性思维让我从当当、京东等大平台买书来读。我喜欢撕掉新书塑封时的期待心情，也慢慢攒起来了自己的第一批库存。新书的开销几乎成为刚毕业的我除吃饭和租房外的第三大支出项。
后来，多抓鱼开始了他们的创业，我也成为了他们的最早一批用户。我在他们的小程序上养成了买二手书的习惯，也尝试着卖掉了一些看完的书。我喜欢这种循环与分享的理念，有时收到他人批注过的书页，时有共鸣，像是在和一名未曾谋面的老友会心一笑。
然而北漂不易，在这样试运行了快三年后，寸土寸金的租房空间已经难以下脚。再加上数次搬家几乎成了北漂的必修课，因此「纸质书」在我这里已经逐渐和「奢侈品」画了等号。我开始把目光转向电子书。
彼时「蜗牛阅读」早于「微信阅读」兴起，我用手机读完每天免费的一小时，眼睛已经感觉酸涩。后来我尝试了 iPad 版本，视觉的疲劳感依然没有好转。于是像每一个热爱阅读或者感觉自己热爱阅读的人一样，我下单了人生的第一台 Kindle，开始了我的阅读器泡面之旅。
Kindle 的小屏幕让我非常不适应。由于阅读惯性使然，为了尽可能获得和纸质书的一页近似的信息量，我需要把字体调整到很小，然而字体变小又让阅读本身变得吃力。加上 Kindle Unlimited 并不优质的资源和第三方网站的不稳定，我发现 Kindle 在我这里并没有代替纸质书的地位，反而是新鲜感过后，逐渐落入吃灰的境地。
再后来，得到 app 开始推出了电子书的业务，上线初期是 148元/年。我这个得到重度用户试用了…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[引言
iPad中关于键盘的设置与鼠标一样 —— 非常混乱。例如，iPad键盘的设置也是出现在「通用 | 键盘」、「辅助功能 | 键盘」以及「辅助功能 | 触控 — 辅助触控」中。
其中，「辅助功能 | 触控 — 辅助触控」其实就是上一篇文章中的「鼠标键」，具体可以参考《鼠标搭配 iPadOS，如何设置才能更好用？》
「通用 | 键盘 — 实体键盘」
键位调节
在实体键盘中，你可以根据iPad已有的输入法进行键位调节。例如我们常用的是QWERTY键盘，而你可以在这里改成AZERTY等。

 
下面的几项设置中，大家基本都能理解，而且也无关痛痒。笔者认为比较重要的是下面两个：
按下🌐显示表情符号
首先，这个🌐符号在妙控键盘里就是左下角的fn。
显示表情符号这个按钮，比较适合常用emoji😄的场景。例如‼️，一般写小🍠的朋友都需要用较多的emoji来分1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣等小标题，那么打开这个功能就会非常方便啦✨。
实际上，就算打开了这个功能，也不会影响我们切换输入法，因为使用control+空格也能轻松切换输入法，与我们使用Mac的习惯一样。

使用大写锁定键切换语言
第二个功能也是Mac中特有的功能。从Windows换到Mac的用户很不爽的一点是：想按Caplock键来输入大写字母，结果只能切换输入法，非得长按才行。
实际上这个功能是可以开关的，iPad上也一样。打开后，我们可以自由地在当前输入法和英文输入法之间切换（如果当前是简体中文输入法，那么就是中——英；如果是俄语输入法，那么便是俄——英），如果在键盘语言中把英文输入法删除的话，这个功能即使打开也不能使用了。关闭后，我们按下Caplock键就能切换为全大写输入。macOS中也一样，删除自带的中文输入法（英文输入法不能删除），就不能实现这个功能。

「辅助功能 | 键盘」

辅助功能中的键盘设置分为两个部分，一个是…]]></summary>

如果你想减脂增肌，或者厌倦了在普通健身房对着满屋子器械不知从何下手，CrossFit 训练也许是一个最简单粗暴的健身方案。

融合有氧器械、哑铃壶铃、药球、奥林匹克举重与单杠和吊环体操动作， CrossFit 以社区感、团课、每天不重样的训练内容闻名。对，我们每天练的项目都不一样，它要求你什么都懂（一点），对心肺、力量、柔韧性等各方面都有要求。
换句话说， CrossFit 花样丰富，有趣，强度大，但作为一个相对小众的运动，准入门槛也不低。如果你在一二线城市，找到好馆子的可能性会比较大。如果你经常出差—— CrossFit 就像健身界的星巴克，无论到哪个城市，都能找到以相似模式运行的 Box ，能结识不同的朋友。
全球 CF 馆分布
今年是我练 CF 的第三年。根据三年的观察，许多来 CF 新客体验的人常被这项运动的强度或者“对新人不友好”震慑，觉得这是一馆子又壮又爱拼命的疯子。但其实 CF 并没有想象中这么吓人。在进行你的第一次 CF 训练之前，提前知道这些事情可以降低你在馆里低血糖、呕吐或者被吓得从此听到 CF 就绕道走的概率。
离你最近的 CrossFit 训练馆在哪里？
首先，如何找到离你最近的 CF 训练馆？如果你在国内一线城市，在点评 app 里输入 CrossFit 就是最快的方法，如果搜索结果中出现【综合训练】字样，它很有可能也是一个 CF 馆。只是未经 CF 官方认证。这不代表它是山寨——近几年有越来越多场馆认为自己不需要每年缴会费做这个认证，但大家训练的系统是一样的。
如果你在国外，除了谷歌，另一个方法是点进 crossfit.com 网页，在右上角 Find a gym 这里找到经过官方认证的场馆（对国内场馆同样适用，但也许网速会众所周知地慢一点）…]]></summary>

When you launch an application on an operating system, there are certain code libraries and utility applications that your OS needs to use for that app to run. Your OS knows how to find these libraries and utilities because it has a system path, a map to common shared data that lots of apps need. Every OS has this, but users aren’t usually aware of it because they don’t usually need to care about it. However, when you start coding or using special network utilities or commands, you might care about your own PATH variable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[写在前面
这个标题其实已经被我修改了一下，因为一边上学一边写稿偶尔真的拖延爆炸。在这之前，其实标题是：“灵动岛到底好不好”。如今我也算是吃了豹子胆，敢直接标题下结论。虽然已经离发布会过了很多天，当时的情绪也已经逐渐稀释，还是想尽可能理性的去一点点解释，为什么不好。
我并不想在文章的一开头就给自己贴上标签，一方面是不喜欢这样的做法，另一方面也是此时的我并没有什么拿得出手的名堂。很多观点都是超级主观的，但也很高兴你能来看看！谢谢你，我的朋友！希望你看的开心！

“好不好”的尺度
对于灵动岛，我感觉我们都有着一样的一条曲折心路：发布会前被剧透难看的感叹号挖孔，发布会时被灵动岛的亮相视频惊艳到再次对苹果重拾希望，但第二天起床琢磨过劲——这也是我们出现分歧的地方：我们都想知道这究竟是另一个 Touch Bar，还是一个能定义 iPhone 接下来几年发展的新设计。
要想搞清楚这个问题，我想讲个有些偏题的故事。
来到伦敦后，一个人住一个只有17平米的房子，空虚寂寞冷的时候也会想用音乐填满自己的房间。于是就在亚马逊上看了看各种音箱。我目前使用的电脑是14寸的 MacBook Pro，但长期会连着一个明基的显示器来用，所以我对这个音箱购买就列下了几条条件：

音质不能比 mac 本身差
必须有 aux，这样我能连接显示器用，受不了蓝牙的音画不同步
能放在显示器的正下方，所以不能太大
好看，别太贵…

在网上看了一圈，我特别喜欢 Marshall 的 EMBERTON II，当时加上一点学生优惠不到100英镑就能拿下。我觉得它小巧精致，光是凭借这好看的皮囊我就快按耐不住自己的购买欲了。可是它却有一个地方不能满足我的需求，它没有 aux，纯蓝牙。当时我的内心就出现了两股力量：一股力量准备 pua 自己，让自己接受蓝牙的延迟；另一股力量开始嘲讽 Marshall 这个品牌的一些关于“音质”和“品…]]></summary>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

实话实说，最近软件圈的「玩具」有点儿多。
笔记软件，有 Tana；浏览器，有 Arc；Readwise 新出的一站式阅读器 Reader ，也很不错。
没想到，我又在 Jarod 的知识星球里看到他推荐了一款在线编辑器：LEX。
要来了一个邀请链接后，原本我是打算先留着，有空再仔细尝试。但是，一进入 LEX 的界面，读了官方的介绍，我立刻就不淡定了。

其实，哪里只是我一个人不淡定啊？
Building the Second Brain 作者 Tiago Forte 说，自己已经看到要失业的迹象了。原来，在他用 LEX 试写的一篇文章里，他自己只写了 5 个词儿。
剩下全是 AI 顺着往下编。

至于效率类 YouTube 播主 Ali Abdaal 更是「恶作剧」：他用 LEX 创作了一篇「15 个效率技巧」，拆成一串推文发了出来，结果成了自己反响最热烈的推文。（事后他向大家公开了内容来源。）

当然，Ali 是名人，浏览量是有名人效应的。即使如此，人工智能的作品几乎骗过了所有人的眼睛，还收获了这么多的点赞和转发，这就厉害了。
下面说说我自己的实际测试结果吧。下图中，只有红框里面的文字，是我写的。然后后面的段落，全都是 LEX 自动补全的。

更厉害的是，根据这些内容，LEX 自动生成了若干标题，我只是从中选了一个而已。

LEX 基于风头正劲的 AI 文本生成引擎 GPT-3。其实，原本 GPT-2 时代，人工智能自动补全已经大显神通了。GPT-3 的应用，意味着写出来的东西更真假难辨。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近几年区块链逐渐火热以后，「去中心化」的概念逐渐受到关注。
去中心化指的是：在一个分布有众多节点的系统中，每个节点都具有高度自治的特征。
回想一下，你的各种私有资料都储存在哪里？
文档都在 WPS 的云盘，或者散落在各种文件夹中；
音频文件可能分散在网易云音乐、QQ 音乐、酷狗等等音频平台，如果你喜欢音乐的本地化，也许会下载到某个文件夹中；
至于相片这种更为私人的东西，则有可能在手机本地相册或者选择百度网盘、iCloud 等等网络云盘中。
我们经常会把同类的文件分散在各处，当我们想去寻找的时候却往往难以在一个确定的地方查询；又或者遭遇到了平台倒闭，难以取回储存在云空间中的珍贵资料。
所以对于文件的「中心化」储存和管理，是一个值得尝试的文件管理形式。
我认为其中有三个核心：集中管理、本地优先、在线引用
将「中心化」概念运用到相册管理中
比如图片的管理，拿我的个人相册举例。
我们的手机每天都会有很多图片产生：屏幕截图、自拍、风景等等照片，但并非所有的照片都值得长期保存，所以要定期清理无关照片，备份重要的相片。

我从大学时期就开始使用谷歌相册管理我的手机相片，这个堪称当下功能最强大的在线相册，会智能地自动备份相机拍下的所有照片、屏幕截图，甚至还有其他 APP 中保存的图片。同时也可以一键清理本地已备份的图片，节省手机空间。
五年多过去了，我的谷歌相册中积攒了无数张相片，其中超过一半以上的图片都是无关的废片，混杂在各种较为重要的照片中，我花了很长时间都难以删除这些图片。
于是我国庆期间我批量下载了所有的相片，大约 5w 张，其中绝大部分图片都是各种被自动备份的无关照片，经过大约三天的筛选，最终保留下了差不多 7000 多张照片。
那么问题来了，如何让我的相册不再受到污染，能够自动备份到谷歌相册中，而且我希望能够保留一份相册在本地，在我删除本地照片的时候自动在云端也删除。
我采取的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2022国庆七天，秋高气爽良辰美景怎可辜负？驾驶着 Model 3，带上小米 11 Ultra，一路向西北从惠州到桂林。

Model 3 标续版提车于2021 年 12 月，表显续航 423 公里，1.6 万公里后表显降为 418 公里。
去程全长 627 公里，途径佛山百利达广场特斯拉超充站充电一次约 15 分钟，在贺州境内高速上充电一次约 25 分钟。
佛山百利达广场特斯拉超充站选址非常好，就在高速出入口附近，上下高速很方便。贺州境内高速上的快充表现不错，功率一度飙到充电 800 km/h 以上。

提车至今对 Model 3 的续航表现基本满意，天气凉爽的情况下表显多少就能跑出多少，甚至有时候实际续航还会超出表显，不同天气状况下的真实续航表现可以看我的 B 站自驾游视频。
晚霞迎接我们一路向西
到达桂林市临桂区已是晚上 10 点 15 分左右，办好入住第一件事就是去吃一碗桂林米粉。可能因为去的是商业步行街，美食比较商业化，即使当时比较饿了，这碗粉也没有给我带来美味的感觉。

重头戏在第二天的龙脊梯田之旅。龙脊梯田位于桂林龙胜县东南部和平乡境内的龙脊山。龙脊梯田距龙胜县城27公里，距桂林市80公里，景区面积共66平方公里，梯田分布在海拔300至1100米之间，坡度大多在26至35度之间，最大坡度达50度。
从临桂区去龙脊梯田景区大门口要一个半小时左右，桂林真大啊，查了下比北京还要大 1 万多平方公里
根据疫情防控要求，散客只能在景区收费处外面的广场购票，票价 80 元/成年人，和售票处价格一致。
工作人员告知我们，双向单车道的蜿蜒的山路加上堵车，从景区售票处到龙脊梯田里的几个寨子还要差不多 1 个小时的车程。国庆期间人特别多，如果按常规路线开车去名气最大的大寨，开车到坐缆车的地方要 1 个多小时，排队花钱坐缆车还要1个多小时，工作人员收费给我们指明了一条别的路去千层天梯，美景不打折，还可以开车到达。

工作人员收费指明的这条路应该是尚未完全开发的新路，路上看到了多处没有做固化工程的山坡，不少路段有落石和滑坡泥土，还有一个地方路面塌方，行驶起来要格外小心。
使用长焦拍下这张照片，脑海里突然响起《断背山》的配乐，给人一种氛围宁静的感觉
一个多小时后终于达到千层天梯，话不多说欣赏美景吧，看看小米 11 Ultra 记录的龙脊梯田，先来一张全景图。

这张全景图是在千层天梯处拍的，当天天空中飘着淡青蓝色的烟雾，有一种烟雨朦胧的感觉，阳光洒在稻田上勾勒出明暗的分界线，小米 11 Ultra 非常好地还原了真实的色彩和光影。
当时在梯田附近一家民宿停车吃饭，两荤一素一共三个菜（牛蛙+鱼+青菜+米饭）加免费停车 120 元左右，坐在民宿楼下的台阶上吃饭吹风欣赏美景十分惬意，可以说物超所值。

使用小米 11 Ultra 以来最满意的就是它的长焦表现，镜头压缩空间集中表达内容可以拍出非常有故事感的照片。以下照片应该都是 5x-30x 范围内拍摄的（具体记不清了），画质表现超出预期，当天的良好光线也功不可没。
 后期调色套了滤镜
11 Ultra 的主摄表现不错，成片有光影层次，色彩过渡自然，数码味和锐化较少，和肉眼所见十分接近。

当然，小米 11 Ultra 拍照也不是十全十美的，成像慢、多颗摄像头切换动画生硬、逆光自拍效果一般、超级夜景容易糊等等。不过考虑到 3699 元的价格，这些问题也都可以忽略了。
最后附上一些桂林游玩期间的美图（部分有后期），推荐大家去桂林玩，一座现代和古典，先锋流行和土著闲适相结合的奇妙城市，当地人比较友善，这次去也没遇到宰客行为，花费物超所值，值得一去。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[灵动岛是今年iPhone的热点更新。我们在早期的时候，看到了很多针对灵动岛的玩法，比如在岛的周围养宠物、用灵动岛打游戏、适配灵动岛的挖孔壁纸等。
但是，这些玩法从系统和功能层面，并没有用到真正的“灵动岛接口”。在苹果开发者文档中，灵动岛实际上是一种“实时活动”。在某些用户需要实时关注状态变化的场景下，为用户展示信息。比如实时更新比赛数据、实时更新外卖进度、实时更新计时器、实时更新地图导航指引等等。
如果iPhone安装了iOS 16.1系统，在iPhone 14 Pro机型上，实时活动可以在灵动岛和锁屏界面展示；而在非iPhone 14 Pro机型，则只在锁屏界面展示。

OneWidget如何定位灵动岛？
仔细阅读苹果开发者文档之后，我们发现实时活动的实现方式和小组件有非常多重叠的地方。同时，不管在锁屏界面还是“展开的”灵动岛位置，它的尺寸都很像中尺寸的桌面小组件。再者，实时活动不能够交互、也不能有动画、不能随时刷新，这些和小组件都太像了。所以，我们最终把实时活动定位成“一种特殊的小组件”。
当我们把“灵动岛”定义为“实时展示的小组件”，那么一切就更简单了，原则上小组件能够实现的它都可以实现。只是我们需要额外思考，在锁屏和灵动岛这两个特殊的位置，用户凭什么要展开来用它。
OneWidget怎么做灵动岛功能？
在迭代产品的2年多时间里，OneWidget的各种类型的小组件从用户那里得到了很多不错的回馈。当我们复盘这些小组件，用户最关心的是三个关键词：实用、美观、趣味。所以，设计灵动岛这个特殊的小组件，我们应该做的也是实用、美观、趣味。另外补充一点，对于很多用户来说，美观、趣味也是一种实用价值，美观带来个性化的装饰、趣味带来功能的尝鲜探索。
从实用和便捷角度，我们设计了“启动之岛”和“健康之岛”。
从美观和趣味角度，我们设计了“宠物之岛”和“摆烂之岛”。

如何开启灵动岛？
如果iPhone更新到iOS 16.1以上，下载OneWidget 的3.6.0以上的版本之后，可以进入个人中心找到主入口。在灵动岛配置页面，选择需要开启的“岛屿”，当App进入后台或者切换到其他App，实时活动就已经开启在了锁屏界面和灵动岛区域。
配置入口我们还单独设计了一些细节：会动的海平面、开启后的彩色提示框、预览效果等。

宠物之岛
用户可以在“宠物之岛”领养一个自己的电子宠物，它每天陪你玩、会饿、会困、会渴，在不同的状态下用户需要点击不同的操作。我们给宠物取了一个名字叫做“岛岛”，领养之后，在App内还会显示领养的天数。岛岛除了不同的状态，也有可能会出去玩耍，只有等他回来才能再次跟他互动。为了满足个性化，宠物“岛岛”还允许自定义颜色，现在我们支持了7种颜色的切换。

启动之岛
“启动之岛”可以允许用户添加快速启动App或者小程序的入口，常驻在锁屏界面和灵动岛里，展开之后即可点击一键直达的App。用户可以添加1~6的常用启动入口，根据添加的数量变化，图标和间距会自动调整来适应合适的布局。和锁屏小组件、桌面小组件一行，这里的启动器入口支持添加常用的App、微信支付宝的二级路径、微信和支付宝的小程序入口。

摆烂之岛
“摆烂之岛”将随机展示一些“反鸡汤”的插画和文案。这个功能为了满足“趣味性”，该卷的时候卷，该躺的时候也要好好躺。偶尔摆烂无可厚非，休息是人之常情。

健康之岛
“健康之岛”实时展示用户当天的健康数据，比如步数、运动时间、消耗能量、身高、体重等。尤其是对于每日会更新变动的数据，是可以查看更新数据的（不过目前系统刷新问题，会有较多延迟）。

 
以上就是OneWidget关于灵动岛功能的思考和功能的介绍。希望帮助大家了解灵动岛，也能够帮助大家通过这些小功能体验到灵动岛（实时活动）的用法。我们将继续做好一个“装修产品”，带来更多实用、美观、有趣的功能。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi 大家好呀！我叫 Ask Term 。这是我来少数派写的教程系列文章的第一篇，给大家带来一个开源知识库 Memos 的部署教程，小伙伴们也许会问 Memos 什么？那么我就把官方对 Memos 的定义引用一下：

An open source, self-hosted knowledge base that works with a SQLite db file.

如何还是不太清楚这个是干嘛用的，那么体验一下官方的 Demo，体验过的小伙伴一定会觉得这不就是 Flomo 吗？确实，这算是非官方 Flomo 的开源替代品，鉴于 Memos 的开源特性你可以随意的部署在自己的服务器上去使用。
Memos 的部署也很简单，一条 Docker 命令就能启动，但是对于不熟悉 Docker 的小伙伴或许还是有些难度的，为此我写了这篇入门级的教程，让小伙伴能够轻松完成 Memos 的部署。
Flomo 和 Memos 的功能对比


对比FlomoMemos
收费方式免费有限制开源自托管
API 接口Pro 版免费使用免费开放
每日回顾Pro 版支持支持
微信输入支持不支持


通过对比我认为 Memos 除了在微信输入上欠缺了一点，在其它方面是胜过 Flomo 的，虽然不能够原生的支持微信输入，但是 Memos 官方开放了 API 接口，通过这个接口去连接个人的微信服务号或许可以实现微信输入的功能，网上也有类似通过 Telegram 进行输入的教程。
 
🔞注意：本次的部署环境为： Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
Docker 的安装
附上 Docker 官方部署文档（如果需要更详细的安装流程，请参考官方文档）
如果已经存在旧版本的 Docker并且想要卸载请执行卸载命令（非必要）
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine dock…]]></summary>

住宿&交通🚌
市区住宿：Best Western Plus Welcome Hotel Frankfurt

📍 Leonardo-da-Vinci-Allee 2, 60486 Frankfurt am Main, Germany
⏳ 入住：下午3点，退房：上午11点
🔗 https://www.bestwestern.de/

这家宾馆距离机场十几分钟的车程，和市中心罗马广场也是差不多的距离。宾馆的旁边有超市，可以购买水果和零食。宾馆的马路对面就是轻轨车站，可以乘坐17路去往市区，换乘地铁可以到达罗马广场，交通还算便利。如果是在入住时间前到达的宾馆，可以先把行李寄存在一楼。运气好的话，有房间空出来的时候，也可以在早晨就办理入住。
和宾馆相隔一个街区，就是一个公园。公园的入口处有几家小餐馆。公园里有篮球场，能看到很多青少年在玩儿街头篮球，也有不少推着婴儿的家庭来这里活动。
从房间往外看，能看到金融区的高楼大厦
小镇住宿：PK Parkhotel Kurhaus

📍 Kurhausstraße 28, 55543 Bad Kreuznach, Germany
⏳ 入住：下午3点，退房：上午11点
🔗 http://www.parkhotelkurhaus.com/

Bad Kreuznach是距离法兰克福约一小时车程的一个温泉镇，也是很多人们来度假的地方，所以宾馆不少。PK Parkhotel Kurhaus是一家四星级宾馆，但不巧的是入住的时候宾馆正在翻新，遇到了暖气不热等问题。这家宾馆毗邻一条河，附近有一座建于中世纪的桥，是个散步的好去处。

这篇文章阐述了我认为以 Surface 为代表的 Windows 平台笔记本的通病，提供了一些不成功的解决方案，并展示更换到 MacBook 后的使用体验。

如果你和我一样是一名研究生，日常工作内容主要是阅读文献、写论文（撰写 Latex 代码）、写代码以及做 PPT。读完这篇文章，也许你想试试使用 MacBook Pro 继续你的工作
如果你被近期新发布的 Surface 系列笔记本吸引，正在持币观望，不妨读完这篇文章再决定是否入手最新的 Surface 系列

为什么倒戈来得这么晚
我的软粉生涯开始于 2015 年，彼时 Surface Pro 4 发布。全新的二合一形态笔记本让我觉得手里的 MacBook Air 瞬间不香了。2016 年，拿到大学录取通知书的那天晚上，我下单了一台 Surface Pro 4，从此开始了我的 7 年 Surface 使用生涯。在这期间有无数理由让我不再使用 Surface 系列， 而让我留下的理由只有一个——迷人的外观。
最开始购买了一台丐版 Surface Pro 4，在我大二转入计算机专业后，这台 Surface Pro 4 的性能就捉襟见肘了。 于是我将它换成了一台顶配的 Surface Book 1。这台 Surface Book 1 伴随了我 5 年多的时间，更换过一次屏幕，两次底座（均为内部电池发生鼓包）。在日常使用时，这台电脑经常发热（有时候合上盖子风扇也不停），时不时还会出现…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[作为在大城市工作的年轻人，租房是一个永远都绕不开的“时髦”话题。能够拥有一个舒适的小窝，让自己在忙碌一天之后彻底放松和沉静下来，对我来说应该是每天最触手可及的快乐。但是，租来的房子总有各种不尽如人意的地方，而且受限于房东的要求、时间、财力等问题，也不可能像小红书家居博主的租房视频一样进行大改，所以，我将我的小屋改造计划关键词定为：小改小造。当然，所谓的修补也不可能是一步到位的，经过了小半年的边住边搞，到现在才基本完成了一开始的大部分设想。如果你和我一样也有想要小改小造的想法，那么我希望这篇文章可以对你有一些帮助。
（本文有可能巨长，请耐心地看这篇流水账~）
租来的基本状况
本着不在路上花过多时间，并且要最大化个人生活空间的原则，我选择租公司附近两公里范围内的一室户，这不可避免地限制了我的很多租房想法。除去价格不菲的商用公寓和城中村，几乎就已经没有其他的选项，所以选来选去，只能做出妥协，定了一个小区里的公寓楼。
户型状况
我租到的是一室一厅的户型，但这栋公寓都有一个致命的缺点——客厅不见光。没有办法，租房不可能样样完美，考虑到白天几乎都在工作，周末和假期也尽可能逼迫自己出门浪而不是在家里发霉，所以也就勉强接受了这个缺陷。总的来说，这个户型面积相对可观，除了一些无法改动的分区（例如卫生间和厨房），其余还是有很多空间可以利用。
我家的简单户型图
室内状况
这栋公寓大多数房源，都归属于几个来深圳避寒的东北大姐，难得我这间的房东是一个系那个对年轻的国企深二代。但房东自己并不是一个乐于布置的人，房间里大多数的设施都是为了方便他做铲屎官，所以除了还算认真地定制了柜子、装了电视以及摆了一个还能用的沙发。
总的来说，租来的状况仅仅是个凑活，对我而言还远远不能达到拎包入住的状态。好在我个人也有一些从上一个家带来的“资产”，和一些软装的小计划，因此这个水平也刚好给了我一些发挥的空间。于是，漫漫“…]]></summary>
