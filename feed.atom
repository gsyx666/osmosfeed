YouTube TV, Google’s take on cable TV, could soon let viewers watch up to four live streams simultaneously in a new feature called “Mosaic Mode” reports Protocol. That’s according to a non-public presentation Google gave to its smart TV hardware partners, in which the search giant also discussed optimizations coming for YouTube Shorts on the big screen, as well as new YouTube Music functionality. 
Mosaic Mode brings to mind a similar feature that was available with Sony’s now-defunct PlayStation Vue service. Although it was announced in a presentation for Google TV and Android TV hardware manufacturers, Protocol notes that the feature is likely to eventually arrive on non-Android smart TVs from Samsung and LG given that Google likes to...

There comes a time when it is inevitable to work with Calendar. Sometimes it is easy, but be aware, it can be very tricky 😅
So let's have some fun with it 👍
Assume you have to compare two different Date values.
let date1 = Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 0) // 1970-01-01 00:00:00 
let date2 = Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 60 * 60 * 24) // 1970-01-02 00:00:00

Ano ngaba ang trimStart method sa Javascript?
Spaces like '\n' and '\t' included sila sa trimming btw
Pano gamitin:
const x = "    hello    ";
console.log( x.length ) // 

//Return Value
console.log( x.trimStart() ) // hello     
console.log( x.trimStart().length ) // 9


bumaba yung length ng na trim, kasi nga nawala yung mga spaces sa unahan :) ehehe.
// Di naapektuhan yung original string
console.log( x ) //      hello    
console.log( x.length ) // 13

Microsoft could be preparing to name its next big OS update as the “Windows 11 2022 Update.” References to this naming have appeared in near-final versions of the next big Windows 11 release, currently named 22H2. Twitter user XenoPanther spotted the Windows 11 2022 Update naming in the Get Started app that appears when you setup a new PC.
The naming could simply be a placeholder, or it could indicate Microsoft is finally simplifying its often confusing update names for Windows. We’ve seen a variety of names over the years, including the Creators Update naming for a big Windows 10 update, more mundane naming like the Windows 10 May 2021 Update, and more recently the Windows 10 21H2 moniker.

Meta has confirmed that it’s internally prototyping a new Instagram feature that’s suspiciously similar to BeReal, the social media app that’s recently exploded in popularity. The so-called “IG Candid” feature discovered by leaker Alessandro Paluzzi mirrors BeReal by prompting the user to share an authentic photo at a random time each day.
My colleague Casey Newton has taken to calling these imitators “murder clones,” because of how they appear designed to neutralize upstarts by imitating their killer features.
Paluzzi posted a screenshot with Instagram’s description of how the feature could work. “Add other’s IG Candid to your story tray. And everyday at a different time, get a notification to capture and share a Photo in 2 Minutes,”...

Someone in the remote castles of $bigcloudprovider must still know about how to implement firewalls, how to elastically scale message queues and databases.

What is this about? It's about providing a smoother and safer authentication to the masses. How? Using your fingerprint or face to register/login for instance. And of course, it's not sent to the server! If you want to try out and learn more about it, just go to the website, there is a really basic demo and explanations.
What I'm developing right now is a "public service" allowing anyone to register/login passwordlessly. It's really easy and more secure (for an in-depth explanation, check the website).

那么实际情况是什么？

把一个大家可以免费使用的发行版变成了不稳定的开发版本，红帽真的这么不厚道么？我一直想写点东西来以正视听，直到我看到了 Stef Walter（他是红帽雇员，高级总监，软件工程（全球）。负责 RHEL 和 Satellite 的大部分工作：服务、应用堆栈、安装、升级、镜像构建等等）的博文《CentOS Stream 是持续交付的》，我知道我不需要写任何东西了，只需将它翻译成中文就已足够。为了方便大家理解，在原文译文的基础上，我加了很多注释。

通过这篇译文，我们可以找到下面问题的答案：


红帽为什么要做这个转变？

红帽的开发模式发生了哪些变化？

Stream和RHEL的异同在哪里？

Stream稳定么？


持续交付 101：持续做苦难的事情，它们就会变得容易！

从外界看来，我们构建 RHEL（包括 CentOS Linux）的方式十多年来似乎没有什么变化。但在幕后，我们正在进行一场巨大的改革，即如何在不影响客户的情况下开发 RHEL。

我在很多的会议上讲述过这个故事，但有关 CentOS Linux 8 和 CentOS Stream 的公告推动了我在这里讲述这个故事。

三年前（原文发布于 2020 年，因此这里是 2017 年），我们几个在 RHEL 工程部工作的人有了一个想法：如果我们将现代化的开发实践…]]></summary>

NetworkManager was introduced in 2004 to make network configuration more flexible and dynamic. The old SystemV startup shell scripts, of which the interface configuration files were a part, were incapable of handling WiFi, wired, VPNs, broadband modems, and more—or at least incapable of doing it quickly or efficiently.
In a series of articles, I've written about why I'm a fan of NetworkManager and how I've used it. In part 1, I looked at what NetworkManager does and some of the tools it provides for viewing network connections and devices. In that article, I mentioned that NetworkManager does not need interface configuration files for most…]]></summary>

LaTeX 文件准备系统有一段有趣的历史。在 1968 年，程序员 Don Knuth 用一种老式印刷排版方式，撰写了他的第一本书《计算机程序设计艺术The Art of Computer Programming》。当他在 1976 年出版第二版时，出版商已经转向现代照相排版技术。

Knuth 对新版本的外观不满意。他从程序员的角度解决问题，决定创建他自己的文字处理系统，这样以后他出版的书就可以以相同格式排版，拥有相同的外观。因此，Don Knuth 在 1978 年编写了第一版 TeX 。

几年后，Leslie Lamport 创建了一组宏定义，以便作者更容易编写复杂文档。Lamport 的宏定义扩展，即 LaTeX，有效地扩展了 TeX 能够轻松创建各种文档。例如，许多学术组织使用 LaTeX 出版期刊和论文集。

Xiaolang Zhang has pled guilty to stealing trade secrets from Apple, where he worked on a self-driving car project from 2015 to 2018 (via CNBC). When he quit his job at Apple, he told his supervisor that he was going to work for Guangzhou Xiaopeng Motors Technology, a Chinese EV startup also known as Xpeng. 
During an investigation, which you can read more about here, Apple determined that he had transferred around 24GB of “highly problematic” data to his wife’s laptop via AirDrop, and had also taken circuit boards and a server from the company’s autonomous vehicle lab. 


The terms of Zhang’s plea agreement aren’t publicly available, but according to a court document uploaded by CNBC (pdf), Zhang pled guilty to the single theft of trade...

This comes after Reynaldo Mota Frias, a worker at the facility, died on July 13th, during the Prime Day rush, on a day when temperatures rose to 92 degrees. Amazon reportedly blames Frias’ death on “a personal medical condition” and denies reports that he told managers he was feeling unwell. An investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (or OSHA) is listed as ongoing.
Another employee at EWR9 told NBC that the warehouse gets hot, even in areas that have fans. The company has faced criticism from workers before about how it handles workloads during the i...

Sony’s PlayStation VR2 headset is coming in “early 2023,” according to posts the company made on Twitter and Instagram. Sony has been trickling information out about the upcoming headset over the past several months, and now we have at least a timeframe for when we can expect to get our hands on the hardware. 
While the company released details of the headset’s design earlier this year, it still hasn’t announced a price. It is, however, promising a lot for the PlayStation VR2 — it’ll feature displays that add up to 4K resolution and can run at 90 or 120Hz, have a 110-degree field of view, and use foveated rendering, which renders certain parts of the image as sharper than others to make things easier for the computer (or, in this case,...

Embracer Group is moving development on the upcoming Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR) remake for PS5 and PC from Aspyr Media to a Saber Interactive studio in Eastern Europe, according to Bloomberg.
The game, announced last September in a short trailer during a Sony showcase, was originally being made by Aspyr, which is known for its ports of KOTOR and KOTOR II. But development on the remake was paused after a demo was shown to Lucasfilm and Sony, Bloomberg reported in July. 
Saber had been helping with development on the remake, but a cryptic statement in Embracer’s earnings report last week seemed to suggest that Saber could be officially taking over. “One of the Group’s AAA projects has transitioned to another studio...

We may need to wait longer for the 3nm MacBook than we’d previously hoped. New 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros are on the horizon, according to a new prediction from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, but they’re unlikely to be the 3nm process. Refreshes of the excellent professional MacBooks “will enter mass production” in Q4 of 2022, Kuo tweeted this morning.
Kuo’s intel indicates that they “may still adopt the 5nm advanced node,” which is the same process node that the recent M2 MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models use. That would, if true, mean that Apple’s first 3nm MacBook chips, also rumored to be entering production later this year, will not debut in these machines.

 Intel is building what it claims is the “largest silicon manufacturing location on the planet” in Ohio, and it’s going to need 7,000 workers to construct it, according to a report from the Associated Press. However, a labor shortage affecting the construction industry could make it hard to recruit the workers it needs for the $20 billion job, and competition for workers could slow the pace of homebuilding in the area which is needed to support the growing workforce that Intel’s plant is supposed to attract.
Intel first announced the Ohio project in January of this year and is on track to begin construction in late 2022. Once finished, the 1,000-acre site will house two factories, or fabs, and employ at least 3,000 people. But it has...

作为一个法学生，我的日常生活主要围绕在上课、论文、实习以及我杂七杂八的爱好上。今天在这里跟大家聊一聊我是如果进行任务管理的。
我的任务管理系统
软件的选择
从2017年接触滴答清单以来，滴答清单变得功能越来越丰富。熟悉这款软件的人都知道，如今的滴答清单已经不单单是一款Todo  List软件了，而是一款融合日历、笔记、清单、习惯打卡、番茄钟的“综合性”软件。
我相信大多数的“少数派”们都是“Less is more”的坚实簇拥者，看到现在的滴答清单一定也会和我一样不自觉的想起国产的印象笔记，觉得这是一款什么都做却又什么都做不好的软件。因此从2017年接触这款软件后，我很快又转向了Things、Omnifocus、Todoist、Anydo、2Do、微软Todo、Reminder……
不夸张的说，从2016年接触GTD概念后的我，基本用过市面上各式各样的GTD软件，但是时隔多年，2016年的我刚刚进入大学，如今的我研究生也已经快要毕业了，在经历过不同环境下各种工作流的转换，兜兜转转我还是回到了滴答清单，原因无他，唯性价比高、满足我的需求、稳定矣。
化繁为简
虽然现在的滴答清单功能复杂，但好在这款软件还是给我们“Less is more”的选择，即仅选择我们用得到的功能，隐藏那些我们用不到的功能
滴答清单的功能模块隐藏
就我个人而言，我把滴答清单仅作为我的Todo List和日历，因此也就只选择了这两个功能模块。除了能够隐藏部分“功能”，在滴答清单里，还能够做到隐藏“视图”、“标签”等，将“Less is more”的观点贯彻到底，对于显示什么，不显示什么给了我们非常大的自主权。

下面我就来讲讲我具体是怎样使用滴答清单来处理我的日常生活的。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[越来越受欢迎的白板工具
最近几年市面上出现了很多白板工具应用，白板顾名思义就是在手机、平板、或者电脑上模拟现实生活中白板的应用。
白板应用从产品设计的角度来讲及其简单，因为白板应用的的概念模型足够简单——就是一张白纸、或者办公室放着的一块白板。
如果仅从概念模型上来看，白板应用似乎没啥可做的，你只需要写一个白板，然后做一个手写功能就可以了。
那么为什么市面上还是有那么多的白板应用呢？以及决定一款白板应用好不好用，我们是不是有什么样的评价标准呢？
对于这个问题，我想说的是，在保证使用体验的前提下，工具产品本身是没有好坏之分的，评判一款工具产品好不好其实没有意义，工具产品只能基于你的使用场景，评判适不适合。所以基于这个逻辑，我使用一个框架对市面上的白板应用进行了一个简单的分类。

 
在纵向，我根据使用场景来进行划分，就是你使用白板更多的时候是个人使用，还是需要和别人协作？
在横坐标上，我使用白板本身的功能性来进行划分，目前市面上的白板应用在功能性层面主要分为两类，第一类主打真实书写体验，无限书写区域，完全书写自由度，第二类则主打提供模块化的组件，弱化书写体验，强化沟通模版的白板应用。
从这种分类方式可以发现，其实个人的更偏向于自由度高的，而协作的更偏向于模块化的，为什么呢？
因为这和实际的工作场景是匹配的，个人使用白板，无论怎么发散书写，书写的信息的上下文都在个人脑中。但如果是协作场景的话，沟通的效率就变得至关重要，所以一些通用的，模块化的，标准化的沟通方法可以让所有对一个事情的认知都对齐，这种方法本质上是弱化了个人化的表达方式，用更标准的沟通方式来提升沟通效率。
也许以上分类方法并不是一定合理，但就目前我自己用起来是OK的。
在聊具体的白板应用之前我想，先聊一个问题。
为什么白板这么好用？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[研究发现所有的网络拥塞控制算法都可能是非常不公平的

尽管在过去大约 40 年中提出了数百种控制计算机网络“拥堵”延迟的关键算法，但没有明显的赢家。一项新的研究发现，每种拥塞控制算法都无法解决“饿死”的问题，即让一些用户占据了所有的带宽，而至少有一个人基本上得不到带宽。拥塞控制算法依靠数据包的丢失和延迟作为细节来推断拥塞，并决定发送数据的速度。然而，数据包可能因为网络拥堵以外的原因而丢失和延迟 —— 这被称之为网络“抖动”。而拥塞控制算法无法区分由拥塞和抖动造成的延迟的区别，由抖动引起的延迟是不可预测的，最终会导致出现饥饿的情况。


消息来源：Slashdot



老王点评：这就是算法的不公平，或许，限定在算法的层面上，并无一个完美的解决方案。




TikTok 否认内置浏览器记录用户输入

研究发现，流行 iOS 应用如 TikTok、Instagram、FB Messenger 和 Facebook 都支持用户在应用内打开浏览器访问第三方网站，期间会植入跟踪代码。以 TikTok 为例，它会记录用户的所有键盘输入，包括密码信用卡信息等敏感数据，以及屏幕上的每一次点击。从技术上说这相当于安装了一个键盘记录器。在这一报道发表之后，TikTok 发表声明，证实该功能存在，但 TikTok 并没有利用这些代码。TikTok 表示应用内浏览器旨在提供更好的用户体验，它植入第三方网站的 JS 代码是为了调试、排错和性能监视。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：植入这种第三方 SDK，即便是没启用，但是谁知道你什么时候会启用呢？




美国绝大部分雇主正在跟踪员工的生产力

根据《纽约时报》的调查，美国 10 个最大的私人雇主中，有 8 个正在为他们的雇员追踪生产力指标。其中一些软件测量活动时间，观察键盘停顿，甚至默默地计算击键次数。他们看到了从写电子邮件的时间到键盘活动的一切。如果员工没有达到预期的目标，就会产生影响：一个催促的通知，一个跳过的奖金，或者一个在家工作的日子被剥夺。对于在返回办公室的斗争中投降的雇主来说，这种监控是保持控制感的一种方式。


消息来源：Slashdot



老王点评：这可真是“工具人”，我觉得这和用代码行数来统计程序员的绩效具有“异曲同工之妙”。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[根据 Aiven 的一份新报告，谷歌已经提高了其对开源软件的投入，并在活跃贡献者方面超过了微软。


根据 Aiven 的报告（LCTT 译注：我没有找到这份报告），谷歌目前的活跃贡献者多于微软，这要归功于对开源代码库 GitHub 的每月提交量同比增长 20%。根据开源贡献者指数（OCSI）的数据，谷歌 7 月份有 5421 名活跃贡献者，而微软的活跃贡献者为 5268 名。

Aiven 联合创始人兼首席技术官 Heikki Nousiainen 说，谷歌超过微软“特别令人惊讶”。

“这其中的一个因素是微软对开源项目的提交逐年下降，”Nousiainen 说，“然而，微软对开发者自由和创新的投入是一致的，该公司是开源的主要参与者，甚至在 2018 年收购了 GitHub。”

Aiven 指出，亚马逊已经开始更加重视开源计划，其对 OpenSearch（ElasticSearch 的复刻）的支持以及 GitHub 上项目数量的增加就是证明。Nousiainen 认为，亚马逊对 OpenSearch 和 ElasticSearch 的支持代表了“该公司方向的重大改变”，以及对重大开源项目掌舵的愿望。据 Aiven 介绍，这些科技巨头正在迅速扩大对开源软件的使用。根据数据，现在来自亚马逊、微软和谷歌的活跃 GitHub 贡献者比六年前多了 300%。

“这项研究的总体信息是积极的，”Nousiainen 说，“在开源社区有大量的创新在继续发生，其结果使我们所有人受益。数不清的人正在为其他人树立一个榜样。”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[上周三微信派发布了《2012.8.17，微信公众平台上线了》，引发了一群公号自媒体人的集体怀旧。是啊，已经十年了。
你或多或少还能想起一些公号大V，还有以前在朋友圈刷屏的文章，那些高光时刻像浮雕一样刻在脑海，好像见证着这个平台的兴衰浮沉。
今天不考古，也不讲宏大叙事，想从个人的视角，跟你分享下我与公众号的一些故事。

我第一次知道公众号是2013年，那是大一下学期，我也刚注册微信。
彼时微博正兴，因在校园杂志上看到「糗事大百科」博主赵诚玩微博年入千万，颠覆认知，第一次看到上学-工作之外的道路。
我能不能呢？不知道，但想试试。
寒假买了第一台笔记本电脑，从此没日没夜沉浸在微博里，研究怎么涨粉、互推、发段子。
做搞笑内容半年时间，小有成就，到了5万多粉丝（没买粉），偶有广告投放赚点零花钱，我对微博的发展充满信心。
注册微信后了解到公众号，那会儿我对它是不屑一顾的，长内容、排版难看、一天就发一条、没互动，怎么看都没出路。而微博不一样，信息流、用户停留时间长、话题多、互动丰富、140字段子&新闻、搞笑动图，人们更喜欢，这才是媒介发展的下一个方向。
公众号就像上个时代的博客，现在无非迁移到移动端，换汤不换药。
谁愿意拿着手机看长文呢？
2014年，我给学校一家饰品玩具店出营销主意，老板问我要不要做公众号，我坚决说不要做，耽误精力、不能实时传达，还得引导关注，太麻烦，不如加微信好友送小礼品，然后朋友圈发优惠活动。人们不看公众号，但肯定刷朋友圈，触达率更高（没想到那会儿就有私域流量的理念了）。
转变是在大二下学期，微博起色不大，发送频率高又耽误学习，而且一直发搞笑段子觉得没意义，就把号卖了。
于此同时，公众号很多优质内容开始出现，好多大V也倾向长文、深度观点输出，即便是搞笑段子，质量也比微博高一个层次。自己开始沉迷每日阅读公号，朋友圈也经常有刷屏文章，同学讨论的也是XX文章的观点，仿佛突…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[每年，我们都会讨论 Linux 桌面年。当我们看到操作系统在消费者领域的市场份额有所增加时，却知道是无望的。




当然，Linux 主导着整个云行业（Web 托管、云计算、数据仓库等）。在这里，我们只关注桌面 Linux 的市场份额。

如果你是 Linux 世界的新手，可能不知道，Linux 不是一个操作系统，它是一个内核。但是，为了简单起见，我们倾向于将 “Linux” 称为操作系统。你可以在我们的解释文章中了解 Linux 是什么。

有朝一日，我们希望 Linux 发行版在未来的桌面操作市场份额中占据主导地位。但是，当前的趋势说明了什么？现在是 Linux 桌面年了吗？

趋势每个月都在变化。去年，与今年相比，Linux 可能市场份额更多一些。因此，跟踪最新报告至关重要。

在这里，我们试图以来自不同来源的每月更新报告的形式跟踪最新趋势。

操作系统市场份额：2022 年 7 月


我们每个月都会更新可用信息。请注意，上个月的信息将在下个月发布。因此，例如，当我们在 8 月份更新报告时，它将包括 7 月份的统计数据。


在可用的桌面操作系统（Windows、macOS 和 Chrome OS）中，Linux 通常倾向于占据第三位。

一些最新的统计数据包括：

Statista
最后更新于 2022 年 6 月
2.42%
14.64%
76.33%



另外，参与 Stack Overflow 调查 的开发者中，40.23% 的用户将基于 Linux 的操作系统用于个人用途，39.89% 的用户将其用于专业用途。

每个来源都使用不同的数据收集方法。市场份额不断变化，这就是为什么我们决定定期更新此报告，而不是单独发布关于市场份额微小变化的帖子。

总体而言，看起来 Linux 作为桌面操作系统在开发人员中很受欢迎，并最终影响游戏玩家和其他消费者作为替代操作系统。

你对这种趋势有何看法？你认为 Linux 会在桌面市场份额方面超过 macOS 吗？在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome page, and the videos walk you through the power of the data portal.

What we call the 'geo-enabled business' is a company who creates and manages data about their slice of the real world - for example, commercial real estate🏣, agriculture and farming🐖, manufacturing plants🏭, or construction projects🔨.

Companies like this are capturing more and more data every day: drone photos, mobile phone videos 📱, thermal cameras 📷, geospatial shape files, 3D and pointclouds from photogrammetry, Zoom recordings🎙about a client project, or simply Office documents and PDFs.

Via machine learning, we extract 'observations' of people 👪, places ⛺ 🌁 ⛪ and things 🚁🚊🚜 in your files - into your personal knowledge graph. From this data in the knowledge graph, you can search, filter, view, analyze on a map or over time - or send alerts to Slack, send daily email summaries, or even connect via webhook to your own APIs.

Also, you can plugin machine learning APIs to extract even more information - via computer vision, text analysis or audio transcription.  We ship with some of the leading APIs out of the box (AssemblyAI, Roboflow, Primer), but you can also bring ML models that you, your company or a partner have built.

We have tons more features coming later this year, like ESRI ArcGIS integration, photogrammetry support, more data feeds and enrichments, and publishing out to other databases and platforms.

When you signup for a free 14 day trial, you'll get 100GB of cloud storage and access to all our current features.

Try it out today at https://portal.unstruk.ai, and we look forward to hearing what you think!

Thanks,

        <updated>2022-08-22T07:01:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What it is and why

massCode is a snippet manager for developers that helps you conveniently organize pieces of code and have quick access to them. Multilevel folders and tags are used for organization, and each snippet has fragments for even more granular structuring. The app supports Markdown so it can be used as a notebook if needed. 

What's New

Direct support for TextMate grammars

Now massCode uses Codemirror as the basis for the editor and `.tmLanguage` as the grammar for syntax highlighting. This tandem opens the door to over 600 existing grammars. The application currently supports more than 160 grammars. In addition to `.tmLanguage`, the application supports `.tmTheme` for themes. 

Real-time Render for HTML & CSS

Now you can see the result of HTML & CSS directly in the application. This is such a CodePen on minimal :)

Mermaid Diagram

Added support for Mermaid - diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically.

Presentation Mode

Many developers struggle with work-life balance. They are overloaded with regular tasks and frequently called upon to solve urgent customer issues. Yet many developers, like me, have ideas they want to promote if only they had time to do so. Sometimes these pet ideas do not make it through the product management feature-selection process. Other times, a developer does not have time to complete the solution end-to-end on their own, yet they know if it could somehow be implemented, the project would benefit.
This is where mentoring comes in. Mentorship has many benefits: It helps the mentee's personal development, and it can improve the mentor's self-confidence an…]]></summary>

New on the GNOME desktop is their terminal emulator application simply named Console. It seems aimed at providing a no-nonsense, stable command-line environment for Linux users.

The GNOME Console isn't as feature-rich as a lot of other terminals, including the previous GNOME terminal, but I like it and have been using it regularly for the past few months. I enjoy the simplicity of it. I waste time in other terminal emulators configuring fonts, colors, and profiles.
Console does have some options and nice integration with the GNOME desktop. I'll start with t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[「第二份简历」
首先解释一下这个「第二份」是什么意思。我通常喜欢把在大四校招时使用的简历称作「第一份简历」，因为那是你踏入社会的第一步，是你第一次将自己的经历通过简历来展示。往后跳槽、换工作使用的简历都可以称作「第二份」，它代表着你已经是一个成熟的社会人，有足够的社会、工作经验。
那么就让我们先回看一下「第一份简历」我们都会写一些什么。我们在写校招简历的时候，通常会涉及到的内容为以下几点。

专业课分数 / 绩点
奖惩情况
兼职情况
在校期间参与的项目（可以是学校的实验，也可以是兼职参与的项目）
在校期间所任职务

这五点足够展现你在大学四年的能力，让校招企业充分了解你。因为能够参与校招的企业，都知道你不会有正式的工作经历，自然也没参与过社会上的工作项目。企业人事对参与校招的学生大多抱着「该生是否有培养空间」的态度来面对。因此在写校招简历的时候上面五点只需要充分体现你的潜力就足以吸引到大部分校招企业。
来到「第二份简历」，这个时候你面对的 HR ，不再会把你当作初出茅庐的应届毕业生，而是一个有着社会工作经验的求职者。HR 对求职者的要求也非常简单明了，即「你是否能为公司创造价值」。这个「价值」可以是短期内的，也可以是长远角度的，具体看 HR 怎么定位你的职位。但是有一点是不变的，那就是上面提到的，你不再是学生，你只是「求职者」。
如何写「第二份简历」
「第二份简历」相比「第一份简历」，会有不少内容上的变化。首先是不再着重于在校情况的描写，而是着墨于当前或者上段工作经历的一个梳理与细致归纳。不要简单概括，而是要将内容详细写出来。同时，在现公司或者前公司所做的项目，也要有个清晰的描写。
工作经历

让我们先来看看这份简历。这是少数派员工 @三点一四 的个人简历，也是现在许多求职者非常典型的一种简历。在工作经历中「工作职责」这一栏有两个条目，一个是「监督员工工作状…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近我们发布了一款全新的笔记产品——Neatfiy。（https://neatifyapp.com/）
正如其名，Neat（整洁）ify（化），Neatify 的初衷是编辑整洁清晰的结构化笔记，比起很快速的随手记备忘录，它适用于知识的管理、周期性的写作总结...之类的场景。
如左图
在大约去年年底的时候，我们立下了一个 Flag——我们要将专注笔记进行一次重构。 Neatify 就是我们拿出来的结果。下面不简单地聊一下，我们在这个路上的一些思考，以及集中回答一些朋友提出的疑问：

很多人对于 Neatify 的第一个疑问，就是为什么我们团队要出两款很相似的两款产品？

专注笔记，是我们第一款推出的笔记软件。也是我们团队首次接触「笔记」软件的开始，虽然我们自己也很喜欢专注笔记，它有很多很有用的功能及体验，比如结构化的目录、清晰的标注阅读体验。
但确实我们是第一次做笔记软件，前期很多没想清楚的地方，因此做了很多没什么用、甚至很负面的一些设计。这些是一些很沉重的历史包袱。如果我们还背着沉重的历史包袱，我们在优化的过程中就显得被束缚住了。
很显然的是，我们在这三年多的积累里，最重要的不是我们写过了什么代码，而是积累了很多很多的经验。所以我们这次，希望是抛开一切已有的东西，去构思一款自己心目中最理想的笔记产品应该是怎样的。这就是 Neatify。
在 Neatfiy 上面，我们并没有很刻意地去增加很多的功能，来让它看上去有很明显被“改版升级”的感觉，甚至做了很多的减法，比如：
1、把笔记本、子页面等层级都砍了，只保留文件夹 → 页面这样的结构，因为在使用专注笔记的时候，我们总在纠结，这样的层级关系，我们应该使用笔记本呢？还是子页面呢？还是文件夹呢？它们之间的作用太相似了，在每次使用的时候都要思考很久，这是意见很“反效率”的事情。
2、把很多花里胡哨的功能去了，比如各种各样的视图啊之类…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why is digital citizenship important to teach? Some stats from the USA:
- 93% of young people aged 8-18 owned a smartphone in 2021
- 37% of young people between the ages of 12 and 17 have been cyberbullied
- Teens who spend 5 or more hours online a day are 71% more likely than those who spend only 1 hour a day to have at least one suicide risk factor 
- 89% of sexual advances directed at young people occur through instant messaging & chatroom
- 80% of middle schoolers believed that an advertisement labeled as sponsored content was actually a news story
- 60% of educational organizations experienced phishing attacks in 2020 
- Ransomware attacks on US schools and colleges cost $3.5 billion in 2021 

Through research and discussions with K-12 school districts, we learned that digital citizenship is a priority, but districts lack the tools to deliver up-to-date content at scale and measure results. Teachers also have very limited amounts of time to effectively incorporate digital citizenship lessons into their curriculum. We also learned that students are becoming accustomed to learning through short form video content. 

Why UpSavvy works:
- Takes students less than 5 minutes a month to learn digital citizenship.
- Interactive content with over 200 bite size videos, quizzes & simulations.
- Empowers teachers with resources while minimizing their time investment.
- Enhances the classroom experience without sacrificing learning time.
- Integrates directly with school district rostering & LMS systems including Clever, Classlink, Google & Microsoft
- Curriculum covers topics: Privacy & Security, Digital Well-Being, Cyberbullying, Digital Footprint, Media Literacy, Technology Essentials, Online Relationships & Safety, Digital Commerce, Digital Finance

As parents and technology experts, our mission is to help K-12 students make better decisions online. Try some free lessons by signing up on our website, we appreciate your feedback.

USB “橡皮鸭子”看起来就像一个普通的 U 盘。但把它插入电脑，机器就会把它看作是一个 USB 键盘。最初的 USB “橡皮鸭子”在 10 多年前发布，成为黑客们的最爱，如创建一个假的 Windows 弹出框来获取用户的登录凭证，或使 Chrome 浏览器将所有保存的密码发送到攻击者的服务器。这些年来它也在不断更新。新的 DuckyScript 3.0 允许用户编写函数、存储变量和使用逻辑流控制，成为了一种功能丰富的语言。它还可以将数据编码为二进制格式，并通过键盘的大写锁定或数字锁定灯的闪烁作为信号，来窃取目标机器的数据。用这种方法，攻击者可以把它插上几秒钟，告诉别人："对不起，我想那个 U 盘坏了"，然后把它拿回来，并保存他们所有的密码。

Copilot 将使计算机教育的编程练习变得毫无意义

有计算机教授担心 Copilot 将使传统的计算机教育的编程练习变得毫无意义，因为 Copilot 知道所有的答案。“据我所知，Copilot 在所有的入门编程作业上都接受过专门培训，Copilot 该死的喜欢编程入门作业。”虽然很多计算机编程练习可以在网上找到代码的例子，但老师也可以在谷歌上找到它们，然后用抄袭检测器将这些代码与提交的代码进行比较。而 Copilot 是不同的，它实际上产生了新颖的解决方案，在表面上有足够的不同，以至于它们看起来可能来自学生们自己写的。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：确实，这就如同使用计算器来学习初等数学，并不能真的让人学会数学。所以，计算机教育需要为 Copilot 这类 AI 工具的到来做一些准备。除了限制对 Copilot 的访问，是否还可以做更多的事情？




新的后量子密码学算法将于 2024 成为标准

上个月，由恩智浦、IBM 和 Arm 的安全专家共同编写的专门安全算法被美国 NIST 选中，成为旨在应对量子威胁的行业全球标准的一部分。NIST 宣布了这些后量子密码学算法将在 2024 年成为标准。而目前通行的 RSA 和 ECC 等密码学算法用了十多年才确定了最佳标准。


消息来源：IoT Times



老王点评：先不说两年时间能不能准备好，我认为现在的抗量子加密学算法还未经受过考验，仓促之下怕是用处有限。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[上一讲“猛药”过去，功效性的讲解就要小小告一段落了。在护肤金字塔的第二层，只剩下了“修护”这个话题，而在金字塔的顶端，“再生”我们还有没有提到。修护与再生，代表了皮肤自身的规律，修护受损的细胞，代谢老去的废物，同时刺激新的牺牲生成。修护和再生在一门交叉学科，很难把他们分开。那么就从这里开始，让我们看看修护和再生的秘诀。
什么是修护与再生
我们的皮肤，每天都冲在第一线，帮助我们抵御外界的侵袭，所以皮肤每天都在“受伤”，修护，就是要让我们的皮肤屏障更坚挺，保证皮肤能够处于正常的工作状态。
但修护并不等同于“包扎伤口”，不是只有当皮肤已经明显受损以后才需要修护，而更像是增强免疫力，需要从日常下手，维护皮肤的健康状态。所以，修护既是我们大妈们锻炼身体的广场舞，也是医生关键时刻可以救命的手术刀。
而再生，依赖于修护，又高于修护。修护的目的就是让皮肤获得健康稳定的状态，从而促使其再生，再生依赖于修护提供好的基础，同时又在修护的基础上提供和创造新生。
修护与再生的场景
不同的情况下，我们所选择的修护方法、成分、产品也不尽相同。
日常修护
大多数时候，我们需要的都只是日常的修护，目的是让白天工作了一天的皮肤得到舒缓和放松，类似于我们每晚的睡眠，是为了让皮肤可以继续保持一个健康稳定的状态。这种情况下，并不需要使用什么猛药，只需要选择皮肤容易吸收的，温和的产品，就可以达到我们的要求。这时修护的关键词是：温和。
晒后紧急修护
紫外线对皮肤的伤害，在防晒的一讲中已经充分解读（忘记了，可以回看这里），但有时候我们难免遇到极端天气，或者一时犯懒，防晒做的不好，导致皮肤被晒伤。这时皮肤往往处于一个非常脆弱的状态，继续急速有效的镇定，来帮助皮肤迅速回到相对稳定的状态。这时修护的关键词是：极速。
过敏修护
对于敏感肌同学，经常需要面对的就是解决自己的过敏问题，当皮肤受到一些并不耐受的刺激，就会激发皮肤的自我…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[做一个高效的、充满好奇心的问题解决者吧！这会帮助你成为一名成功的程序员。


你是否曾经遇到过这样一种情况：你想解决一个问题，并且你在 YouTube 或 Google 中找到了相关的教程。嗯，你觉得看会了，可真做起来，却止步不前，大脑一片空白。你感觉自己每一行代码都看懂了，可一旦离开了那个教程，就步履维艰。如果你在 HackerRank 或 LeetCode 上看过别人的解题过程，你就能体会到，一个有追求的程序员第一次看到这些挑战时，他会是何种感受。举例来说，假设你正在学习一门新语言，在你刚开始理解这门语言的基础知识的时候，你看了一个教程，摩拳擦掌，结果发现自己无法独立应用学到的知识，这反过来可能会导致你怀疑自己的知识和能力。

把教程付诸于实践

你应该从头开始吗？如果你这么做，你可能很快就会发现自己重复学习了很多次相同的知识点。虽然从头开始并不一定是种浪费，但是，你该如何变得更高效呢？

死记硬背在编程中完全是行不通的。话虽如此，但你也不能够忽视熟悉语法的重要性。因为，死记硬背和养成习惯之间是有明显区别的。习惯是很难打破的。要养成多使用编程语言的常规语法、函数、方法、模式、范式和构造的习惯，这样你才能掌握它。掌握一门编程语言需要大量的创造力和练习。练习语法是非常必要的，直到它们能在你的脑海中自然地浮现，就像血液在血管里流动一样。

“问题解决”的工作原理

那么，你该采取什么样的方案呢？这实际上取决于许多因素。这些因素可以是任何东西，下至技术限制，上至用户需要。世界上有无数的问题，每个问题都有许多解决方式。如何选择一个最好的？这就需要“问题解决”problem-solving的技巧了。

下面是一个简单的例子。你需要把两个数相加，让它们等于 6。显然，你有多种方式可供选择：

3 + 3 = 6 或 4 + 2 = 6 或 5 + 1 = 6

同理，如果你需要让两个数字，经过一次减法、乘法或除法运算后，得到的结果为 6。你仍然有很多选项，包括：

8 - 2 = 6 或 12 / 2 = 6 或 3 * 2 = 6

每种方案都有它固有的限制，且各不相同。当你在现实生活中尝试做出一个高效的方案时，你必须要考虑到所有的限制。这个方案可行吗？有什么障碍吗？有可操作性吗？是否可扩展呢？而如何最小化约束，并做出一个最优方案，就取决于问题类型和业务需要。

练习很重要

编程的目标不仅仅是解决问题。因此，从工程视角理解代码如何工作始终是一个优势。这就是代码审查在企业级开发中发挥作用的地方。编程的最低要求是具备基本的编码知识，包括语言的语法、函数和方法。归根结底，“写代码”是需要你去写的，所以练习总是有助于提高你的技能。流畅的写作和复杂方案的开发都来自于持续的学习和训练。

学习编码

我撰写和分享这篇文章，是为了鼓励新程序员去探寻自己的内心，寻找那个“优秀的问题解决者”。请不要停止相信自己。

要成功编码，你需要培养许多习惯。下面是我在学习编码时保持高效的方法：


一个包含语法、方法和函数 速查手册 总能应付不时之需。

将问题分解成更小的部分，便于追踪。

尝试理解代码运行的核心概念。

构思解决方案时，大可发挥你的创造力 —— 但刚开始还是要注重基础。

在练习时，创建尽可能多的应用和组件。

永远不要从 Stack Overflow/Exchange 等开放平台上复制/粘贴代码，特别是在不了解上下文的情况下。

跟着教程做了一遍后，尝试从头开始构建所有内容。即使你只能独立完成一半，那也仍然是一个成就。


祝我们所有人好运！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[有几十个基于 Ubuntu 的发行版可用。从 面向初学者的发行版 到 漂亮的发行版，Ubuntu 主导着 Linux 桌面空间。

如果通用发行版还不够的话，你还会发现一些 奇怪的基于 Ubuntu 的发行版。

我不打算参与 Ubuntu 与 Fedora 的辩论。我只是说如果你想在 Fedora 领域中尝试一些东西，我可以列出一些选项。

请记住，我不会列出面向服务器的 Linux 发行版。此处的列表适用于 桌面 Linux 用户。

该列表没有特定的排名顺序，并且提到的选项可能并不总是适合新用户。因此，在第一次安装任何基于 Fedora 的发行版之前，请确保你浏览了文档。

1、Fedora 定制版



Fedora 有很多定制版spin，但没有 Ubuntu 那么多。

Fedora 定制版 不是基于 Fedora 的独立发行版，而只是具有 不同桌面环境 或采用平铺窗口管理器的不同版本的 Fedora。

如果你不喜欢默认的 GNOME 桌面环境，你可以下载其中一种。

一些可用的选项是：


Fedora KDE Plasma

Fedora i3 平铺窗口管理器

Fedora LXQt

Fedora LXDE

Fedora MATE-COMPIZ

Fedora Cinnamon 版


2、Nobara



当你在找 游戏发行版 时，列表将由 Debian 和 Arch 衍生产品占据主导地位。因此，如果你正在寻找基于 Fedora 且具有相同效果的游戏发行版，那么 Nobara 就是你所需要的。

Nobara 是由 Proton GE 的维护者制作的游戏发行版，他也是 Lutris 开发团队的成员，因此你可以期待开箱即用的下一代游戏体验！

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。 

进度条是个好东西，在日常的工作生活中，总会有一些场景是它能大展身手的。
做项目管理时，我们能通过一个里程碑的进度条，了解其下多个任务的整体进度；做预算管理时，设置好每个类别的预算上限，进度条就能告诉我们各个类别下的预算使用情况；测评打分时，进度条也能直观展示各评分项之下，打分对象的得分情况（比如餐厅的口味、环境、服务），方便我们对比绝对值、相对值。
如果你是一名 Notion 的资深用户，可能已经早早的在 Notion 数据库中用上了进度条，但你可能不知道，Notion 最近的一项更新，让进度条对 Notion 新手变得更低门槛、触手可及了。
在这篇 Notion 进度条教程中，我将围绕此次更新的进度条功能，介绍这 4 点内容：

Notion 新推出的进度条功能
相比原有方案，新的进度条好在哪
哪些地方可以使用新进度条
如何设置进度条

希望通过这篇文章，能帮助你更好的使用 Notion、释放自己的生产力。
原生支持的新进度条
大约 4 天前，Notion 官方发布了一条推文，宣布为进度条增加了原生支持。

从原推文的动图中可见，在 Notion 的数据库中，可以根据给定的属性值生成进度条图形，并紧邻数字显示，目前有条形（Bar）、环形（Ring）这两种可选样式：
Notion 官推里，用动图演示了进度条的设置操作
我也在自己的数据库中尝试了这两种样式，数字阅读起来确实会更直观一些。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
理性聊车，高尔夫也很好，特斯拉也很棒，奔驰宝马大家都喜欢，在此分享一下购车的一些想法和感受，祝大家都拥有自己的爱车。
我自认从工作以来和车的缘分还是非常深的，从 4S 销售到广告策划，又因为接触大众、斯柯达更多，再到家里换了奥迪后，与其说是喜欢，不如说是对这种德系品牌的习惯。结合到家里本身有车，我的车就不需要承担「家庭重任」，可以随我喜欢。但提车后的这一个多月，这台小车让我开始强烈的感受到「家的责任」。
提车日
购车在上海上半年疫情解封之后，去到奥迪4S店，看到店里积压了较多库存，当时我自己也没有特别倾向的颜色，A3的颜色除了红色我都挺喜欢，就在库存的冰川白、探戈红、环焦蓝、纳瓦拉蓝中，选择了较深的纳瓦拉蓝，张扬的造型配一个低调内敛的颜色。中配（时尚运动）的车型上，库存车上额外增加了四门无钥匙进入（+¥2000），加上购置税减半政策，实际落地20万不到。

奢侈与吝啬的交织
20万买 A0 小车，奢侈
最开始的选车首先当然是预算，20万以内，另外优先紧凑级，SUV 或 Sedan 我并不是特别在意，但两厢车型是我比较青睐的。第八代高尔夫和 A3 Sportsback 是最后的二选一，同样的预算高尔夫可以买到顶配 R-Line 版本，拥有更多的科技配置。而 A3 在20万内，只能说配置相对实用一些，没有氛围灯、副驾驶电动座椅等等这些。
网上说的最多的，就是 A3 不过是换壳高尔夫，还要加钱。说对也对，但在做工和实际的细微体验上，还是会有所差异。其实最后更促成下单的，是展厅销售的态度，毕业那年我自己也做过汽车销售，了解一些展厅里的道道。你如果问我，是不是有虚荣心的成本，那我的答案是肯定的。

不加2万上顶配，吝啬
从升级配置来看，时尚运动与豪华运动之间，相差近2万，增加了：

30色内饰氛围灯
电动折叠后视镜，带副驾驶侧下翻
副驾驶电动座椅与多向调节
三温区空调
主驾驶1…]]></summary>

本文参与数字文具盒征文活动。

背景
自高中起，就有将自己的错题整理到云端的想法，可以随时随地通过手机查看，便于复习。但是限制于当时的环境，不能方便使用数字工具，此想法便不了了之。不过「笔记数字化」的念头自此萌芽。
上了大学以后，接触到了 OneNote。将有价值的「文章」、上课的笔记、PPT「搬运」到OneNote 上，像一只勤劳的小仓鼠，不断囤积「知识」。看着软件日渐增长的「占用大小」，充满了成就感。但是工作之后，慢慢发现积累的这些「知识」无法应用到生产实践当中，很多笔记可能自「搬运」进 OneNote 之后便再也没有打开过。
偶然的一次机会，听到了 flomo 创始人少楠老师关于「知识管理」的讲座 ，其中提到我再熟悉不过的一句话：

搬运是一种浪费。

作为一位工业工程专业的毕业生，「搬运浪费」作为「八大浪费」之一是学习的重点，也是工作的切入点。但是我之前只将其应用于工作的生产过程，却忽略了自己的「知识加工」过程。我突然意识到，在我原本的知识管理流程中，「搬运」占据了很大一部分，而忽略了这是极大的浪费。这种搬运不产生任何附加值，也不会加深知识在自己大脑中的印象，也就不可能在以后需要的时候轻易调用。除了浪费时间和精力，顺便满足了自己内心小小的成就感和虚荣心之外，几乎没有益处。因为从生产的角度讲，「搬运」的知识只是从工厂门口搬运到了加工车间，堆放在角落里，几乎不可能搬上生产设备，更不可能成为有价值的「产品」。
在少楠老师的推荐下，我开始接触 《卡片笔记写作法》 一书，尝试使用双链笔记工具重新打造我的「知识加工厂」。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[韦伯太空望远镜大量使用了 20 年前的一种 JavaScript 方言

根据韦伯太空望远镜的综合科学仪器模块手册，它有一堆预先写好的 JavaScript 脚本来完成特定的任务，地面上的科学家可以告诉它运行这些任务。当然，这些脚本不是运行在一个浏览器里面，而是用一个叫做“脚本处理器”的程序解释，然后它将根据脚本的要求，与其他的应用程序和系统联系。这些脚本所使用的语言是一种 JavaScript 版本 Nombas ScriptEase 5.00e，但开发它的公司已不存在，这种语言最后的版本发布于 2003 年。虽然韦伯太空望远镜是在 2021 年底发射的，但这个项目从上世纪八十年代就开始了，而建设在 2004 年开始时的。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：居然选择了这么古老而不严谨的脚本，这十年间就难道没有一点点改进的想法吗？




VFX 参考平台建议动画行业升级到 RHEL 9

VFX 参考平台旨在帮助规范数字内容创作领域的软件平台，以发布年度软件建议清单而闻名，如每个操作系统上的编译器版本，特定年份的 Qt/Python/Numpy 组件，以及基于行业反馈和与各种内容创作者和工作室互动的各种其他软件版本。他们发布了一份报告，供视觉效果和动画工作室在选择下一个 Linux 平台时考虑。他们发现很多工作室仍然依赖 CentOS 7，他们建议这些工作室不迟于 2024 年转移到新的操作系统，首选是红帽的 RHEL 9，或者 Rocky Linux、AlmaLinux 等下游分支。他们也建议可以考虑 Ubuntu Linux。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：即便不想付费购买 RHEL 9，Rocky Linux 等也可以考虑。其实，根据我的研究， CentOS Stream 也是可以的。




Meta 用算法“随机”解雇 60 名劳务派遣人员

此前 Meta 与埃森哲签订了近 5 亿美元的合同，由隶属于后者的劳务派遣人员到 Meta 位于奥斯汀的办公室工作，主要开展内容审核和商业诚信等业务。Meta 通过视频电话会议告知被裁的员工，除了明确是“随机”选择之外，没有给出裁员的具体原因。去年 8 月份，游戏行业支付处理公司 Xsolla 也使用算法裁掉了 150 名员工。


消息来源：纽约邮报



老王点评：很多底层员工，在他们看起来，其实就是一个数字，可以掷骰子决定。]]></summary>

九月将至，大一新生踏入校园的同时，大四「老油条」们也开始准备自己的毕业论文与实习工作。学年论文与毕业论文时本科生绕不过的一座大山，以下是我在大四撰写论文时积累的一些个人经验与见解，希望对学弟、学妹们的论文写作有所帮助。
电子资源
文科专业的大部分学生在本科阶段，了解学界研究会借助知网、万方数据等文献数据库。国内高校图书馆也会购买文献数据库的使用权限，方便校内教职工与学生使用。在校园网中打开图书馆的网站，找到电子资源栏目，便可以看到学校已购买的电子数据库。除了学校提供的电子资源，不少地方图书馆对当地公众与读者提供电子资源，如国家图书馆、浙江图书馆在注册后便可免费使用。

扩展阅读：《免费看论文？除了学校的图书馆，还有 ……》

当我们搜索某个领域的文献，数据库会返回不少的文章，文章的质量良莠不齐，参考文献的作用时帮助你了解研究话题的学术现状、存在问题、解决方法等，导师进行论文指导也会强调尽量挑选时间较新的「核心期刊」与「原始文献」，注重文献的权威性、专业性与时效性。在数据库搜索时，我们可以通过筛选功能，选择来自「核心期刊」的文献，如北大核心、南大核心、SCI、EI、SSCI 等期刊目录。
期刊筛选
大部分阅读与参考的文献我是从万方数据下载的，PDF 文档方便在不同的软件中阅读与文献管理，二是万方提供的 PDF 文档默认自带目录与文字图层，知网（大陆版）默认只提供 CAJ 格式的文档，缺德到家。
Word 主题样式
不少大学生在「制造学术垃圾」使用的主流写作工具是 Microsoft Word，最头疼的除了正文写作，还有学术论文的格式规范。一篇学术论文的结构大致可分为以下四大部分：封面、目录、正文以及引用。
论文结构
以我大学的《毕业论文档案打印和格式要求》为例，除去页面设置、撰写规范、字词符号用法等要求，大部分内容的格式涉及到 Word 中的字…]]></summary>

As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words, and while that's not always the case with terminal commands and code, it still holds true for the graphical desktop. Screenshots capture precisely what's on your screen. I love taking them to have a record of who attends meetings, so I don't have to write it down at the moment. Or to capture a bug when doing UI testing. We all take them for different reasons, though, and there are more ways to take a screenshot than you might at first think.
I started thinking about screenshots after Jim Hall wrote an article listing GNOME screenshots, GIMP, and Firefox as the ways he often takes screenshots. And yet t…]]></summary>

Recently, I published my first book, The Kubernetes Operator Framework Book from Packt Publishing. Writing a book has always been a personal goal of mine, and so it seems fitting that I was able to check that off by writing about one of my favorite topics: Kubernetes.
My journey with Kubernetes began in 2016, as a software engineer for Red Hat OpenShift. There, I had the opportunity to work with (and learn from) some of the smartest folks in the open source community. I learned first-hand some of the best practices for Kubernetes development as they were applied to broad enterprise use cases. And as I watched the development of OpenShift 4 take shape, I got to witness the functionalit…]]></summary>

Notes are part of any writer's life. Most of my articles begin in a note-taking application and that’s usually Joplin for me. There are a large number of note-taking apps for Linux and you may use something other than my favorite. A recent blog article reminded me of a half dozen of them, so I assembled a list of my favorites.

Joplin is available on Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. I like Joplin because it automatically saves whatever you add to it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[为了给新人创作者提供制作播客的参考，此前播客志对录音场地、录音设备、后期工具、AU使用教程进行了大规模征集及分享，邀请故事FM、日谈公园、深夜谈谈等播客机构，Steve、重轻、艾文和金花等资深创作者进行分享。
本次推送延续此前的逻辑，在有了场地、设备等硬件设施后，分享一档节目如何诞生。也可以说是内容创作的SOP（标准流程），邀请声东击西、日谈公园、津津乐道、深夜谈谈、番薯剥壳工作室，讲述专业播客机构的内容生产流程，如何保证节目质量始终保持一定水准？如何协调不同工种间的工作？一期节目上线前要经历什么？
每期精品内容的产出都是在推动播客朝着行业化的方向发展，感谢各大机构工作人员的热情参与！

声动活泼
 

审核和内容收集
(虽然是具体情况具体分析，但是对于部分节目可以固定下来)
 
1、资料完善度
主持人需要详细的提纲，这对后面流程完善起到重要作用
主持人需要提交的是:嘉宾资料(姓名正确书写、头衔、照片、希望给到的社交媒体账号)+**建议标题**+采访内容&提纲+音频收集+建议删除内容
 
2、素材给到时间(1.5 小时，2 人对话)
负责人:主播+监制
素材一般提前7天，至少不晚于3/4日给到
 
3 播客完成版提交审核的时间
负责人:后期
后期的制作的重点永远是:时间节点，如果只给到2天时间制作，请用好这两天时间，没必要永远优化细化无止境的美化下去。
理想的完成版审核日期，是上线前1日以上，如果无法在1日之前提交，请提前在群中说明原因
 
此外:剪辑之前请提前和节目负责人(主播/监制)确认:是否需要给嘉宾审核，考虑到嘉宾时差(如北美时间)、工作繁忙(大公司CEO)，可能需要跨自然日审核，所以最好上线前至少两天给到嘉宾粗剪版用来审核.
 
比如周二上线商业Y酱，周一需要提交音频审核，如果周一无法提交审核，需要周五说明情况
 
 
剪辑时需要注意的细节

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[由于上学和工作的关系，最近十多年我一直住在机场附近。机场内会有比其他地方更加专业的气象观测设备，而且能做到实时更新。借助这个优势我养成了看气象报文、雷达拼图和Prog Charts来判断天气的习惯。当然了，我做着一份靠天吃饭的工作，肯定是比别人更关心天气。那今天跟大家聊一聊我在平时是怎么看天气的~
一般情况
系统自带的天气app永远是最方便易用的，开机即用功能简单。在把天气信息截图分享，一目了然。我就偶尔问Siri或者Google Assistant明天天气怎么样，享受一下有助手的高级感。
看本场天气
我一般住在机场附近，所以看机场的气象报文基本等于在看自己家的天气。METAR1报看实时天气，TAF2报看未来24小时。可以看到刮什么样的风，下什么样的雨，能见度适不适合出门拍照，几点到几点不能上天台晒被子，有+TSRA了去远程哄一哄被打雷吓到的妹子，等等这些。

在 Android 平台上使用的是 Avia Weather ，简洁而且免费，只看天气很够用。付费之后可以解锁Groups功能，可以把一些机场分类。
 
在iOS上用的是AeroWeather Pro，最主要的是它有好用的Widget，还可以添加到Shortcuts。订阅后可以解锁所有飞行中能见到的气象图表。
 
报文里乱七八糟的字母和数字看不懂没关系，有兴趣的童鞋推荐给你们两份指南，一份是FAA的，一份是USAF的 。
看未来天气
    
MyRadar和Windy的功能类似，可以选择查看的信息极其丰富，好多航校甚至是航空公司也会用他们的数据。想要看懂这些图？不如来这里学习一下：aviationweather.gov/help 。下面是看图经验：

被高气压控制，通常都是好天气，反之亦然
有黄色或者西红柿炒鸡蛋颜色的地方一定有雷雨
预判雷雨的移动方向和速度
准静止锋类似暖锋，有持续不断的阴雨连绵
孤立的雷暴单体，下雨也就是一阵儿
冬天爬山，可以在零度等温线附近打卡留念
等压线密集的地方，有大风！
预测你的航班会不会因为天气原因延误
朋友坐飞机，告诉ta在起飞后的多久会遇到明显颠簸
看到哪里有火山喷发，搜一下那里附近的人上传的视频

除此之外，还能在Flightradar24上查看到气象信息，搭配飞机的飞行轨迹，看雷雨绕飞更加直观。不过实时的飞行轨迹和滞后的气象雷达图之间会有错位，有时候感觉莫名其妙。雷雨天气去机场接朋友，可以精准地选择出发时间，能在家多待会儿就多待会儿。
  
 
如果订阅了ForeFlight，再去坐飞机，会让飞行体验有质的飞跃~
 
我想大多数人都不会为了简单看个天气去搞这么复杂，不仅要记住奇奇怪怪的符号还要在app之间换来换去。只是因为我的工作离不开这些，顺便就带到了生活中，用起来还很顺手，就一直这样了。
我印象中分钟级降水预报是前几年彩云天气最早做出来的，我也有一个同样分钟级预报的故事：有一天我恰好在AOC大厅的气象雷达屏幕前，我想能不能人肉播报一次天气预报啊，于是就给我远在老家的老妈打了电话。问她家里是不是阴天啦，有没有下雨啊，她说阴天了没下雨。我说过一会儿就下啦。电话里聊了大概十分钟之后，诶，雨就来了。
哦对了，如果你女朋友说，晚上吃完饭我们去海边散散步吹吹海风吧。你一定要纠正她，晚上在海边儿吹的是陆风，不是海风，要不然叫海陆风也行。总之，天气这件事儿一定要弄清楚。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“我年纪轻轻工资就达到了 3200 一个月”。
 作为一个抖音受害者，我时常反思，有没有办法像刷抖音一样地学习？
 于是我拿出了 RSS 这个远古信息管理神器。 
上一篇文章，我们解决了「RSS 订阅源」的问题，本期内容我们就来解决 RSS 的第二大难题：RSS 阅读器。
一、RSS 阅读器
RSS 阅读器的选择，可以说五花八门。 
但总体上可以分为两种：一种是本地阅读器，一种是在线阅读器。
1、本地 RSS 阅读器
浏览器早期自带就有 RSS 阅读功能。 
但自从 2018 年 Firefox 也宣布取消 RSS 功能后，RSS 就彻底与浏览器分家。 
如今想要用 RSS，那么就要用浏览器扩展，又或者是客户端软件，现在常用的本地 RSS 阅读器有： 

本地 RSS 阅读器的特点，是操作感强，自定义功能多。 
但同时，本地 RSS 阅读器需要用自身网络来抓取更新，所以如果你不开启的话，那么就不会有新内容。
2、在线 RSS 阅读器
而在线 RSS 阅读器的特点，则是支持自动更新，还有跨平台同步。 
而且，一般还会有全文搜索、内容过滤、第三方服务集成等高级功能，现在常用的在线 RSS 阅读器有： 

但在线 RSS 阅读器的缺点也很明显。
 首先，免费帐户往往都会有订阅源数量、刷新时间的限制，并且还会有广告。 
所以综合而言，RSS 阅读器更好的选择是：使用本地 RSS 客户端来浏览在线 RSS 帐户。
3、Windows / 安卓方案
在 Windows 平台，我的选择是 Fluent Reader + Inoreader 内地版。 
Fluent Reader 是一款开源免费的 RSS 阅读器，界面简洁好看，而且是目前唯一全平台支持的 RSS 阅读器。 

Inoreader 的内地版（地址里比原来多一个 n），
是目前大陆地区，为数不多还能用的在线 RSS 阅读器。 …]]></summary>

2020 年 7 月 29 日，我来到了北京，开始了自己的北漂生活。工作之后发现时间过得很快，转眼已经北漂两年了。在北京短短的两年里，留下了很多珍贵的回忆。北漂一年整的时候就有写篇回忆录的想法，但迟迟没有动笔，如今已经开启了北漂的第三年，感觉是时候开始提笔写这篇回忆录了。
前段时间在中国好邻居家里吃了顿饭，听阮哥说起「到底什么是北漂」。我觉得每个人对「北漂」的定义都是不一样的。我理解的「北漂」，暂时先卖个关子。
在北京
当初自己本科毕业的时候首选的是在北京、上海、深圳三座城市找工作。大学因为没在一线城市读，时常懊悔和一线城市比，资源还是匮乏，所以工作说什么也要去一线城市感受一下。后来因为上海离家太近首先就排除了上海，加上一直没去过北方，就直接考虑了去北京工作。
当初考虑北京的因素其实有两个，一是北京的互联网氛围我了解到的是比上海、深圳要好的，比如很多互联网公司当时都是在北京成立的，二是我很喜欢音乐，作为全国摇滚的发源地，氛围这方面北京是当之无愧的全国第一。
其实在北京最大的一个感受就是舒服。曾经听网上有人用一个字来形容北京，那就是「土」。在北京生活了两年，倒也确实慢慢理解了北京的「土」。比如胡同的起名，比如北京人的打扮没有那么精致，比如 CBD 旁边可能就是普通居民楼。
胡同
很喜欢北京的一点就是有逛不完的胡同。虽然随着城市规划，胡同已经少了很多，但我两年里仍然没有把每一条胡同都走一遍。而且北京的胡同绕到完全能让人迷路，从这条胡同穿到那条胡同的感觉太奇妙了。
前段时间参加了朋友拍的《胡同日记·春》纪录片线下放映活动，衔接去年冬天拍的《胡同日记·冬》。在她的镜头下，我感受到了北京胡同里发生的美好。如果有机会，还是挺想搬去胡同住一段时间的。
最喜欢的就是鼓楼那一片的胡同，咖啡店和小清吧很多。不管是白天在胡同里找家咖啡店坐下来喝一杯，还是晚上和朋友吃完饭，穿梭在胡同里，…]]></summary>

At this year's DrupalCon North America, EPAM Solution Architect John Picozzi presented a talk about the importance of non-code contribution. He talked about how everyone can get involved and why he believes this is an important topic. This article is a text adaptation of John's talk; find a link below to a video recording of the complete presentation at DrupalCon.
What is non-code contribution? I asked Google this question and got the following answer: "Any contribution that helps an open source project that does not involve writing code." Thanks, Google, but I already figured that out. If you asked me to dig deeper, I'd say it's about providing your time, skills…]]></summary>

写在前面
现在的我已经不再是一个学生，甚至也不再做研究。不过，写毕业论文的时候采用的工具和方法，确实一直沿用至今，已经为工作而进行了些许改良。在读硕士研究生的三年生活中（其实第三年已经在工作岗位上度过），我曾经尝试过不少与研究或者论文写作相关的数字工具；这些工具中有些帮助我在阅读文献的过程中准确把握文章意思，从而确定了个人选题；有些则在实验进展过程中帮助我看清数据之间的关系；还有些则是论文写作的时候帮了我大忙… 不过，这三年的研究生历程也让我越来越意识到，工具与效率之间并非强烈相关：或许有的时候工具的使用反而让人南辕北辙，采用更加精简的工具，以及加入更多个人的思考，才是完成研究工作的重点。
这篇文章仅仅是想要介绍自己在论文写作的过程中用到的一些工具与方法。我研究的科目是汉语作为第二语言习得。研究生期间除了研究本身，还需要承担一些教学工作，以及一些学生管理的工作，这篇文章也会有所涉猎。
Notion：是知识库，也是数据库，还是静态网页
Notion 的多面性与灵活性，我想少数派上的众多文章已经解释得清楚明白。但至于具体如何使用，这就看个人的情况了。在我个人的例子中，主要使用了 Notion 以下几个方面的特性：

数据库功能 - 用于学生信息管理、进度追踪、组会笔记
反向链接功能 - 用于阅读文献和笔记重点内容
静态网页分享功能 - 用于呈现课程大纲、更新课程材料

Notion 的数据库功能，由于数据库中每一条都可以单独作为一个页面，每一个页面上又可以创建新的数据库…… 如此嵌套之后，形成了十分灵活的数据库体系。无论是用于学生信息的管理、进度追踪还是系列笔记，都可以在短时间内搭建起较为整洁美观的数据表格。
Notion X 学生管理
研究生期间一大工作是助教工作，需要管理一个二三十人的留学生班级。在学期初，我从教务老师那里拿到学生名单之…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[痛点
之前我跟你聊过很多次用卡片笔记法写文章的事儿。今天咱们换个话题，聊聊用卡片法做视频。
现在是移动互联网时代，学习和工作中需要用到视频制作的地方，还真不少。尤其是像我这样当老师的。

我这几年做了许多视频。但是实话实说，凡是复杂一些的视频，特别是技术类讲解展示，我在制作的时候总会感觉很焦虑。
焦虑的原因，是表达欲和成熟度不匹配。
我最想表达的时刻，往往是刚让电脑跑出来一个结果。这时候，我特别想把自己的成果和喜悦心情分享出去。
但是，一般这时候内容成熟度是不够的。例如前面的铺垫内容，还都没有准备好。讲解的思路，也都没有理顺。
怎么办呢？
常见做法，自然就是去查找和准备这些资料，直到胸有成竹。这样自己讲解内容时，才不会露怯。
可等到内容成熟度足够了，时间往往已经过去许久，我也没有那么想展示自己做出来的结果了，因为兴奋感衰退了。
很多有趣的内容，因此淹没在了我的笔记里。更可惜的，是那些没有记录下来的内容，就丢弃在风中了。可惜。
最近，我开始尝试用 Stable Diffusion 来人工智能绘图。这款工具真是非常强大。绘制出来的内容，比起 Disco Diffusion ，要精细得多。说明一下，我不是画家，上面描述的，是本人尝试对比后的主观感受。请不要跟我讨论某些风格上「Disco Diffusion 甩开 Stable Diffusion 几条街」之类的。不听不听。
举个例子，我最近开始读《九宫格写作法》这本书。里面有一段描述顾客尝试过一碗汤后的评论：

汤底是炖了 3 天的猪骨浓汤，配菜是汆烫得恰到好处的豆芽菜，吃起来脆嫩爽口。桌子上放有店家推荐的柚子胡椒，只需撒上一点点，柚子那清新的酸味便会让你眼前一亮。

我于是好奇心大起，就想尝试一下，这碗汤画出来是什么样子。于是我决定用 Stable Diffusion 来画。
首先还得把上面那段话翻译成英文，因为 Stable …]]></summary>

When it comes to time synchronization for embedded systems in a distributed architecture, there are "soft" use cases (typical, everyday devices) and complex, or "hard," use cases (car brake systems, aerospace). It's easy to see that a hard use case has unique requirements and a low tolerance for latency. To put it another way, hard use cases have hard, real-time constraints.
Latency is the bitter enemy of real-time computation. Latency, in the context of a critical real-time application, is the time between data generation and data reception. The reality is that when there is an interconnected network of several systems, there's latency.

While working on the open source ZenTao project, I get constant feedback that getting Agile up and running is a big task in many organizations. As with any new process, you will run into issues, and many of them will feel unique to your organization. While context is important, there's a certain amount of abstraction possible after you've coached enough teams. This article covers the four most common issues I've encountered. While your Agile coach should analyze any actual problems in the context of your organization, knowing these general issues can help better prepare you and your teams for the transitional process.
Note that I only discuss is…]]></summary>

早在今年 2 月，CalDigit 就正式在全球发布了新一代雷电 4 的扩展坞 TS4。作为 TS3 Plus 的升级版本，更多的接口和更高的规格，着实让我有了不少期待。和 CalDigit 的朋友联系之后，我也在 3 月中旬收到了这款真正让我「梦寐以求」的雷电 4 扩展坞。
但关于它和它背后的故事，还要从 2019 年说起。
缘起于 2019 年的一个期待
在 2019 年的年度征文中，我曾经描述过一个符合我需求的理想型扩展坞是怎样的。然而，由于 macOS 系统和雷电 3 的一些限制，我始终没有找到这样一款设备。在前前后后摸索的过程中，总计花掉了近一台 iPhone 11 的钱。
首先，由于 macOS 并不支持通过 DisplayPort 来实现 Display Chain，想要以扩展形式连接显示器就必须占用掉下行的雷电接口，否则就只能镜像显示。其次，雷电 3 在带宽的分配中，硬性规定了必须保留 18Gbps 的带宽用于显示信号（DisplayPort）的传输，实际留给数据传输的空间只有 22Gbps。而且，显示带宽在不足时，还可以占用这为数不多的 22Gbps 数据带宽，反之，就算没有外接显示器，数据带宽也不能使用为显示预留的 18Gpbs。
当时妥协但最好的选择：CalDigit TS3 Plus
直到雷电 4 的到来，这个情况才得以获得改变。
首先，Intel 在雷电 4 协议上取消了为 DisplayPort 预留 18 Gpbs 带宽，提供了满速的 32Gbps 数据传输（相当于 PCIe 3.0×4），尽管还…]]></summary>

Have you ever been stuck or gone blank trying to solve a problem related to something that you just learned from YouTube or Google tutorials? You seem to understand every line of the code, but without the tutorial, you find yourself in a difficult position. If you have looked at problem-solving in HackerRank or LeetCode, you can relate to how an aspiring programmer feels seeing those challenges for the first time. Everything seems out of the box! Being unable to apply what you learned from a tutorial might make you doubt your knowledge and abilities as you begin to understand the basics of the programming language you're learning.

背景提醒：用的是自己电脑(Macbook Pro，Mac版本的万得是永远的痛)，没有太多分享的需求，以及作为买方纪要查的不严，有合规风险的请自行判断哈。以下中英文混杂请见谅。
整体架构和思路
起因：其实很久以前在Notion刚出的时候有尝试过以块结构为基础的笔记软件，但当时觉得只是有些新意以及排版会好看一点，但对于自身的Evernote用户来说并没有太大的吸引力。直到回国后，发现Notion已经有了非常能用的Database功能，加上被国内印象笔记折磨了千百次，才动了尝试迁移到Notion的想法。
需求：在入职成为一个消费研究员之后逐步理清了自己在文档管理方面的需求，发现和Notion能提供的其实非常贴合。作为一个金融行业的研究员，每天会主动被动的接受无数的信息和纪要，而传统的文件夹管理、金融行业常用的有道云对于我来说只能起到一个简单的收集作用而无法后期自动化的为我提供收集归纳的帮助。其实，日常消费研究员的工作就是跟踪行业，跟踪不同的标的(股票)，以及相对应的提供点评。作为一个笔记软件，我希望能够做到自动化、结构化的收纳，便携的搜索，方便快捷添加后期点评。
所以从总体的架构上，我做了如下四个维度的Database： Sectors， Sub-Sectors，Equities和Memos。Sector即大行业，比如食品饮…]]></summary>

We started working on Colonist in 2018 because we wanted to play Catan with our family. None of the online versions were really playable, so, like any programmer would have done, we built our own! Since then, we have worked tirelessly to create the best gameplay experience possible. Over time, we have grown and improved our player experience, and at this point, it is clear that Colonist is ready to become a staple in online strategy gaming.

This is why we are proud to officially announce Ranked Mode and a Leaderboard system for Colonist! Competing in Ranked is easy:

1. Navigate to https://colonist.io/ and select either “Ranked 4P” or “Ranked 1v1” 
2. Play in 10 placement games to establish your Matchmaking Ranking (MMR)
3. After your placement games, you will be placed in matches against players with similar MMR. Fight to move your way up the leaderboard!

In the future, we plan to have prizes for top finishers and create a ladder-like league with divisions. In the meantime, we crave feedback and would love to hear about all of your experiences playing on our site. Please let us know what you think in the comments.

May your roads be long and your armies large,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[某日在盗版网站上津津有味的看着《盗墓笔记重启之极海听雷》，翻着翻着，下一章文风突变，变成了《美艳总裁老婆的废柴入赘老公在家族聚会上送礼》的小故事，一时没把持住，看了600多章。我心想我阅读速度也不慢啊，咋感觉剧情进展这么慢，扫了一眼目录当场石化，好家伙，这文你都能水成2200章，真是要顶礼膜拜了。抽了自己几个大嘴巴以后，想了想还是总结一下为啥爽文是如此的让人无法自拔。咱今日不谈网络文学的好坏，就来聊聊这个「爽」。
爽感的对比
首先要自爆家底，这么多年「良好的阅读习惯」让我有幸接触了《斗破苍穹》、《武动乾坤》、《全职法师》、《牧龙师》、《七界传说》、《星辰变》、《盘龙》、《诛仙》、《盗墓笔记》、《鬼吹灯》等，应该也算是见证过当年网文的盛况，自认为对这一类型文有一定的发言权。
传统文学的爽感体验是以一种循序渐进的方式，缓慢而合理的推进剧情，不断累积读者的情绪和体验，最后在结局中以狂风暴雨般的方式宣泄出来。传统题材的小说也不会特意照顾读者感受，不会去刻意迎合读者口味。而网络爽文使用了一种截然不同的方式，彻底以读者为中心进行创作。读者爱看什么，作者就写什么，其目的只有一个：让读者看的爽。至此，网络文学凭借直白的叙事，通俗的文字，连绵不绝的爽快阅读体验，终于成为了文学作品中不可小觑的一种类型。
如果我们以阅读的进度作为x轴，将「爽」值作为Y轴，按照个人体验我画一张如下的图表（黄色为爽文，绿色为传统文学）。

画的比较抽象还望理解，既然要探究为什么爽文的爽会呈现出类似波浪线的形态，令人爽的难以自拔，可能得先从爽文的代入感说起。
爽感的地基：代入感
所谓代入，即读者以移情的方式，将自身转移到主角身上，从而间接获得主角的世界，以及在剧情推进中获得的各类体验。之所以强调代入感，就好比你隔壁是个富二代，你每天看着人家香车美女的生活必然只会觉得不爽，因为你跟他的生活毫无交集，他的爽你根本无法感同…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文参与数字文具盒征文活动。

我是一个在读的社科博士生。大约一年多以前，我正式进入到博士研究的阶段。很快我发现，博士与硕士本科阶段不同，我面临着文章发表的压力却又缺乏充分的导师指导，由此我开始认真思考如何建立自己的知识管理与任务管理系统。感谢少数派上众多热心作者的分享，让我在这一年里了解并尝试了各种各样的笔记工具、任务管理工具以及方法论体系，并成功浪费了大量学习时间。
然而，虽然每次看到喜欢的新工具都会马上下载使用，我却总是难以坚持下来。在经历了无数次的尝试-放弃循环后，我发觉最重要的不是工具本身，而是容纳这些工具的「盒子」——即如何最简单明了地将文件管理、项目管理、知识管理等等工具融合在一起。
但恰恰是这些基础的东西，大部分的分享都没有详细提及，它们可能没有什么技术含量，但却是入门者最最需要的。因此，我想和大家分享一下我是如何将 Mac 桌面作为我的数字文具盒，搭建简易数字化学术工作流程的，或许能对刚开始入门的朋友有所帮助。
首先谈谈一个普遍存在的问题：

为什么我看到某某博主介绍的某款笔记工具非常酷炫，非常符合自己的需求，但是就是用不下去呢？

可能有这几方面的原因：

工具学习成本过高，难以上手。
工具与自己正在使用的工具功能、工作习惯冲突，无法完全融入到自己的工作流中。
自己太懒工具使用需要耗费时间精力，没有养成使用习惯，产生拖延。

就我自己的探索经历来说，这几方面的问题一般共同存在。
举个例子，初次知道 logseq 这个双链笔记应用的时候，我觉得它就是完美的笔记工具，于是马上下载试用，每天在它的 dailynote 里面记录各种各样的东西，包括每日任务、未来计划、会议记录、研究灵感、阅读笔记，项目总结等等，然后用双链加以整理。
但是一段时间后发现，它和之前的工具产生了冲突。比如我的文献 pdf 是用 Zotero 来管理的，这就导致每次查阅文献都要同时打开两…]]></summary>
