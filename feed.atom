        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When developing APIs, debugging is always a boring problem. 
Postman can help send requests, but when the API body is complicated, constructing a JSON body would be difficult. Junit also works, but all requests must be constructed yourself in testing classes.
Complex bodies make many backends abandon unit tests and output an untested API to frontend developers and QA engineers. 
The above case demonstrates that the code quality declines without a good tool. 
And now, I found that a tool named Apidog can generate the request body automatically when debugging. The tool can construct a correct request JSON itself.
This approach works for API-first teams. APIs are designed before developing, so while debugging, you have an API specification.

Hi all 👋,


So... How many repetitive manual actions do you do each day? Probably a lot! 😐
And why...? Because automating your scattered actions is long and difficult. Don't have time to build and automate a complete process? Neither do I!
Let me highlight an easy way to quickly automate actions without headache with Znote. 
The approach is: Incremental Automation.
Write your process down in a note and start coding parts of your tasks. Thus, you can alternate between manual and automated actions.
I don't know about you, but personally I'm more comfortable learning by testing and prototyping. For me, the best way to achieve this was to use a Javascript playground using Markdown.

The European Commission is opening the door for European airlines to begin offering inflight 5G connectivity, the organization has announced, by allocating certain spectrum for inflight 5G as well as “previous mobile technology generations.” Passengers will connect to an on-board pico-cell base station, which then connects to ground-based networks via satellite. Calls, texts, and data are all expected to be supported.
“5G will enable innovative services for people and growth opportunities for European companies,” said EU commissioner Thierry Breton. “The sky is no longer a limit when it comes to possibilities offered by super-fast, high-capacity connectivity.” The Commission’s announcement does not offer details on exactly when 5G...

A REST (Representational state transfer) API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.


Let's say you have an API to fetch a student data. In a typical REST scenario, this is what the request/response would look like:

Phones used to act as the host for computer communication. Modems sent signals from computer to computer by utilizing the phone network. In today's world, though, computers have become the host for telephony apps. Phones aren't really phones any more, they're literal computers. This has enabled some amazing technology, but many people wonder whether we've lost something by giving up the concept of public phones. The PhilTel project in Philadelphia is seeking to change the trajectory of phone communication by reviving some old concepts. I was intrigued, so I spoke to Mike Dank about this exciting and unexpected development.

Finding good quality, open source audio samples can be a challenge. I've been getting increasingly into composition and creating music in my spare time, using the open source tool Ardour and the creator-focused distribution Ubuntu Studio. I've been looking for samples of specific sounds or loops to include.
I'm familiar with many tools to find images, but until recently, I hadn't come across a similar option for audio resources.

Finding specific sounds can be challenging if you can't record them yourself. Several resources are available, but not many provide sounds under an open source license.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[「就大多数事情而言，最好的学习方式是自己动手去做、去练习。」
在宣传片制作课的最后一个视频，老师留下了这段让我印象深刻的话，以此为契机，我也写出了自己在宣传片主题的第一篇 教程文章。
在此之前，因为对宣传片的设计感兴趣，我注册学习了资深宣传片制作人 Derek Lieu 的 宣传片制作课，在过往养成的知识管理习惯的帮助下，课程中的所学也顺利进入了我的知识库，变成了一篇篇的笔记。
成堆的笔记令人安心，我甚至用一个周末重新梳理了这些笔记，将它们分门别类、放在了目录索引中，但直到某一刻，我突然感觉这样下去是不行的，我想起了 Derek Lieu 在课程结尾说过的话，意识到自己依然停留在「持续学习」的舒适圈中，没有最终的实践，我就还算不上掌握自己所学的东西。
我在笔记软件 Obsidian 里攒上了一堆宣传片的笔记
显然，我需要创造实践的机会，但具体应该做些什么？我的脑海中蹦出了两个选择，一个是制作宣传片，另一个是写文章。
我最终选择了后者，因为我清楚自己学宣传片并不是为了制作、而是为了借此帮更多人做好宣传片，让好的游戏被更多人看到，而且文章是我更熟悉的创作形式，可以更快的启动、预期的产出速度也更快，这意味着我可以更快的获取反馈，从而学得更快。
但当我真的开始做这件事，我才发现这比想象得要难，有 3 个问题摆在了我的面前：

有太多想写的文章主题，每一个都想写
在宣传片这一主题下，我此前从未写过原创的教程文章，很担心表达会太硬核、劝退读者
我并没有实际的宣传片制作经验，很难不怀疑仅靠这种半吊子自学，能写出多少有价值的内容

不过这篇文章能发出来，也说明我最终或多或少解决了这些问题、写完了文章，至于我是怎么做的，这就来说一说。
选题
正如开头所说，在动笔之前，我面临的第一个问题是潜在选题太多。
我日常会在效率软件 Notion 里管理自己的创作选题，每当有想写的文章选题时，我就会临时…]]></summary>

有时，你需要通过文件传输文件。有很多文件共享服务，但是大多数的共享服务都要求你发送你的文件到互联网上。当两台计算机并排在一起或在一栋建筑物中时，通过互联网传输文件，这似乎看起来绕了很远的路（更不用说隐私问题）。开源的 WinSCP 实用程序会使其很轻易地通过网络将一个文件或一个文件夹从你的 Windows 计算机传输到你的 Linux 计算机。

IP 地址

在你可以传输之前，你必须知道目标计算机的 IP 地址或完全限定域名。假设它是一台在你的同一个网络上的计算机，并且你没有运行 DNS 服务器来解析计算机名称，你可以在 Linux 计算机上使用 ip 命令来找到目标 IP 地址：

[linux]$ ip addr show |grep 'inet '
inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo  
inet 192.168.1.23/24 brd 10.0.1.255 scope global noprefixroute eth0


127.0.0.1 是一个 环回地址loopback address ，计算机仅使用它来自我通信，因此在这个示例中，正确的地址是 192.168.1.23 。在你的系统中，IP 地址可能会看起来有所不同。如果你不确定哪个是哪个，你可以逐个尝试到你找到正确的 IP 地址 （然后，在一些地方写下来！）

或者，你可以查找你的路由器设置，它列出了所有通过 DHCP 分配的地址。

WinSCP 命令使用 OpenSSH 协议，因此，你的 Linux 计算机必需运行 OpenSSH 服务器软件，并且你的 Linux…]]></summary>

系统管理员知道，在一台运行着的现代计算机上会发生很多事情：应用程序在后台运行、预定事件等待在特定时间被触发、事件写入日志文件、发送状态报告。在以前，不同的进程可以通过一系列 Unix 工具，来进行有效地管理和监控。然而，现代的计算机运作更为复杂了：本地服务与容器化应用程序一同运行、能够轻松访问云及其运行的集群、实时进程、以及有比以往都多的数据。

拥有统一的管理方法不但是用户想要的，也是忙碌的系统管理员所迫切渴望的。为了完成这项重要的任务，系统守护进程system daemon （systemd） 被开发出来，并迅速被所有主要的 Linux 发行版所采用了。

当然，systemd 并不是管理 Linux 系统的唯一方式，还有许多其他可供选择的初始化系统，包括 sysvinit、OpenRC、runit、s6 和 BusyBox，但 systemd 将 Linux 视为一个统一的数据集，意味着 systemd 能用强大的工具对 Linux 进行一致的操作和查询。对于忙碌的系统管理员和许多用户来说，systemd 的速度和易用性是一个重要的特性。有以下的五个原因。

启动管理

启动 Linux 计算机可能是一件非常罕见的事情。服务器的正常运行时间通常以 年 来计算，而不是月或周。笔记本电脑和台式机可能会频繁地关闭和启动，但更多的时候它们是被挂起或休眠了。无论哪种类型，最近一次开机的时刻都可用于检查一段时间内的计算机健康情况，因为当你在监视系统或诊断问题时，这一时刻能够限制查看的数据量大小，从而让你快速地找到问题所在。

如果你不记得上次启动计算机的时间，你可以使用 systemd 的日志记录工具 journalctl，来列出计算机的所有启动会话：

While much of our Cyber Monday coverage spans a wide range of prices, it’s no secret that the biggest savings are usually on the expensive, showy stuff like TVs. But if you’ve got a lengthy list for your upcoming holiday gift exchange, or you just need to stretch your budget a little more this year, look no further than these early Cyber Monday deals under $25 you can grab now.
While anyone can find cheap crap on sale during Black Friday and Cyber Monday (just open up Amazon’s page and count all the items from brands you’ve never heard of), we’re compiling the best budget-friendly deals we know won’t steer you wrong.

You know how most streets in US towns look exactly the same, barring a few differences? That’s kind of how Cyber Monday is to Black Friday. Many of its deals should be familiar if you’ve been paying attention throughout the Thanksgiving weekend, even though it’s taking on another name. If you haven’t been tuned in, well, you’re in for a treat. There are so many best-ever deals on tech like noise-canceling headphones and earbuds, iPads, video games, budget-friendly gadgets, and a lot more (pour one out for the $569 48-inch LG A2 OLED TV at Best Buy, which is no longer available).
We’re serving you the best-of-the-best deals right up top, just below a handy table of contents that’ll help you zip around to your preferred product category.

Gran Turismo creator Kazunori Yamauchi isn’t ruling out a PC port for the long-running racing sim franchise. In an interview with GTPlanet (via Eurogamer) during the Gran Turismo World Finals on Sunday, Yamauchi told the outlet that the Polyphony Digital development team is “looking into” bringing the series from PlayStation to PC.
“Gran Turismo is a very finely tuned title,” Yamauchi told GTPlanet, while also expressing some concern about getting the game to consistently run in 4K at 60 frames per second across all platforms. “It’s not a very easy subject, but of course, we are looking into it and considering it.”
Gran Turismo 7 was released exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 back in March, and its potential jump to PC...

Here’s a good deal: a big swath of Sonos’s speakers and soundbars are 20 percent off through Cyber Monday. The sale is now live at Sonos’s website as well as Best Buy, Target, and other retailers.  Pretty much everything is at its lowest price ever, and while there are some notable exclusions — including the Sonos Roam, Five, and Sub Mini — it’s still a great time to fill out your Sonos system.


Deals on Sonos soundbars and subwoofers







The Sonos Arc is their flagship soundbar with Dolby Atmos, perfect for pairing with that big-ass new TV. It’s $720 at Best Buy, Sonos, and Target, which is better than $900. (read our review)
The Sonos Beam (second gen) is smaller, and half the price (currently $360 at Best Buy, Sonos, and Target). It...

The holiday shopping season is well underway, and several retailers, including Target, are offering some spectacular early Cyber Monday deals for this annual shopping event. Some of the best discounts we’re currently seeing extend to wireless earbuds like the Beats Studio Buds ($89.99), as well as TVs like Vizio’s 50-inch M6-Series QLED (now $399.99). And if you’ve been putting off buying up until now, this may be the day to do it: many of the deals that Target is offering have been dropped still lower ahead of Cyber Monday.


Here, we’ve collected some of the best discounts you can find at Target, many of which will be available through Thanksgiving weekend and price matched elsewhere. Target has been rolling out new deals every Sunday...

Black Friday may have come and gone, but Best Buy is still offering its best deals of the year ahead of Cyber Monday, much like it has been for the past several weeks. But now that Thanksgiving is wrapped up, we took a spin through Best Buy’s catalog to see what else it might have added to the sale. You’ll find its best online and in-store deals below on video games, 4K TVs, headphones, smartwatches, and so much more. We’ll keep this page updated throughout the weekend, as well as during Cyber Week.


A few important things to note from Best Buy’s frequently asked questions page: it isn’t offering rain checks on Black Friday deals that sell out, though its great price-matching policy won’t be in effect from now through Cyber Monday, which...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你可以先回忆一下，在你目前的人生阶段里，让你有明显成长的三件事是什么？
不用现在立刻给我答案，我也准备了我的答案在文章最后，等你看完文章我们可以一起对一下。
不管你的答案是什么，我猜想，你的成长时刻一定存在着「他者」，这个「他者」也许是对你来说重要的人，也许只是一个陌生人的一句话，或者是某个概念或某种信念。但是他们的共同点是：具备否定性。
很多人都说，当有人否定我们的时候，我们应该想办法回击，因为我们需要“正能量”。但是，如果在一个团体里，大家全部都是相互夸赞，充满正能量，那么它很可能落入了充满虚假肯定性的陷阱里。
信息的同质化
我们总会忘记回看之前收藏的文章和视频。
在《囤积癖：为何我们收藏很多，却毫无进步》1 里说，微信里的文章收藏、读书软件里的划线笔记、豆瓣里的待读清单，我们总是会囤积一些自己无法消化的内容，然后产生了一种“我已经看过的”错觉。
「知晓」并不等于「知道」，我们收藏的未消化的信息越多，内心的压力也就越大，而去主动学习和消化的动力就越小，直到曾费心收藏的内容被遗忘掉。而不断地切换和遗忘，造成了时间的徒然浪费。这还是文字，更遑论视频。
在视频平台上，我们都无法对其中有价值的内容进行复制和粘贴，对于视频内容的消化和吸收的门槛更高了。但是，我们点赞收藏的行为门槛却更低。我们能做的只有点赞和收藏，双击就能点赞，产品设计让行为门槛极低，其初衷并非是帮助你更好地学习，而是让你贡献数据。
因此在算法推荐下，我的点赞、停留时长、收藏等下意识行为，成为了数据养分。这样一来，我们会看到更多自己能够快速接受和喜欢的内容，自然地过滤掉与自身想法相悖的内容。所以我们收集的内容大多都是同质化的信息，这些信息的同质化让个人的信息系统变得臃肿和杂乱。
这种臃肿和杂乱，最后会演变成「梗死」。
局部组织由于血管阻塞、血流停止导致缺氧而发生的坏死，称为梗死。梗死的问题不是遭遇了病毒，而是积累了…]]></summary>

近年来软件功能越来越丰富，但是设置步骤也逐渐繁琐。虽然很多软件推出了自己的云同步服务，只需要登陆账号就可以在多台设备中同步设置。但是仍旧有多数软件并没有多设备间的同步功能，如何解决这一软件之间同步成了一个课题。本文抛砖引玉，使用开源软件 mackup 对设备中无法进行云同步的软件进行配置的备份与还原。
使用 Mackup

Mackup 是一款基于 python，适用于 Linux/macOS 的命令行备份软件，只需要简单输入几行命令，就可以把应用程序的配置文件备份或还原。Mackup 支持目前市面上主流的云存储，比如 Dropbox、iCloud、OneDrive 等等，通过将备份文件存储到云存储中，再在另一台电脑上还原的方式同步配置。
我们以在 macOS 下备份 Raycast 配置为例：
安装 Mackup
Mackup 提供了 brew 与 pip 两种安装方式，我们可以通过以下命令安装：
brew install mackup 
# 使用 brew 安装

pip install --upgrade mackup
# 使用 pip 安装
配置
安装完成之后我们需要对与 mackup 进行配置，mackup 的配置文件为 ~/.mackup.cfg ，我们可以通过 vi 或者nano 进行编辑
vi ~/.mackup.cfg
在配置文件中我们首先需要选择使用的存储备份方式（默认为 Dropbox），我们使用 iCloud:
[storage]
engine = icloud
directory = .config/mackup
engine 参数表示选择的备份存储方式，directory 则是你需要备份存放的位置。
mackup 在备份上提供了多种选择：

老王点评：说到底，安全不仅仅是上游开发者的问题，更多是下游使用者的问题。




72% 的美国员工希望将简单重复的工作交给 AI

根据一项调查，72% 的美国员工会将发票管理、审计和简单的报告等工作任务委托给 AI，以便他们能够专注于使他们在工作中成长的任务。调查还发现，比起年长的工人，更多的 Z 世代对 AI 帮助他们工作感兴趣。

        <id>https://linux.cn/article-15294-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</id>
        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15294-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[htop 是一个流行的命令行工具，可以帮助监测 Linux 上的系统资源和性能。

它比通常默认开箱即用的 top 好。

使用 htop，你可以对进程进行过滤和排序，以便更好地了解情况，获得正在运行的进程的树状视图，并在需要时杀死进程。



我使用 htop 而不是其他系统监控工具，因为它可以显示对我来说至关重要的东西，并允许在我需要控制运行中的服务时终止流氓进程或冻结进程。

但是，如果你想要其他显示更多信息，或一个看起来不同的东西，有哪些htop 替代品呢？让我们来看看。

1、atop



atop 可以提供所有运行的进程的细节。你可以得到你需要的所有数据，以了解你系统上的进程情况。

它还提供了对资源利用率进行永久记录的能力，以便进行长期分析。系统管理员可能会发现这比其他工具更有用。

不幸的是，它并没有为你提供漂亮的输出。因此，如果你想要的话，请继续看下面的其他替代品。

如何安装 atop？

对于基于 Ubuntu/Debian 的发行版，键入：

sudo apt install atop


2、vtop



如果你想要一个漂亮的输出和管理进程的基本功能，vtop 是一个完美的系统监控工具。

正如我在其他一些文章中所说，它的输出看起来像终端中的 GUI。你可以使用鼠标，也可以选择禁用它。也可以定制它的主题。

它是用 Node.js 构建的。所以，你需要安装额外的包来安装它。

不幸的是，这个项目似乎不再积极维护。但是，在写这篇文章的时候，它对我来说还是有用的。

如何安装 vtop？

对于基于 Ubuntu 的发行版，在终端输入以下命令：

sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
sudo npm install -g vtop


3、btop++



btop++ 是 bashtop 和 bpytop 的一个 C++ 版本。是的，它是这些项目的第三次迭代，由同一个开发者完成。

btop++ 包括完全的鼠标支持，带有一个受游戏启发的菜单系统，可以让你过滤进程、树状视图等等。

如何安装 btop++？

使用官方软件库，你可以很容易地在 Fedora、openSUSE 和 FreeBSD 上安装它。

对于 Fedora，你可以键入：

sudo dnf install btop


你可以探索它的 GitHub 页面，了解在其他 Linux 发行版上的安装方式。

4、Glances



Glances 与 htop 类似，但有更多的功能。

它是一个跨平台的系统监控工具，可以将数据以 CSV 或其他格式导出，用于 InfluxDB、Elasticsearch 等。

你也可以利用它的网页用户界面，远程（或在不能访问终端的情况下）查看统计数据。

如何安装 Glances？

对于基于 Ubuntu 的发行版，你可以键入：

sudo apt install glances


5、nmon



nmon 是一个令人印象深刻的监测工具，它可以让你控制你想显示的输出内容。

你可以提取监测数据（以 CSV 格式导出）并用于进一步分析。它很容易切换统计数据和在不同的视图之间进行切换。

默认情况下，它每两秒刷新一次数据，但你可以自定义它，并使用更多的选项来调整你的体验。

如何安装 nmon？

你可以在官方软件库中找到它。对于基于 Ubuntu 的发行版，在终端键入以下内容：

sudo apt install nmon


总结

top 2022

top 命令工具被植入在你的 Linux 系统中。如果你想要一个基本的监控工具，想要关注系统进程和一些统计信息，top 就足够了。

我不确定它是否可以算作比 htop 更强的体验，这也是 top 没有被列入主要列表的原因。

正如你在这里看到的，一些监控工具可能很有趣，而且证明比 htop 更有洞察力。

你最喜欢的 htop 替代品是什么？你认为 htop 对你的使用情况来说已经足够了吗？欢迎在下面的评论中让我知道你的想法。

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。 
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

近期做了工作的调整，离职前和团队做了一些经验分享和自我的反思，作为自己的告别礼物。未曾想老东家做内部培训的同事在听闻这件事之后，联系到我希望我可以聊聊离职前的感受（可能很少有工作十年的中年人会坦然地向上下级谈自己的欠缺或不足，即便是即将离职的人），索性便有了这篇文章。希望自省的同时也可以提供一些包括但不限于工作习惯，职场心态和自我规划的建议。
笔者过去工作经验均在传统机械行业，所思所想会有一定的局限性，还请批判性阅读，择其善者而从之。
主动沟通
刚工作的时候，笔者自忖是一个乐观主动的人，从未想过自己在工作的时候可以如此「内向」：经常遇到了问题会卡在那里默默思考和钻研，看起来很努力，实际上却数日毫无进展，直到临近交付节点才会意识到问题的严重性，最终使自己日渐焦虑。直到汇报前才向直线领导坦承自己无法搞定一份材料且没有临时解决方案。
这时候领导的一句话让我茅塞顿开：这个任务并不是让你一个人完成，你要学会去和相关方沟通，调动资源。实际上，我也不清楚这份材料里的数据如何得出来，但我相信可以通过项目经理那边拿到解释相关数据的人名单。
这件事之后，便明白了主动沟通的必要性：遇到不确定或者不明白的事情，主动问询并不丢脸。反而能够让你用最短的时间更加深度了解事件原委，而非像我一样把事情积压在自己手里，硬生生把大家的工作变成了自己的问题。但在问别人问题之前也需要要求自己从自我专业的角度做出合理的理解和判断，而非诸事仰赖他人。
而对于经常要做汇报的职场人，总是不可避免的会涉及的其他业务相关方。那么建议在向更高级领导汇报前可以事前和相关方进行沟通，以…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pantheon 是 elementary OS 的默认桌面环境。本快速指南解释了在 Arch Linux 中安装 Pantheon 桌面环境的步骤。


Pantheon 是 elementary OS 使用的一个漂亮的桌面环境。它基于 GTK3（GTK4 移植正在进行中）和 Vala，是一个漂亮而干净的桌面，为你提供了一个精致的 Linux 桌面体验。

该桌面主要由 elementary OS 使用。elementary OS 提供了 Pantheon 桌面的修改版，它是基于 GNOME 的。

elementary OS 基于 Ubuntu LTS 版本。因此，在基于 Ubuntu 的发行版中安装 Pantheon 桌面是超级容易的。这意味着如果你想在不安装 elementary OS 的情况下体验 Pantheon，在 Ubuntu 中这只需要一两个命令就可以安装。

在 Fedora 中，你也可以使用组包进行安装。然而，一个以 Fedora 为基础，名为 Ultramarine Linux 的发行版默认提供了它。

但是，在 Arch Linux 中安装 Pantheon 需要一些工作。它不是用简单的 pacman 命令就能直接完成的，而且不能开箱即用。需要一些配置，这可能会破坏你的系统。

这里我给你提供了在 Arch Linux 中安装 Pantheon 桌面的指南和步骤。

警告： 第一次可能不顺利，所以我建议你在物理系统上安装前先在虚拟机上进行。因为在 Arch 中安装 Pantheon 并不像在 Arch Linux 中安装 GNOME、Xfce 和 KDE Plasma 桌面那样流畅。它还需要一些额外的手动配置。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[引言
AI数字绘画技术的发展历程
最近一年多的时间里AI技术凭借大模型和新的算法在诸多领域产生了可见的突破性进展，对于普通人而言基于AI的图像处理和文本处理技术已经逐步改变了我们的生活。AI绘画技术悄然兴起然后受到广泛的关注，这是一个如此典型的范例一方面让我们感受到了AI的强大，另一方面又不得不重新思考我们与AI的关系：我们是不是马上会被技术替代了？
首先来看看这一波AI绘画技术发展的历程：

2021年1月，OpenAI 公布了 DALL-E，奠定了扩散模型在这一波技术发展中的重要性。
2021年10月，开源的文本生成图像工具 disco-diffusion诞生，此后有相当多的基于此的产品出现。
2022年7月，OpenAI旗下人工智能在线绘图应用DALL·E 2在7月份的公测。
2022年8月，stability.ai开源了Stable Diffusion , 这是目前可用性最高的开源模型，很多商业产品都基于此，如 NovelAI。10月18日，Stability.ai宣布完成 1.01 亿美金的种子轮融资，估值达 10 亿美金。

自从几个重要的开源模型发布以来，基于次开发的一些门槛较低的AI绘画生成平台多次在社交网络上爆红，早几个月的Midjourney以及近期国内发布的意间AI等产品吸引了众多没有技术背景的素人参与AI创作和讨论，并开启了诸多商业渠道的流量密码。（更多相关内容推荐阅读《万字解读AI绘画商业化之路：工具、作品与版权》《从起因到争议，在 AI 生成艺术元年聊聊 AI》）
站在这个时间点讨论AI绘画与设计
除了猎奇和投机，也已经有很多相关行业的从业人员从各个方面讨论了AIGC(Artificial Intelligence Generated Content)对于各个行业的影响，最多的包括艺术创作行业与设计行业。由于早期的AI模型（disco-diffu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[123456 才是第二常见的密码

NordPass 发布了 2022 年最常见的密码名单，排名第一的是 “password”，其次是 “123456”、“123456789”、“guest”、“qwerty” 以及更多不需要破解工具就能知道的密码。除此以外，还有很多设备的默认密码也很流行。此外，密码也经常随着流行趋势而变化，比如奥斯卡颁奖、流行电影等等。


消息来源：Nordpass



老王点评：大多数密码的作用相当于“防君子不防小人”的纱门一样。




谷歌称互联网的六成是重复内容

谷歌工程师 Gary Illyes 在一次演讲中称，互联网上六成的内容是重复的。但他没有对重复进行定义。互联网上有大量重复内容是众所周知的事实，问题是比例有多大，作为最大最流行的搜索引擎，谷歌给出了它的答案。


消息来源：SE Roundtable



老王点评：毕竟互联网的主要内容来自 ICP —— Internet Copy & Paste。🤣




Ubuntu Touch 发布新版本，但仍基于六年前的 Ubuntu

这个可以在智能手机和平板电脑上运行的 Linux 发行版推出了最新版本 OTA-24，继续支持来自华硕、谷歌、LG、一加、三星、索尼、小米和其他供应商的各种设备。这个版本继续基于 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS，向 Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 的过渡仍在进行。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：能继续保持更新已属不易，过渡到新的 Ubuntu 版本确实需要很长时间。没有商业公司支持的开源项目，往往很难。]]></summary>

Brian McCafferty

I love Christmas decorations and lights, and I'd been wanting to do an programmable LED project for a long time. Recently, I built a light array made of LED lights, ping pong balls, and a Raspberry Pi Zero. I thought it was worth sharing, because it ended up being relatively easy but also educational.
It's mostly my own design, with some inspiration from YouTube videos. You can find the source code and build instructions in my Git repository.

远程桌面客户端允许你连接到任何其他桌面/服务器，并远程执行任务。它是一种重要的 IT 支持和商业用例。在 Linux 中，有许多远程桌面客户端可用。其中一些是免费的，而另一些是付费版本。所有这些客户端都支持流行的 远程桌面协议Remote Desktop Protocol（RDP），如 VNC、RDP 等等。

本文将介绍一些适用于 Ubuntu 和其他发行版的最佳免费远程桌面客户端。该列表包括自由开源的应用程序，以及一些免费使用但专有的应用程序。

注意：你的目标系统中需要一个远程桌面服务器（如 Xrdp）来成功建立远程连接。然后你才能使用以下应用程序进行连接。这是一个双向的过程。如果你想了解更多的情况，请参考我们的一个案例研究：


通过 RDP 从 Windows 连接到 Ubuntu


适用于 Linux 的最佳远程桌面客户端

GNOME Connections



第一个远程桌面客户端是一个原生的 GNOME 应用程序：GNOME 连接Connections 应用。这个基于 GTK 的应用程序带来了一个简单的用户界面。它是一个非常适合初学者的应用程序。它可以在一分钟内快速设置和连接（如果你知道 IP 和其他细节）。

此外，它还提供了清晰的指示，说明你是要连接到 Linux 还是 Windows。GNOME 连接应用支持 VNC（针对 Linux）和 RDP（针对 Windows）协议。

用 Flatpak 安装这个应用程序超级简单。设置你的系统以使用 Flatpak，并使用以下命令进行安装：

flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Connections

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fedora Silverblue 是 基于 Fedora Linux 构建的桌面操作系统。它非常适合日常使用、开发和基于容器的工作流程。它提供了 众多优势，例如能够在出现任何问题时回滚。如果你想在 Fedora Silverblue 系统上更新或变基到 Fedora Linux 37（这些说明与 Fedora Kinoite 类似），本文将告诉你如何操作。它不仅向你展示了该做什么，而且还向你展示了在发生不可预见的事情时如何恢复。

在实际对 Fedora Linux 37 进行变基之前，你应该应用任何待定的更新。在终端中输入以下内容：

$ rpm-ostree update


或通过 GNOME 软件Software 应用安装更新并重新启动。

使用 GNOME 软件应用变基

在更新页面上，GNOME 软件Software 应用向你显示有新版本的 Fedora Linux 可用。



你需要做的第一件事是下载新镜像，因此请点击“下载Download”按钮。这需要一些时间。完成后，你将看到更新已准备好安装。



点击 “重启并更新Restart & Upgrade” 按钮。此步骤只需要几分钟，最后计算机将重启。重启后，你将获得全新的 Fedora Linux 37 版本。很简单，不是吗？

使用终端变基

如果你喜欢在终端中完成所有操作，那么本指南的这一部分适合你。

使用终端变基到 Fedora Linux 37 很容易。首先，检查 37 分支是否可用：

$ ostree remote refs fedora


你应该在输出中看到以下内容：

fedora:fedora/37/x86_64/silverblue


如果你想置顶当前部署（该部署将作为 GRUB 中的选项保留，直到你删除它），你可以通过运行以下命令来完成：

# 0 is entry position in rpm-ostree status
$ sudo ostree admin pin 0


要删除置顶部署，请使用以下命令：

# 2 is entry position in rpm-ostree status
$ sudo ostree admin pin --unpin 2


其中 2 是 rpm-ostree 状态中的位置。

接下来，将你的系统重新设置为 Fedora Linux 37 分支。

$ rpm-ostree rebase fedora:fedora/37/x86_64/silverblue


最后，要做的最后一件事是重新启动计算机并引导至 Fedora Linux 37。

如何回滚

如果发生任何不好的事情，例如，如果你根本无法启动到 Fedora Linux 37，这很容易回滚。在引导时选择 GRUB 菜单中的上一个条目（如果你没有看到它，请尝试在引导过程中按 ESC），你的系统将以切换到 Fedora Linux 37 之前的先前状态启动。要使此更改永久生效，请使用以下命令：

$ rpm-ostree rollback


就是这样。现在你知道如何将 Fedora Silverblue 变基到 Fedora Linux 37 并回滚。那么为什么不在今天做呢？

家有一猫，叫咪咪。傻乎乎的，每天除了吃饭就是睡觉，好吃懒做也不学习，甚至连猫叫都不会。可能正是因为它不会猫叫，有强烈的自卑情绪，生活态度非常消极，日渐肥胖。为了让一只不会喵喵叫的小猫咪积极面对生活，我们决定用宠物交流按钮来代替猫叫，让咪咪学会「说话」。
教学理念
受启发于 狗狗Bunny 和 B 站的一只猫咪叫 福福 ，他们能用不同的按钮发声去表达自己的需求。我们也打算采用同样的方法，训练小猫咪通过按压不同按钮后发出的「吃饭」、「开门」、「贴贴」等不同声音来表达自己当下的需求。
整个学习过程的基本原理是条件反射，条件反射分为经典条件反射和操作性条件反射。经典条件反射，最有名的例子便是巴浦洛夫的狗。在每次给予食物前，先播放一段铃声，反复多次后，狗狗便学会了将铃声（条件刺激）和奖励（食物）之间建立联系。操作性条件反射，最早是由新行为主义代表人物斯金纳提出，在斯金纳箱（一个带有操作杆的箱子）中探索的实验小鼠需要将主动按压操作杆（动作）和获得奖励（食物）之间建立联系。操作性条件反射是将主动行为与奖励建立联系，而经典条件反射是将被动听到的铃声刺激与奖励建立联系，学习过程更为简单。另外，条件刺激（按压操作杆/铃声）与非条件刺激（获得食物）之间的间隔时间颇为重要，间隔越短越容易建立联系。
当前案例下，需要让小猫咪建立不同按钮和不同反馈之间的联系，这本身是一个操作性条件反射。但在过去生活经历中，小猫咪已经将其他行为（例如踢饭盘）与获得猫粮相绑定，所以需要考虑消退该联系。另外，猫咪的生活环境和斯金纳箱中的小鼠不同，盒中环境简单，探索到操作杆非常…]]></summary>

Programmable hardware
I would love to recommend the Digirule2. I want one for myself! Unfortunately, they are out of stock.
The Digirule2 is an 8-bit programmable minimal instruction set computer in the style of the Altair 8800, where you enter a program in machine code. It’s a great way to explore programming, or to teach others how programming works at the hardware level with machine code. Every program instruction …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[早早的在官网预订，结果大半年才轮到我，又在转运中心呆了一个月。拿到手之后没多久京东自营店就开始卖了，而且是价格差不多的现货。感觉就像当年买了特斯拉没多久就频繁降价的吃瘪心理。不过现在这些都过去了，深度体验了一段时间之后，我想聊聊机器本身。和横空出世的特斯拉Model 3类似，这台机器有太多可以聊的内容了。
注意文章很长，且没什么可以跳过的地方。

为什么没有必要用续航和性能评价SteamDeck
在等待到货的日子里面看了很多测评，但当我实际拿到手里之后，发现测评的方向有偏差，或者说人们对这款机器的期待陷入了思维定势。
产品测评不好做
虽然我们现在习惯在购买电子产品之前先看评测，但是评测的最大问题是使用时间极短，常规升级的新产品还能简单梳理下升级点，但对于有突破性的新产品，评价往往会非常片面且不客观。更何况许多做测评的年轻人本身能力有限，无法做到面面俱到。例如以豪华内饰的汽油车为标准来评价Model3，这辆车将会是一无是处。这同样适用于SteamDeck，它的参照物并不是NS。
SteamDeck的产品定位是让人可以随时随地流畅地玩PC上的各种类型游戏，从独立小作品到年货3A大作，这个定位非常重要，后文会反复出现。拆解这个定位来看，“随时随地”意味着便携性，“流畅”意味着软硬件基础，“各种类型”则意味着整合的能力。
这算是一篇夹杂了许许多多主观想法的个人产品评价报告。
人们习惯于使用评价手机和电脑的标准去评价SteamDeck，首先是续航，接着是性能，然而对于什么是“好”的定义都差别巨大。由于母公司Valve另一款产品Steam在世界范围内的成功，所以这台主机理论上不缺乏“护航大作”。他们要做的就是把自家平台上数不清的游戏汇聚到这方寸之地，让玩家可以随时随地沉浸在各种性能需求不同、操作方式不同、对应平台不同的游戏中。讲真，但凡了解Steam的人都该清楚，这是个初见会让人茫然至…]]></summary>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。 
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

作为在智能家居领域耕耘十余年的专业设计师特别想和大家分享我的一些关于智能生活的体验和心得，趁着这次自己家里装修，根据自己的技术经验及实际需求设计了全屋智能家居系统，经过我一年时间的实际生活体验，也总结了一些经验和使用感受，我将分成几个系统单独介绍和分享。
智能暖通系统
暖通系统主要就是空调系统和地暖系统；由于我家的建筑结构和层高等问题，无法使用更方便智能控制的中央空调，所以客厅采用的是海尔的一拖一风管机空调，其他房间采用了米家的壁挂空调，海尔的空调可以使用海尔智家 app 控制，米家的空调可以使用米家 app 控制；地暖系统由于是在南方没有集中供暖，所以都是采用烧天然气的壁挂炉提供热量，各个房间有独立的温控器。
地暖系统
系统介绍
很多人不明白为什么要费劲整个智能的暖通系统，普通的暖通系统不是一样加热工作吗？其实这是很多人的误区，装智能温控系统的最大好处就是帮你省钱！很多朋友家里使用地暖的都知道，每个冬季的取暖费用是一笔很大的开支，平均的燃气费用在 1000-2000 / 月，根据不同的供暖面积以及设置的温度不同，有些甚至可能都超过 2000 的费用，导致有些家庭即使安装了地暖冬季都不敢开启使用，高昂的燃气费用阻碍了人们享受舒适生活的权利。
我自己是一个比较怕冷的人，特别是在杭州这种冬天湿冷的环境下，所以我在装修设计的时候就把地暖作为必选项，也为了让家人能生活在一个舒适的家中。之前给客户设计智能温控系统更多的是考虑方便管理控制，现在自己家里使用更多的也需要考虑使用成本等费用问题。

Stephan Avenwedde
Thu, 11/24/2022 - 03:00

            
In a previous article, I gave an overview of six Python interpreters. On most systems, the CPython interpreter is the default, and also the poll in my last article showed that CPython is the most popular one. Specific to CPython is the ability to write Python modules in C using CPythons extensions API. Writing Python modules in C allows you to move computation-intensive code to C while preserving the ease of access of Python.
In this article, I’ll show you how to write an extension module. Instead of plain C, I use C++ because most compilers usually understand both. I have to mention one major drawback in advance: Python modules built this way are not portable to other interpreters. They only wo…]]></summary>

Seth Kenlon
Thu, 11/24/2022 - 03:00

            
In the Java programming language, an array is an ordered collection of data. You can use an array to store information in a structured way. It's useful to know the various ways you can retrieve that data when you need it. It's worth noting that in Java, an associative array (also called a dictionary in some languages) is called a hashmap. This article doesn't cover hashmaps, but you can read all about them in my Using a hashmap in Java article.
Creating a string array
The simplest array in Java is a one-dimensional array. It's essentially a list. For an array of strings:
package com.opensource.example;
public class Example {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
String[] myArray = {"foo", "bar", "baz"};

环保问题一直是装修中大家密切关注的重点，毕竟即使选择E1\E0\F4级材料，新家具、新柜子都会有气味不断散发出来。装修材料内部和连接处使用的胶会不断分解，散发出醛类、苯系物等挥发性有机物，它们会对人体呼吸系统以及血液系统造成影响。

所以新房通风散味除甲醛是每个家庭都重视的，我的房子次顶楼、南北通，楼前无遮挡，整体通风效果是非常好的。8月初定制柜安装完毕后，我就持续不关窗通风，10月中旬成品家具也正式入屋，后继续通风。两大新房空气污染源分别经过了3个月和一个月的连续通风，如今进入屋内的异样气味感已经明显减少了，为了确定新房的空气质量，计划开展新房空气的自测。
甲醛检测的国标方法

现在关注室内甲醛的人都知道，国标允许的室内甲醛最高浓度为0.10mg/m³，可靠的测试标准为GB/T 18204.26-2000《公共场所空气中甲醛测定方法》。
检测的原理就是让空气中的甲醛与酚试剂反应生成嗪，嗪在酸性溶液中杯高铁例子氧化形成蓝绿色化合物，根据其颜色的深浅，以分光光度计检测标准溶液后进行比色，进而给出定量的检测结果。这一方法对醛类物质有很好的选择性，结果可靠。
从化学角度来讲，这个是非常简单的测定实验，检测结果可靠的核心就是要有严格按照标准规定进行取样，吸收液配置准确，以及有计量溯源可靠的分光光度计和标准物质作为数据支撑。
即使其它检测手段能向国标检测方法的结果进行标定，那也没有分光光度法的可靠性和准确度。
分光光度法之所以准，是因为国标明确说明，仅有二氧化硫会对这方法的检测结果造成影响，一般家庭不存在二氧化硫。
室内甲醛测试的手段与经济投入
1：甲醛测试盒

甲醛测试盒就是简易版的酚试剂测试法，可以不需要分光光度计，每份测试盒内带有酚试剂吸收液，自行根据指导方法封闭房间，摆放吸收液半小时后，倒入铁酸溶液，显色后对比测试盒内附带的比色卡，以肉眼充当分光光度计，来判断颜色情况。…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近，我在尝试使用画图思考。虽然只是简单应用，但是收获颇丰，值得梳理总结出来。 我会从电脑和本子两个方面来说说自己的实践。
电脑
电脑软件上，我来说说 Excalidraw 和 Craft 这两款应用。
Excalidraw

说到画图，Excalidraw 这个应用肯定绕不过。我在电脑上的思路梳理，知识分享，还有学习的沉淀，都在高度依赖这个应用。它是一款在线的白板软件，风格和字体偏手绘风格，我很享受在上面涂涂画画的过程。

思路梳理的时候，我会把自己的问题先写在白板上，然后自由发散，记录下现状。接下来，我会通过观察画布上的一个个关键字，去做分类的和关联的操作。在动手的过程中，很可能一些思路就已经慢慢出来。画布可以很好承载网状的思考，通过拖拽，连线，分层，让我在脑子里混乱的思绪，一步步清晰。如果看着画布上的关键字，一时没有找到解决方案，也不用着急，就安静观察，静下心来，慢慢琢磨。

和朋友分享观点或知识，我亦经常在这个白板上画图。有了白板，我们讨论问题的时候，可以把一些发散的问题记录到一个位置，等主要内容分享完之后，回头继续梳理。白板的展示方式，可以更好吸引对方的兴趣和注意力。我也经常感受到，在和别人交流过程中画图，会不知不觉，产生一个新的观点，或者对自己的思路愈发清晰。

最后说说学习的沉淀，抛开做笔记，我最喜欢的就是面对这个白板做知识的总结。写作困难的地方也许是从零开始，梳理知识应该也是。没有参考的情况下，列出知识大纲，结构化总结，是一件困难的事情。就是这种每次面对白板的梳理，让我可以更好检视自己的学习成果。同时，白板画图，使我我对分层学习，有了更直观的感受。
Craft
Craft 是一款笔记应用。这款应用好在配图和分享非常方便流畅。我在分享给朋友的一些文字上，会配上一张图片。不要小看文章或者句子的配图，这个配图如果合适，会加深对句子的印象。

除了分享的配图，我还会在学习专业书籍时，对目录大纲做一个梳理，同样会配上方便我联想记忆的图片。看目录标题，思考关联图片，搜索图片，然后上传图片到 Craft 的过程，虽然繁琐，但实在是一劳永逸的事情。我回顾知识框架的时候，一看到图片，就会很自然想到，自己当时为什么选择了这种图，这张图含义是什么，大部分都可以直接根据图片，推敲出章节标题。

找图片，激发自己使用右脑联想记忆，这个过程其实步骤很多。经常遇到找不到合适的图片来表达，在这时，我会在 Excalidraw 上画图。过程虽然花费不少时间，但是在这个思考和主动寻找关联关系的过程，其实已经在慢慢消化和记忆知识。

本子
便利贴
我把便利贴当作一个有边界的草稿纸。我在想一些细碎问题的时候，会打开便利贴画一下思路和草图，一个问题，不会超过一张便利贴去思考。举个例子，上周的茶话会，分享前，我在便利贴上圈圈点点，画出大纲和思路。随后我把便利贴揉成一团丢掉，暗示自己思路已经准备就绪。

便利贴的天然边界，和撕下来的特性，很好地辅助了我思考。生活中很多问题会突然出现，便利贴的便利性，就是良好的应对方式。它的第一页，在安静等待着你写写画画，接着被你撕下。一页便利贴没有过多的空间，这个特点，帮助我自然而然去聚焦问题的重点。
子弹笔记
为了让生活中很多琐事更有趣，我会在子弹笔记上，用画图的方式去给自己分配任务。比如，清理卧室，衣柜部分很多衣服需要清点，我就会把衣柜的实物画出来。当我清理完一部分格子，我会用荧光笔涂上颜色。
我在实践中，体会到画图的三个优点。首先是直观，无论是进度还是已经完成的程度，我一眼看上去，都有直观的感知。其次是低压力，看图片去想自己要做什么，和看清单上的文字，压力不一样。最后是愉悦感，看图的时候，因为低压力和直观，让我做事的时候心情更好。

除了通过画图拆分任务，我还使用荧光笔快速分类子弹笔记中的任务。比如，某一天傍晚，我打算采购想要购买的东西。由于子弹笔记是一般是按照流水线的方式记录要任务，我的本子上没有一个页面或者清单专门记录。

很自然地，我拿起某个颜色的荧光笔，在本子上把这几天未完成的购买任务，涂上同样的颜色。很短的时间内，我就快速把购买的东西过滤出来，然后拿出手机去一件件下单。
总结

从电脑上的画图实践，我学习到，多画图可以捋清思路。合适的配图，能加深印象。在本子上的实践，我学习到便利贴的边界能辅助快速思考。最后是，眼睛，分辨颜色和形状效率很高。
我的实践，如标题所言，确实非常简单。即便如此，这些实践也不是我自己凭空想象。《认知心理学》《游戏改变世界》《子弹整理思考术》《活用一辈子的读书笔记术》《一页纸工作整理术》，这五本书对我启发很大。学习和生活，都离不开知行合一。希望自己能够在成长的路上，多实践，多沉淀。]]></summary>

Automated testing is an important stage of development. It helps you ensure code quality, discover bugs before they ship, and guarantee that an application works the way it's intended to work. Deployment of automated tests is rapidly becoming a top priority for companies all over the world.
The latest release of the Cerberus Testing platform offers a series of new features and improvements to allow you to easily set up automated tests for your software engineering team.

For several years, I worked in the TV online and video-on-demand (VOD) industry. While working on a scheduler web application, I realized that there were no good solutions for electronic program guides (EPG) and scheduling. Admittedly, this is a niche feature for most web developers, but it's a common requirement for TV applications. I've seen and analyzed a number of websites that have implemented their own EPG or timeline, and I often wondered why everyone seemed to be inventing their own solutions instead of working on a shared solution everyone could use. And that's when I started developing Planby.
Planby is a React (JavaScript) component to help you create schedules, ti…]]></summary>

Dwayne McDaniel
Tue, 11/22/2022 - 03:00

            
Have you ever found a bug in code and needed to know when it was first introduced? Chances are, whoever committed the bug didn't declare it in their Git commit message. In some cases, it might have been present for weeks, months, or even years, meaning you would need to search through hundreds or thousands of commits to find when the problem was introduced. This is the problem that git bisect was built to solve!
The git bisect command is a powerful tool that quickly checks out a commit halfway between a known good state and a known bad state and then asks you to identify the commit as either good or bad. Then it repeats until you find the exact commit where the code in question was first introduced.…]]></summary>

Marty Kalin
Tue, 11/22/2022 - 03:00

            
Why call C functions from Rust? The short answer is software libraries. A longer answer touches on where C stands among programming languages in general and towards Rust in particular. C, C++, and Rust are systems languages, which give programmers access to machine-level data types and operations. Among these three systems languages, C remains the dominant one. The kernels of modern operating systems are written mainly in C, with assembly language accounting for the rest. The standard system libraries for input and output, number crunching, cryptography, security, networking, internationalization, string processing, memory management, and more, are likewise written mostly in C. These libraries r…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[人要坚持一件事情真的很难，一不小心，少数派思考就鸽了一个多月。上周六我上了一次「得到」的直播，也是罗振宇老师的年度演讲策划会，在会上我提出了两个观点，在这里跟大家分享一下。
用实业心态创业，用实业思维做互联网产品
这句话其实在我脑海中已经很多年了，可能跟我之前从事的传统行业有关系。不管是做哪个行业和产品，我都非常在意它给用户提供的本质价值，比如我推销过纳米汽车清洁产品，就会一直纠结它的实际效果怎么样，不断反馈问题；我出口过弹簧钢丝，也更关注海外客户的使用反馈，了解我们的工艺跟其他国家的差距在哪里。
但互联网的兴起，好像改变了这些底层规则，因为要快、要规模、所以要免费，羊毛要出在猪身上。不知不觉，服务和产品的本质都被动摇了。我非常感恩互联网，因为这个工具和时代，让给我有了创业的机会，帮我把爱好变成了事业，但我不迷信互联网，它是一个好工具，但不是产品和服务的本质。
简单举两个例子：
今天的外卖让我们的餐饮高效便利，但餐饮的本质是菜品和味道，如果菜品难吃又不干净，你送餐的速度的再快也没有意义，我能忍一次两次，忍不了第三次。
今天的娱乐，让我们随时随地可以听音乐，看电影，但平台的争斗和互卷，让创作者无奈，让好的内容越来越少，最终变得没什么可看了。
所以，一个产品和服务，要想保持长期可持续的生命力，就要回归用户需求，用实业思维把东西夯实，夯成自己的真正壁垒，它可能会很慢，规模也不大，但它可以穿越周期，做成百年老店。接下来十年，可能是一个慢下来的新周期，这个思维就更加重要。
直播中有一个提前准备的问题，没来得及讲，我可以在这里补充一下：
当下环境，你会给准备创业的朋友哪些建议和叮嘱？
先想好怎样活下来，今天的市场更加残酷，没有红利、没有资本，用户更谨慎和挑剔。
少讲故事，如果你的业务短期内没法商业化，就要想好长期策略，比如控制成本，小步快跑等等。
别追风口，多关注细分市场的机会，关注年轻的主力消费人群，未来是创意和个性化的时代。
不要社恐，不要闭门造车，要主动联络和运用身边的一切资源。
创新不是颠覆，是将好做到优秀，再把优秀做成经典的过程
这句话不是我说的，而是来自 150 年历史的德国莱茵公司。三年前我前往德国参观了他们的公司和业务，七天行程的结束，莱茵大中华区电子电气副总裁 Jay 总结了这句话，引发了我的思考。
巧合的是，我八年前做出口业务的时候，有很多欧洲的客户，我去了解他们的背景，发现大多都是做了几十年的企业。他们都是深耕自己的领域，比如一家制造扫街刷子的公司，从塑料制刷改成钢丝刷，从扫街到扫管道，不停优化工艺，不停的延伸拓展，始终保持自己的市场地位。
而互联网时代，我们经常讲创新，讲颠覆，强调一个技术出现，就会改变一个行业，我就是这个行业的佼佼者。我们承认趋势的存在，但趋势是波浪，一旦过去了，你还要靠自己的实力去创造价值，只是这个趋势周期比较长，我们还没有真正经历和感受过低谷。
所以我后来一直思考这句话，它可能就是一个百年企业的运营真谛，不要觉得事情小，而是关注它的价值。150 年前的莱茵公司，是给蒸汽锅炉做安全认证的，因为品质不统一，操作不规范，它经常出现致命的事故，先做好这件事，保证工人的生命安全。后面再一点点拓展到更多的领域，最后形成了人人信赖的品牌。
做一份少数派的报告
虽然，以上这些海外企业的成长经历，跟我们的周期和环境有很大区别，但我依然认同这些底层的观点：把一件事情做好做透，拥有你最核心的用户群，先完成你基本的商业闭环，然后再围绕用户和市场的需求去慢慢拓展。这跟以往的互联网思维是基本相悖的，但从更高的维度和更长的周期来看，我依然相信这是正确的。
我们在直播中聊到，是不是可以整理一个具备这些特质的企业清单，讲讲他们的故事，我们可以把它叫做真正的《少数派报告》，也希望这些案例，能在寒冬之中，引领更多创业者找到自己的方向。]]></summary>

最近一时兴起，又在从 1Password「逃离」。这次找到了一款在终端环境下运行的密码管理器 Pass，不仅开源免费，而且还能使用 PGP 算法进行加密，从各种角度来说，都是 1Password 不错的替代品。
话虽如此，单纯使用终端来管理密码始终不太方便。在几经研究之下，终于利用 Alfred 和 AppleScript 研究出可用于系统全域的自动填充系统（而不仅仅是在浏览器范围内）。
话不多说，先看疗效。

在这篇文章中，我会简单地描述如何利用 Pass 构建一个密码保险库，并尝试与 Alfred Workflow 连接起来，完成密码自动填充。
安装 Pass 并初始化保险库
注：本文着重于讲解使用 Alfred Workflow 配合 Pass 快速填充密码，因此本节内容将会较为简略。你可以在互联网搜索相关资料获取更多教程。
要安装 Pass，叫出 macOS 用户的的老朋友 Homebrew 就行。
brew install pass
由于 Pass 不利用主密码、而是 GPG 密钥对来完成保险库加密，因此这个过程中会额外安装 GnuPG。对于大部分普通用户而言，我个人推荐再额外安装诸如 GPG Suite 的密钥管理工具。你可以前往 GPG Suite 的官网 下载到 GPG Suite。
安装好 GPG Suite 之后，打开 GPG Keychain 程序，你可以看到一些密钥展示在屏幕上。

点击顶部「新建」按钮，然后填写你的姓名、电邮地址和一些额外信息。密码（Passphrase）可以不填（可以之后再设置），但…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[茨威格在《人类群星闪耀时》一书中写道：

一个人生命中的最大幸运，莫过于在他的人生中途，即在他年富力强时发现了自己的人生使命。

从这个角度，我属于无敌幸运那一拨。
21 岁五脏滚烫的年纪，我就被自己的人生使命劈中了。
​我认定我的幸福是以一个旁观者的角度审视自己的人生旅途；如果居然行有余力，那以一个故事采集者的角度去记录更多普通人的一生，赋予我们卑微又炽热的生命以超越时空的伟大意义，是我责无旁贷的使命。
是的，我当时一文不名，但幻觉丰沛。

有一天，我们都会死去
尸体烂在泥土里。
死亡并不是一件特别可怕的事
可怕的是该在何处安置我们的故事呢？
有那么一天，我们的故事也会死去
一想到这些
我就克制不住的难过起来

按剧本我接下来应该奋不顾身的投入到这份伟大的事业中，或者年少成名，鲜衣怒马；也或许撞了个头破血流，终究败给了庸俗的生活。
无论结局如何，都该是一段轰轰烈烈的故事。
但我没有，我毕业就跑去上班了，而且一上上了九年。
你能明白么？就是那种人，一边很怂，担心明天的面条米饭、柴米油盐；一边又雄心壮志誓要扼住命运的脖子，像海明威笔下的那个老头一样去大海深处跟鲨鱼搏斗。
我觉得自己就是这种人，一个小心翼翼的猛士。
中途倒是有尝试启动项目，赶在 Web 时代余晖，完成了 80% 第一版本的工作。
接着女儿就出生了，过了几年昏天黑地的日子。那时还没有现在这么成熟的摸鱼技术，工作和老婆孩子都要照顾，人生使命这种事情只能往后放一放。
这一放，距离我被命运劈中过去了十六年。
但真正的爱情经得起考验，真正的使命也经得起等待。
十六年，杨过从唇红齿白变的鬓角飞霜，还是从断肠崖顶跳了下去。
十六年，这事儿一直都在我脑子里一刻不停歇的发着光。现在我变秃了，也变强了，终于可以给她一个交待。
 
这个立志于为普通人树碑立传的新产品，定名「一万年日记」。
其实比起日记，叫传记更准确一些。
截至公元 …]]></summary>

个人评分部分为主观部分，会根据厂家状态、设计、以及个人喜好权重评分，仅供参考。
键帽

GMK
老牌德国键帽厂，不过工期越拖越长，品质也有些不太稳定，但仍旧是铁王座
Tenshi 天使 「misotsu」
来自 IC 信息贴
这款键帽是由设计师misotsu（或许我们可以叫他味增酱）设计，这款键帽是他设计的第一款键帽，也是一款我认为设计得很不错的二创作品，原型是麻枝准的名作Angel Beats（天使的脉动）！
原作宣传图
这套键帽的灵感来自于剧中高人气女角色——立华奏
立华奏角色图
配色：

配色方面，选择了珠宝白、紫罗兰宝石色、豆奶白，取自角色发色和服饰颜色。以珠宝白和紫罗兰宝石色作为基调，复古点缀其中，整体观感偏冷色系。比较契合角色给人的印象，很少有表情变化，同时也非常寡言，「无心」和「冰冷」。
个性部分：

在个性键帽部分，我个人认为是中规中矩，忠于原作的设计。天使登场的羽毛和翅膀，学生服饰的领结，代表战斗能力的Hand sonic（音速手刃），七字回车设计则是Hand sonic 五代形似莲花，是因为可爱而制造的武器。而贯穿作品的暗线，跳动的心脏——女主角与男主角的羁绊，来自于男主角生前捐赠的心脏跳动在女主角的身体里，正如作品标题所示——Angel Beats（天使的脉动）！
渲染展示（仅供参考）：

金属个性：

这枚金属键帽的个性图案，是来自于角色最喜爱的食物——麻婆豆腐。
桌垫：

桌垫 Angel's Down

桌垫 Fallen from grace
键帽信息：
材质：ABS材质
高度：原厂高度
工艺：二次成型
个人评分：5—10
对于二次创作键帽会有更高要求，这款键帽忠于原作的设计，是优点也是限制，根本上来说二次创作的作品都会出现这个问题，不过仍旧有厉害的作者能够做出超越原作的改编，这款键帽的颜色设计我觉…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前段时间，我和小助理录制了一期关于记账的播客。
我个人记账十几年，并从记账这件事中收获许多，小助理的财务状况也在记账后一点点发生改变，故而我俩一致认为记账对大部分人实现攒钱目标是一功不可没的步骤，于是商量着录了这期节目，希望能给大家分享一些关于攒钱和记账的心得与技巧。
这期播客上线后受到了极大的欢迎，不仅上了首页，收获了3万多播放，200多条互动，还有超过千次的收藏，连评论都获得了100多个赞， 这意外的热度让我非常欣慰。
我们团队有位小伙伴在听完这期播客后，认为对她有巨大帮助，并自告奋勇做这期节目的「课代表」，把节目里的干货做一个系统化的整理，然后分享给大家，下面的文字内容就来自小伙伴精心整理的【课程笔记】，希望能为大家提供到行之有效的方法。
 

一、找一个记账方式
 
记账的方式有很多，包括但不限于Excel、备忘录、各种记账app。
方式不重要，选一个习惯用的，适合自己的就行，但不要在这一步上耽搁太久。

我最一开始记账的时候，下载了一大堆记账app，光挑app就花了一个多礼拜的时间，这就很没有必要。选哪种方式都无所谓，重要的是坚持记账。
我自己偏向用Excel，因为莫名觉得记账app的操作都好复杂啊，而且我更习惯自己去分类。
更倾向用app的朋友，可以试下关哥推荐的时光序app，纯净无广，功能强大，除了记账以外，还可以用做日程提醒。
 
二、先做全年预算
有些支出是不能按月去计算的，因为它不一定每个月都有，这样可以给自己一个整体的规划目标感。
比如保费，它是年缴的；再比如国庆节收到的婚礼请柬可能就比较多，但平常的月份，这部分支出就比较少或者干脆没有。
很多人会把这些开销当成一笔意外支出，但实际上，这种情况每年都会发生，所以咱们可以提前把这部分的年预算给做好，至于到底是哪个月花的钱，就不重要了。
这种规划方式同时能帮我们更好的控制支出，也利于后期复盘。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[虽然现在多屏用户逐渐变多，但仍是小众，Windows 也并没过对多屏使用进行太多的优化。所以只好自己动手，于是有了以下一些个人自用的优化设置。
窗口出现位置优化
Windows 系统仅对多屏用户提供了简单主显示器的设置，默认情况下所有新打开的窗口都只会出现在主显示器上，即使你在使用另一个的显示器。而「基于显示器连接记住窗口位置」只能记住上次关闭时所在的屏幕，实用性并不高。

这时微软自家的 Power Toys 里的 FancyZones 就可以派上用场了，除了我们熟知的窗口布局设置外，它还可以调整窗口行为，在这里我们可以通过启用「将新创建的窗口移动到当前 活动的监视器（实验性）」来达到这一效果，美中不足的是动画不够优雅。

窗口出现的问题解决了，但任务栏上默认是显示所有屏幕上的窗口，不能让我们快速区分哪些应用是在当前屏幕下的。

为了解决该问题，如下图所示，Windows 提供了简陋的选项加让人摸不着头脑的翻译。设置后，每个屏幕下的任务栏就只显示当前屏幕下打开的窗口，更符合直觉，不过 Win + 数字 的快捷键就只能在主显示器上使用了。

内容显示优化
现在 Windows 下大部分的应用都适配高 DPI 的，少部分不支持的，也可以通过 Windows 自带的属性 - 兼容性选项来调整。

上面的设置仅解决了单个应用在高分辨率屏幕下的问题，并不能解决应用在分辨率相差太大的显示器间移动时会出现界面变形问题。这时，如果你使用的 AMD 显卡，那你可以通过启用 AMD Radeon Software 里的「超虚拟分辨率」来让低分辨率屏切换到更高的逻辑分辨率，不仅缩小的多屏间的分辨率差距，还有抗锯齿的效果。由于个人没有使用 Nvidia 和 Intel 显卡，相关选项是否存在请自行到显卡设置里翻找。

设置完成后到 Windows 设置调整下逻辑分辨率和缩放即可。

除此之外，对于我们网上冲浪必备的浏览器，它的缩放是固定的，且只有一个设置选项。不知道有没有人跟我一样两个屏幕的缩放比例是不一样的，在两个屏幕间移动浏览器时，网页内容并不会根据 DPI 而变化，导致观感割裂。在这里我推荐一个 FireFox 浏览器插件：ffreszoom，它可以实时感知屏幕宽度的变化，当宽度超过指定值时，自动调整到指定缩放比例。设置前先通过这个网站查看自己的屏幕宽度：http://whatismyscreenresolution.net/，需要将 Firefox 浏览器移动到不同显示器上刷新。

如图所示我的外屏宽度是 1728 px，笔记本内屏为 1024，所以我在两者之间随意取了一个值用于判断，若当前屏幕宽度超过 1600 px，就自动设置缩放为 1.5，也即 150%。若小于 1600 px，则使用浏览器设置里的值。两种缩放无缝切换，只会多了一个缩放的动画。由于本人没使用 Chromium 类浏览器，并没有对应的插件推荐，不过其用户这么多，应该会有类似的插件。

利用「闲置的」触摸板
不知有没有跟我一样喜欢使用笔记本键盘的，且平时一些简单的操作直接用触摸板直接操作。现在 Windows 11 已经支持自定义触摸板多指手势了，但其不能根据不同应用设置不同的手势，例如：A 软件可以用 Ctrl  + W 关闭，但 B 软件只能用 Alt + F4，同一个操作有不同的快捷键。

这时就需要第三方软件了，这里我推荐 GestureSign，界面虽然是 Windows 10 风格，但不影响使用，毕竟设置完就不用再看了。它可以为不同应用的不同快捷键键设置相同的触控手势，手势类型也不再仅限于横平竖直，可以自由发挥。同时软件也内置了一些常用的命令供选择。

上图是我的一些设置，双指一般使用系统默认就不添加上去了。其中个人最爱的是三指滑动切换标签，体验比鼠标点击更加符合人的直觉。对于频繁使用搜索启动器的我，把三指上滑指定为搜索启动器的快捷键，方便呼出。
 
对了，设置前记得把系统自带的相关手势取消掉，不然会冲突。若你仍不习惯使用触摸板，该软件也支持鼠标手势，具体可以自行下载体验。
结尾
以上便是我在使用多屏时遇到的问题，及相关解决方法，希望对多屏用户有帮助。]]></summary>

世界杯赛程赛制
2022年世界杯将在中东国家卡塔尔举办，这是历史上首次在中东地区举办世界杯。
小组赛分组（来源：国际足联官网）
本届世界杯将有32支球队参加，分成8个小组。

A组：卡塔尔，厄瓜多尔，塞内加尔，荷兰
B组：英格兰，伊朗，美国，威尔士
C组：阿根廷，沙特阿拉伯，墨西哥，波兰
D组：法国，澳大利亚，丹麦，突尼斯
E组：西班牙，哥斯达黎加，德国，日本
F组：比利时，加拿大，摩洛哥，克罗地亚
G组：巴西，塞尔维亚，瑞士，喀麦隆
H组：葡萄牙，加纳，乌拉圭，韩国

世界杯31支参赛队伍由各个洲世界杯预选赛选出，其中欧洲拥有13个参赛名额，非洲5个名额，亚洲4.5个名额，南美洲4.5个名额，北美及加勒比地区3.5个名额和大洋洲0.5个名额。其中的半个名额是附加赛名额，澳大利亚和哥斯达黎加通过附加赛获得世界杯参赛资格。东道主卡塔尔自动获得参赛资格。
世界杯遵循杯赛赛制，分为小组赛和淘汰赛，与欧冠、亚冠等冠军联赛不同，世界杯小组赛为单回合制，每支队伍踢3场小组赛，积分前2名晋级淘汰赛。淘汰赛不再抽签，A组第一对阵B组第二，B组第一对阵A组第二，C组第一对阵D组第二，D组第一对阵C组第二，以此类推，同时，小组前二的两支队伍将分在上下两个半区，保证决赛前不再相遇。

10 月的国庆小长假刚一结束，准备告诫学生们及时收心、恢复学习状态的长篇大论还没来得及打好腹稿，便伴随着疫情的到来再没机会说出口。小长假结束到校第二天，我所在的城市便由于疫情不得不陆续发出居家线上学习的通知，原本以为一周就能结束的线上学习，一晃眼已经进行了整整 5 周，在这 5 周里，我已经习惯了每天起床一杯咖啡后直接坐到桌前，开始一天的线上课程准备。
教师线下如何授课
在介绍我的线上授课经验之前，有必要先对我当前线下授课的方式进行简单介绍，我所在的小学使用的硬件设备是希沃白板，日常完成备课后，我会到教室使用希沃白板打开 PPT 进行授课。希沃白板的便利之处在于，即便你不使用内置的同名应用「希沃白板」进行备课、授课，它仍然支持打开课件后，直接在课件上使用不同颜色的画笔进行标记、圈画，并支持橡皮擦功能，大大节省了备课时间。
此外，希沃白板通常会配备有投影仪，一般我会在习题讲评课上利用投影仪播放练习单或是课堂作业，来完成习题讲评课；或是在随堂课上实时对学生的作业、作品进行展示。希沃白板还内置了多种工具，我使用频率较高的是其内置的倒计时功能，当课堂上需要进行限时练习或讨论时，它便能派上用场。
居家授课如何复制线下经验
我手上的电脑设备一共有两台，对于使用 Windows 电脑的用户而言，在电脑上直接下载前文提到过的「希沃白板」应用，便能把制作好的课件直接导入希沃（或直接利用希沃制作课件）实现实时圈画、倒计时等常用功能。而我的 Windows 电脑借给了同样有网课需求的同事，因此我可以用来上网课的主要设备就是一台 16+256G 的 …]]></summary>

本文提供了一个使用 iPad 进行数字阅读的低成本实用方案。
使用数字工具建立工作流基本上都遵循「收集-整理-阅读-输出」这样一个基本流程。在少数派上已经有很多文章关注了获取信息、收集整理、笔记输出等方面的方法论，但似乎比较少有人专门关注「阅读」这件事情。
阅读好像是一项不言自明、人人具备的技能，但是在数字时代，如何打造自己的数字阅读方案仍然是一个值得讨论的问题。虽然数字设备摆脱了纸质材料笨重的束缚，提供了更多的内容信息来源，但是也带来了新的难题。电脑、平板、手机……什么才是更好的阅读设备？书籍、报刊杂志、网页、社交媒体信息，如何更好的整合多源信息？
我认为，一个好的数字阅读方案应当满足以下要求：

简洁实用、舒适方便，专注于阅读本身；
提供一体化的阅读平台，既能广泛容纳各类来源、形式的内容，又能方便地记录标注笔记，对接后续内容输出；
成本较低，能够为更多人所用。

围绕这些目标，这篇文章介绍了我是如何从自己的需求出发，尝试用 iPad 打造适合自己的阅读工具的，希望能够给大家提供一些参考。
关于数字阅读：我需要什么样的工具
选择有效的工具必须先明确自己的需求。作为一个社科博士研究生以及数字工具的爱好者，我的日常阅读内容与来源大致包括这几个方面：

与个人研究议题相关的中英学术书籍、论文以及报告；
其他书籍，包括人文社科经典、人物传记、非虚构类作品、小说等；
专业媒体与官方资讯，个人关注的信源如财新、晚点、联合早报、澎湃、各类官媒等；
其他互联网信息，来自微信、微博等社交媒体以及其他网站。

在过去，我的阅读方式大致是这样的：…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[什么是合格的PPT？
我们做演示幻灯片（后用PPT指代）最好的结果是什么？就是让自己想要传达的目标与听众期待的目标尽量匹配，如何能达成这效果，那就能说这样PPT是合格的。

 
我们拿可以称之为每年“年度最佳PPT”的苹果发布会举例，苹果想要传达的是“我们又创造了一些NB的产品，快来买!"，而用户期待的是“今年又会拿什么让人惊叹的产品跟功能出来震撼到我”，苹果为了传达产品的厉害之处，会用大大的数字突出性能提升百分比，会通过一个个实际使用场景来说明新功能能够帮助用户解决痛点，会通过层层递进的方式，让爆点越来越大，惊喜接踵而来……通过一系列的手段来满足用户的期待，通过发布会让新产品特性，深刻的传达到用户脑中。

 
说完了飘在天上的，再来说些更加接地气的，例如打工人每年必须要做的年终总结PPT。
年终总结大部分人的目标应该是“快看我今年干了好多好多的事，没闲着，给我多点年终奖”，很多初入职场的打工人会把做过的所有事情堆进PPT中，来个十几页，希望领导看到，“我今年都干了这么多事情了，没有功劳也有苦劳吧”，但是这样的PPT不是领导所期望的。

领导其实期望看到的是“你为今年的目标做了什么，有什么成长，明年如何达成目标”，归根到底就是要表现出你这个人如何，有没有潜力，值不值得被激励。还有你的领导也需要对上汇报，你报告里的部分内容将会成为他的汇报内容，他要达成的汇报目标是“今年目标我们团队是这样达成的，整个团队在成长，明年我们将会达成更高的目标”，他要表现出自己是一个合格的团队领导，能够带领团队完成目标，他也希望拿到更多的年终奖或者升职。
看完上面的分析，我想你应该清楚一个合格的年终总结PPT应该怎么做了吧，多写自己是如何的优秀，如何帮助完成了团队年终目标，自己的成长以及明年的计划，对于一些与团队目标关系不大的工作，可以简单带过。
大而广之，其实做任何内容输出，都不要脱离或者偏离自己…]]></summary>
