Forza Horizon 5 players now have access to in-game ray tracing and DLSS or FSR upscaling support on PC. The latest series 14 “Donut Media” update arrived yesterday, and it now allows Forza Horizon 5 players to enable ray tracing in free roam areas and races at ultra or extreme settings.
You’ll need a powerful PC to play with 4K extreme settings, but Playground Games has also added in Nvidia’s DLSS upscaling technology alongside AMD’s very latest FSR 2.2 support. Both upscaling technologies will take a 1080p image and upscale it to 4K, improving the performance in Forza Horizon 5.

微软提交了一个一百多行的补丁，使 Linux 内核可以在嵌套的微软虚拟化管理程序（MSHV）下运行，即可以在 Hyper-V 虚拟机中运行 Hyper-V 虚拟机。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：你真的需要在套娃运行 Linux 吗？你可以试试。




能打败顶尖的围棋 AI 却会输给业余选手

自从 AlphaGo 使用神经网络而通过自我对弈精通围棋后，人类就一败涂地了。研究人员创建了一个对抗性的围棋程序，使用一些超乎常规的下法训练，它在与业余棋手的对弈中败北，但是却可以打败一个顶尖的开源围棋 AI KataGo。KataGo 使用数百万次自我对弈学习围棋，但这仍然不足以覆盖所有可能的情况，留下了可利用的漏洞。研究显示，达到人类水平的 AI 往往会犯一些非常奇怪的错误，以让人类感到惊讶的方式失败。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：不按套路出牌，连 AI 都受不了。




Linux 内核中出现一个丑陋的“黑科技”

安全研究人员在 Linux 主线内核中发现了一个已经存在三年的“黑科技”：Linux 内核会识别以 “X” 字母开始的进程，并返回“不支持原子模式设置”的错误。这个丑陋的“黑科技”是为了解决旧版本的 X.Org 服务器中的一个错误。但由于没有人愿意再维护 X11，于是这个补丁的提交者觉得，与其修复有问题的代码，不如调整内核以绕开。但事实上这只是检查第一个字母是否是 “X”，扩大了打击面，因为不是所有以 “X” 开头的进程都是 X.Org 的进程。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这样丑陋的代码显然会被 Linus 破口大骂的，不知道怎么悄悄潜入到内核当中的。]]></summary>

Imgbb
postimage


Believe me... it's very easy, just you have to be carefull when you are getting image urls after hosting. So, follow me for getting correct links:
Imgbb hosting:
Step-1: Go to imgbb
Step-2: Click to create account

Step-3: You can create account with email & password. Or using any social account. I am signing in with my gmail.

Step-4: After sign in you will get a page like this & then click create new album.

Step-5: Now you will have a modal asking some info. Fill these info according to your need & save it. So, you will have a new album to manage your images for the current project. [You can upload images & host without creating album. But creating album is more organized for your work. Right?]

Step-6: Click upload images & give the images you want to host.

Step-7: After uploading image quickly you will have this page.
upload.

Step-8: In a short time, your upload will be completed. The imgbb will provide you the viewer links of images. 

But if you add these links in your project as image source, then you will have error & images will not load. So, you have to choose direct links from the dropdown list.

Once you choose direct links, you will have image links like these (links with image extension .jpg/ .png etc. at the last)

Hurray!! Now use these links in your image source. It will surely work.

=============================

postimages. These process for hosting here almost similar like imgbb. But you can resize you images from here. You will have fun!! I am giving images of steps serially.








So... now? Start your project task.😊😊😊😊😊]]></summary>

Awesome is a window manager for the Linux desktop. A "window manager" is a graphical interface that primarily (if not literally) just manages the drawing and arrangement of windows. In practice, even the most rudimentary of window managers actually provides a little more than just the ability to draw a window. Most also provide a pop-up menu so you can launch an application, some provide a dock or panel so you can switch between different applications you have running. They stop short at providing desktop conveniences such as drawing a wallpaper in the background of your screen, mounting and unmounting devices, providing a system tray, and so on. A window manager assumes you can us…]]></summary>

It's been a lot of fun, and the Pi has been a great platform for the students and me. We've used Code with Mu and it's been quite successful. Our aptitude with Python has grown with experience, and so recently I started looking for ways to offer these students more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A common source of confusion when using Git is not knowing what it all means when you see an output like this:
You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make 
experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any 
commits you make in thisstate without impacting any branches 
by switching back to a branch.

To really understand what is happening, we need to look inside Git.
Git commits are immutable—meaning you can create new ones, but what’s already inside will never be changed. This is how our repository keeps data safe for us. The only way of making changes to the repository is by creating new commits.
Git commits gives us a stable, complete history of the changes to the repository. On top of this stable base, we have a dynamic part: branches. What can be surprising …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用了一年多，也算是初期用户了。Fluent Search 在开发者的疯狂更新下，距离 1.0 还是遥遥无期。

Fluent Search 是什么
没错，又是一款搜索软件。但它有着比同类软件更好的颜值，更丰富的功能，同时也带来更多的不稳定性。

Fluent Search 官网，不建议安装微软商店版，功能会受限
仅支持 Windows 10/11

优缺点（个人观点）
优点：

颜值（ Windows 下应该没有对手 ）
任务：低配版插件
多屏支持，让搜索窗口出现在你想要的地方
快捷键支持 Win  Ctrl + Ctrl Alt + Alt
nightly 的更新频率接近 nightly ，最近降频了
预览：
文件、目录：部分文档可以直接编辑，图片、音视频
网页：方便临时打开网页，可以指定 PC 样式或移动端样式

辅助功能：虽然个人用不上，但有还有挺好的，特殊人群也需要提高效率

缺点：

选择搜索结果不太方便，不支持通过 Ctrl\Alt + 数字 来选择，键盘导航 这种替代品也不太好用
没有 使用管理员权限运行 的开关，需要手动操作一波
稳定性仍有欠缺，但基本可用
插件不多，虽然部分可由任务流代替

始于颜值

颜值就是生产力，但在 Windows 上讲动画还是算了。

热衷于新事物的我在 Windows 11 刚出来时就冲了，使用一段时间后发现 Listary 有兼容性问题，作者断更，无法正常使用，于是开始寻找解决方案。期间尝试使用过 uTools、Wox、ueli、Flow launch , 发现还是 Listary 顺手，只能先凑合着。直到某一天我在一个犄角旮旯中发现了 Fluent Search ，虽然同样不如 Listary 顺滑，但颜值在一众软件中脱颖而出，就它了。
外观、动画、自定义
设置位置：外观、特效、设置、主页
从颜色到窗口，从字体到信息，都可…]]></summary>

又到双十一购物节，说来有趣，每年双十一我都会关注羽绒服这一品类，原因大概是冬天即将到来，我隐约有添购衣服的担忧，可又因为此时我还身穿短袖，买羽绒服有种错季购物的感觉，在将羽绒服加入购物车后往往又放弃下单。于是这些年，每到双十一，我的购物车里的羽绒服更新一次，羽绒服照片成了淘宝的皮肤挂件，年年换新。
我当然是有买羽绒服，但往往不是购物车里那件，我在淘宝上浏览的是万元左右的始祖鸟、Moncler、加拿大鹅，加入购物车里的是两千元左右的北面，但最终购买的是千元以内的波司登和优衣库轻薄款，哦对了，还有老家线下店铺的以纯羽绒服。
不过长期以往，我倒是对羽绒服有了足够多的了解，足以写下这篇有参考价值的文章，帮助人们选购羽绒服。
羽绒服的历史
人类自古以来就有利用动物皮毛御寒的历史，早在原始社会时期，人类祖先就已经初步掌握了将兽皮制作成衣物的方法，用兽皮和树叶蔽体防寒，后来逐渐出现麻、棉、丝等纺织物，人类衣物变得丰富。相对来说，人类利用禽类羽毛御寒的历史要短得多，在唐朝，人们用鹅绒和布混合填充在被子中，在十三四世纪的欧洲，人们用鸭和鹅的羽毛填充进被套中。
直到 1940 年，现代羽绒服才被发明出来，主角是美国的艾迪·鲍尔，作为一名狂热户外运动爱好者，他在一次户外钓鱼过程中差点冻死，于是决心制作一件真正保暖的外套。鲍尔找到了鹅毛的羽绒，又恰逢杜邦实验室在 1938 年发明了尼龙，尼龙织物质地紧密，与棉布相比，尼龙面料可以防止羽绒「钻绒」，于是，他将二者结合，把羽绒填充进尼龙面料的衣服，绗缝锁绒，并将第一件羽绒外套命名为「Skyliner」，申…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[awk 和 Groovy 相辅相成，可以创建强大、有用的脚本。


最近我写了一个使用 Groovy 脚本来清理我的音乐文件中的标签的系列。我开发了一个 框架，可以识别我的音乐目录的结构，并使用它来遍历音乐文件。在该系列的最后一篇文章中，我从框架中分离出一个实用类，我的脚本可以用它来处理文件。

这个独立的框架让我想起了很多 awk 的工作方式。对于那些不熟悉 awk 的人来说，你学习下这本电子书：


《awk 实用指南》


我从 1984 年开始大量使用 awk，当时我们的小公司买了第一台“真正的”计算机，它运行的是 System V Unix。对我来说，awk 是非常完美的：它有关联内存associative memory——将数组视为由字符串而不是数字来索引的。它内置了正则表达式，似乎专为处理数据而生，尤其是在处理数据列时，而且结构紧凑，易于学习。最后，它非常适合在 Unix 工作流使用，从标准输入或文件中读取数据并写入到输出，数据不需要经过其他的转换就出现在了输入流中。

说 awk 是我日常计算工具箱中的一个重要部分一点也不为过。然而，在我使用 awk 的过程中，有几件事让我感到不满意。

可能主要的问题是 awk 善于处理以分隔字段呈现的数据，但很奇怪它不善于处理 CSV 文件，因为 CSV 文件的字段被引号包围时可以嵌入逗号分隔符。另外，自 awk 发明以来，正则表达式已经有了很大的发展，我们需要记住两套正则表达式的语法规则，而这并不利于编写无 bug 的代码。一套这样的规则已经很糟糕了。

由于 awk 是一门简洁的语言，因此它缺少很多我认为有用的东西，比如更丰富的基础类型、结构体、switch 语句等等。

相比之下，Groovy 拥有这些能力：可以使用 OpenCSV 库，它很擅长处理 CSV 文件、Java 正则表达式和强大的…]]></summary>

Elon Musk has sold another $3.4 billion in Tesla shares, according to a series of forms filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today. Musk has offloaded almost $20 billion in Tesla shares this year, mostly to finance his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter.
Musk sold $8.4 billion in shares in April and another $6.9 billion in August. After his sales in April, he tweeted, “No further TSLA sales planned after today.” Then after the sales in August, he again said that he was done selling, and that those shares were offloaded in case he had to buy Twitter — at the time, he was embroiled in a lawsuit for attempting to back out of the deal.
Twitter has been struggling. Some major advertisers have paused spending on Twitter because of...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[打算为你的项目开发工作安装 Python 3.11？下面是如何在 Ubuntu 等发行版中安装 Python 3.11 的方法。




Python 3.11 于 2022 年 10 月 25 日发布，并声称比之前的 Python 3.10 版本快 10% - 60%。

一如既往，3.11 中的功能和改进列表明显较多。下面是一个简介：


错误回溯更明确，可以指出导致错误的确切语句。

引入异常组和新的 except* 语法。

你可以在基础表达式中添加自定义文本，以便在你的代码中更好地处理错误。

引入 Variadic 泛型，允许在 Python 数值库（如 NumPy）中使用类似数组的结构。

字典类型 TypedDict 得到了改进，现在你可以指定个别字典项目是必须的还是可选的。

引入了 Self 注解，允许类返回它们自己的类型实例。


还有很多，你可以在官方的 3.11 亮点页面 上详细了解。

Linux 发行版中的当前 Python 版本

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 带有 Python 3.10，而最近发布的 Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu 也是同样的版本。然而， Kinetick Kudu 可能会在几周内采用 3.11。

另外，Fedora 37 已经有了 Python 3.11 RC2，并将提供该版本。

所以，如果你正在运行 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS、Linux Mint 21 或任何基于 Ubuntu-LTS 的发行版，这里是你如何通过 PPA 安装 Python 3.11 的方法。

注意：谨慎地使用这个方法。确保你知道你在做什么，因为替换 Linux 发行版的基础 Python 版本可能会导致系统不稳定。许多默认的应用程序和软件包都依赖于 3.10 版本。

Apple is working on a brand new “Custom Accessibility Mode” for iOS, according to evidence found by 9to5Mac in the second iOS 16.2 developer beta. The company apparently says this mode offers a “customizable, streamlined way to use your iPhone and iPad,” which seems to mean you’ll be able to adjust some settings to make your iOS devices easier to use. 
With the new mode, “users will be able to set things like UI and larger text, apps available on the Home Screen, allowed contacts, and access to hardware buttons for when Custom Accessibility Mode is enabled,” 9to5Mac reports. In screenshots shared by the outlet, you can see how the mode enables things like much larger app icons, a big back button, and a simpler UI in the Messages app.

Gmail’s permanent switch that moves everyone over to a new integrated view starts this month. 
In a blog post published on Tuesday, Google announced it’s getting rid of the option to revert back to the previous Gmail UI, so we’re all just going to have to get used to the bubbly — and very blue — interface. That includes its Material Design 3 font and Google Sans Text. 


Google calls Gmail’s new layout the “integrated” view because it comes with options for Mail, Chat, Spaces, and Meet on the far-left sidebar. While hovering over these buttons reveals a small pop-out menu, clicking on them makes the app fill the whole screen.
In case you find the extra buttons distracting, you can disable Meet and Chat from your Settings menu. This saves...

Nvidia has released a cut-down version of its high-end A100 GPU as a way to get around restrictions the US government recently imposed to limit how companies can sell AI training equipment to countries like China and Russia. The card, known as the A800, should have the same massive computing capabilities as the original but can only communicate with other cards in a computing cluster at 400 gigabytes per second instead of 600Gbps. According to The Wall Street Journal, that means the A800 should be just as good for simple tasks but will be significantly less effective when it’s part of something like a supercomputer.
An unnamed Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters that the card is an “alternative product to the Nvidia A100 GPU for customers...

Nothing is more frustrating than buying a new pair of headphones, an OLED TV, or a backpack just to find out that you could have gotten it for a lot cheaper somewhere else. In order to keep customers happy — and prevent them from going elsewhere — many retailers offer price-matching policies where they promise to match a lower price you’ve found elsewhere. That’s information that could come in handy this holiday season, especially since Black Friday and Cyber Monday are once again right around the corner. 
What follows are the price-matching policies for a variety of major retailers. There are a few things to make note of here. First, all price-matching policies have a number of rules attached to them. We’ve summarized some of the rules...

Disney Plus added over 9 million subscribers in the US in the last several months, and many people in the US are opting for its bundle that includes Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus. In its earnings report on Tuesday, Disney also revealed that it added 12.1 million Disney Plus subscribers globally, making for 164 million in total, as well as 14.6 million subscribers across all its services.
Christine McCarthy, the chief financial officer at Disney, said during an earnings call that 40 percent of Disney Plus subscribers have the bundle with Hulu and ESPN Plus, which its pricing makes it increasingly hard to pass up.

现年 32 岁的 James Zhong 在 2012 年利用快存快取的方式从丝绸之路非法获取了 5 万枚比特币。他窃取的比特币当时只值 65 万美元，现在价值已超过 33 亿美元。去年 11 月，美国执法部门搜查了他的住处，查获了约 5 万枚比特币。这次扣押是当时美国司法部历史上最大的加密货币扣押。周一美国司法部宣布，James Zhong 已承认电信欺诈。

被下载了数千次的偷取密码的 Python 软件包

安全研究专家在 PyPi 上发现了 30 多个恶意 Python 软件包，试图安装 W4SP，这是一个可以从浏览器会话中偷取密码和 Cookie 的脚本。这些恶意软件包的名字听起来很普通，比如 typeutil、colorwin 等等。攻击者通常会复制一个现有的软件包，并稍作修改，以使用户错误输入时无意中安装了恶意软件。

老王点评：虽然 PyPi 已经做了一些工作，但是显然还是为恶意行为留下了广阔空间。




微软在 Windows 11 的注销菜单中显示广告

根据用户反馈的截图，微软在 Windows 11 的注销菜单中宣传其 OneDrive 文件托管服务，并提示用户创建或完成他们的微软账户。不过，看起来这可能只是针对特定群体的 A/B 测试。微软以前也在文件资源管理器、开始菜单等处发布过各种广告。

老王点评：不管是微软还是 Canonical，似乎都把用户安装的操作系统当成了自家的广告牌。问题是，这是谁赋予的权利？]]></summary>

Having just switched work laptops last December, I realized how much I love applying stickers to my work machines. Sometimes the stickers are souvenirs from past events, others are from projects that I am passionate about, and some are just for fun!
Curious to know what others had on their laptops, I asked!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[有关 Xfce 4.18 的核心和原生应用程序的功能的全面介绍。


经过近两年的开发，Xfce 4.18 将在 2022 年圣诞节期间发布。作为 Xfce 4.16 以来的重要的版本，其一直在开发标签 4.17 下进行开发，以增强这个轻量级桌面。

考虑到 GTK4 的更新、初步的 Wayland 支持，以及核心和本地应用程序的改进，Xfce 4.18 是一个重要的里程碑版本，其带来了大量更新。

从发布时间来看，第一个 Xfce 4.18 预发布版（pre1）已经发布。2022 年 12 月的第一周会有另一个预发布版。而 Xfce 4.18 的最终版本预计将在 2022 年 12 月 15 日至 12 月 29 日之间发布。

由于目前还没有官方的详细介绍，我在这篇文章中总结了 Xfce 4.18 的基本和主要功能。

请继续阅读。



Xfce 4.18 的新功能

1、核心库更新

Xfce 4.18 的依赖关系有所改变，并使用以下版本进行编译：


glib-2.0 >= 2.66

gtk >= 3.24

libcairo >= 1.16

gdk-pixbuf-2.0 >= 2.40

gobject-introspection >= 1.66


2、桌面和面板

顶部的主面板带来了新的设置和调整。但整体外观仍与以前的 4.16 版本中的一样。一些默认的面板小程序在这个版本中也有变化。桌面图标、右键上下文菜单和项目保持不变。

面板的首选项设置有两个新的选项。首先，面板的长度现在以像素设置，而不是百分比。其次，一个新的选项，“保持面板在窗口上方Keep panel above windows” ，可以让你将窗口对话放到面板后面。之前，应用程序的窗口只能达到面板的边缘。



彻底修改了时钟小程序的设置。是的，你…]]></summary>

作为红帽的用户体验（UX）设计和 Ansible 产品团队的交互设计师，我们花了大约 6 个月的时间为 Ansible 社区设计了一系列徽标。这件事其实在更早的时候就开始了，当时一位项目经理要求我们为一个幻灯片提供一个 “快速而简单” 的徽标。在收集了一些需求后，我们在几天内就向相关人员展示了一个徽标，而且没有经过太多调整。几个月后，另一个相关人员说他们也需要类似的徽标，所以我们重复了这个过程。

于是，我们注意到一个模式：像这样的徽标资源不仅仅代表个人的要求，而是整个 Ansible 项目的共同需要。在完成了几个徽标要求后，我们有了一系列临时的设计，但在没有意识到品牌和设计惯例的情况下，这可能给整个 Ansible 的品牌视觉造成了不一致。随着这个徽标系列的增加，我们认识到了这个迫在眉睫的问题，并需要解决它。

我们的解决方案是创建一个 Ansible 设计系统，这是一个针对品牌的资源，可以指导未来一致的徽标设计。

什么是设计系统？

设计系统是一个可重复使用的资源和指导方法的集合，有助于告知任何数字产品套件的视觉语言。设计系统创造了一些模式，将独立的产品整合在一起，并通过可扩展性和一致性提升品牌。

特别是在一个有多种产品的大公司里，如果没有标准化，扩展起来就不容易，因为不同的团队对每个产品都有贡献。设计系统可以作为每个团队建立新资产的基线。有了标准化的外观和感觉，产品在整个组合中被统一为一个家族。

从头构建一个设计系统

在收到相关人员提出的为 Ansible 开源社区（如 Ansible Builder、Ansible Runner 和Project Receptor）创建徽标的一系列要求后，我们决定为我们的工作流程设计一个结构，并创建一个单一…]]></summary>

        <id>https://linux.cn/article-15226-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</id>
        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15226-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-11-08T03:06:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本指南旨在帮助你在 Firefox、Chrome、Chromium 和 Edge 等流行的网页浏览器中启用深色模式。


我们都喜欢深色模式。与标准浅色模式相比，许多人更喜欢它。许多桌面应用原生提供深色模式，而一些应用则是通过桌面环境的底层模式适应深色模式。

不可否认，我们都在网页浏览器上花费了很多时间。我们很少使用桌面应用（除非你从事专门的工作，例如视频编辑等）。因此，当你花费大量时间在浏览器中阅读和学习时，你始终可以选择深色模式。不过，对于网页浏览器，启用深色模式的方法略有不同。

本指南为你提供了在 Firefox、Chromium、Chrome 和 Edge 浏览器中启用深色模式的简单步骤。

在网页浏览器中启用深色模式

在 Firefox 中启用深色模式

打开 Firefox 并点击右上角的菜单。

单击 “设置Settings > 扩展和主题Extension and Themes”。

选择 “深色主题Dark Theme” 并点击 “启用enable”。你应该会看到深色模式已应用于 Firefox。



在 Firefox 浏览器中启用深色模式



深色模式下的 Firefox

要将其还原，请按照相同的步骤并选择浅色主题。

Chromium 和 Chrome 中的深色模式

默认情况下，Chromium 或 Chrome 不会预安装任何深色主题。因此，你需要前往 Chrome 应用商店并下载你想要的深色主题。对于本指南，我会推荐超过一百万用户使用的 “Morpheon Dark” 主题。

从 Chromium 浏览器打开 Morpheon Dark 主题页面（以下链接）。


Chrome 应用商店中的 Morpheon Dark 主题


点击 “添加到 ChromeAdd To Chrome” 按钮。它应该会在 Chrome 中启用。

你可能想探索 Chrome 应用店中提供的其他深色或浅色主题。 访问此页面获取所有深色主题的集合。

但是，你应该要记住的一件事是：此主题不会更改设置或上下文菜单，这是显而易见的。因为它只是改变了浏览器窗口，而这些菜单（有时）是操作系统本身的一部分。



Chromium 深色主题

对 Chrome 浏览器也遵循相同的步骤。

Edge 浏览器 – 深色模式

但是，Edge 浏览器 默认带有更好的深色主题。它允许你从设置中使用 GTK+、浅色和深色模式。

打开 Edge 浏览器，点击右上角的三个小点。

转到 “外观Appearance” 并选择 “深色Dark”。这样应该就好了。

Edge 的这种深色主题实现更好，因为它改变了上下文菜单和地址栏。



深色主题的 Edge

总结

如果你是高级用户，你可能不需要本指南。你可以自己弄清楚。

但我们为所有读者涵盖了所有基础到高级教程。许多新的 Linux 用户可能不知道如何在浏览器中启用深色模式。

所以，就是说，我希望这对你和其他人有帮助。如果你遇到任何问题，请在下面的评论框中告诉我。

前言
毋庸置疑，如今的 Chrome 及其他基于 Chromium 的 Blink 内核浏览器因其速度快、网页兼容性好的优点，以绝对的优势占据了浏览器市场的主导地位。但与此同时，因为 Chrome 与 Chromium 被一家号称「不作恶」但处处作恶的公司所拥有，所以经常被诟病存在隐私问题。许多想要逃离 Chrome 统治的人都转向了更加自由的 Firefox 浏览器，尽管其母公司 Mozilla 近年来也是骚操作不断，但 Firefox 仍然是除 Chromium 的 Blink 和 Safari 的 WebKit 外唯一选择。
我曾经也很喜欢用 Chrome（或者说是 Chromium），使用 ArchLinux 作为主力系统的我，官方软件源中使用开源 Chromium 代码编译出的 Chromium 浏览器在当时体验基本与谷歌官方的闭源 Chrome 一致。促使我转向使用 Firefox 的契机开始于一年多前，谷歌限制了第三方浏览器对其数据同步 API 的使用，这样一来各家发行版自行编译的 Chromium 浏览器都失去了账户同步功能，这在当时引起了很多不满。从那时开始，我就开始尝试使用 Firefox 替代 Chromium 作为我的主力浏览器，并最终彻底淘汰掉了 Chromium。
无独有偶，谷歌又宣布将会在 2022 年底彻底禁用 Manifest V2 规范（后来又推迟了半年），作为替代者的 Manifest V3 规范，用谷歌的话说是为了「保护用户隐私」，限制了浏览器扩展的很多权限，其中影响最大的是禁用了 We…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[systemd 252 如预期的锁定了 Linux 引导过程

之前，我们 报道 过，systemd 创始人发文指出 Linux 引导过程不安全，并提出采用加密签名的统一内核镜像（UKI），使用 TPM 2.0 硬件加强 Linux 系统启动过程的安全性。UKI 将 Linux 内核和 initrd，以及一些其他的小组件，合并到一个文件中，允许整个文件被加密签名。在刚刚发布的 systemd 252 中，几个重要的功能都与新的 UKI 全签名启动过程有关。除此以外，还很一些重要特性也值得关注。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：我是觉得 sytemd 有些激进了，虽然确实 systemd 在引入新特性方面进展很快。




Mastodon 用户激增

在埃隆·马斯克接管 Twitter 的一周内，Mastodon 激增了 23 万名用户，月活用户已达 65 万。但与 Twitter 相比，仍然非常少，Twitter 有将近 “2.38 亿日活用户”。其创始人说，“它显然没有 Twitter 那么大，但它是这个网络有史以来最大的。”Mastodon 出现于 2016 年，可以免费使用，也没有广告，由一个非营利组织开发的，并通过众筹获得支持。


消息来源：CNN



老王点评：没用过，也不知道是啥。




Arc 显卡的更新只能在支持英特尔 ME 的系统进行

英特尔管理引擎（ME）是隐藏在英特尔 CPU 中的一个操作系统，它是一个修改版的 MINIX 3，运行在用户根本接触不到的 -3 层。这个事情我们以前 介绍 过。根据 Fwupd 开发者的消息，至少现在，英特尔的 Arc 显卡只能通过 ME 来更新其图形系统控制器的固件。因此，旧的英特尔系统或非英特尔系统，如 AMD、RISC-V 等系统，将无法更新 Arc 显卡的固件。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这显然是越来越封闭了。从最近的一些趋势来看，一些硬件厂商看似开放，其实本质上还是想各种办法封闭起来。]]></summary>

Katie Edwards
Mon, 11/07/2022 - 03:00

            
So you want (or need) to figure out what "open source" really means. I'll cover the basics of open source, whether you're interested in contributing to a project or want to be in the loop at a new job where the term keeps getting thrown around.
Full disclosure: I am a person with little technical experience, working in the content-design fringes of a very technical open source environment. Given my background in marketing and communication, I felt like a fish out of water when I made this career switch. Git, data science, the ins and outs of software… It was, and still is a year later, a lot to comprehend.
But that's why I'm writing this piece. I want to help make open source…]]></summary>

Vely combines high performance and the low footprint of C with the ease of use and improved safety of languages like PHP. It's free and open source software, licensed under GPLv3 and LGPL 3 for libraries, so you can even build commercial software with it.
Using Vely for SaaS
You can use Vely to create a multitenant web application that you can run on the Internet as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Each user has a completely separate data space from any other.
In this example web application, a user can sign up for a notebook service to create notes and then view and delete them. It demonstrates several technology integrations in just 310 lines of code across seven source files. The technologies incl…]]></summary>

前几天看了「赛博朋克：边缘行者」，觉得里面的拖影效果非常有趣，就在 app 里做了一下。

App 介绍：
CUBE 是一款结合 iOS 软硬件新特性来完成实时特效的 app ，希望大家在手机上就可以玩到有趣的特效。 以我看过的热门影音作品为灵感，已经完成下面三个主要特效：
LiDAR 扫描效果：
日本女团 Perfume 在 Flow 的 MV 中大量使用点云这种技术，而正好配备 LiDAR 的 iPhone 可以感知深度，生成点云。
 
采样实时图像与 LiDAR 扫描仪生成的深度图，生成 3D 粒子（点云）。至多可生成 3,000,000 个粒子。
将生成的 3D 粒子与现实世界的场景混合在一起，让你感觉身处超现实世界。

Matrix 效果：
之前 黑客帝国 4 上映，黑客帝国又变成热门话题，就很想复刻一下经典的 code rain 。
 
这一次会选蓝色药丸还是红色药丸？

液态金属效果：
 
既然都提到了黑客帝国，那么终结者也不能不提。贯穿全系列的液态金属杀手也是经典之一。CUBE 带你回到 1991 年，化身成为詹姆斯·卡梅隆所拍摄的电影「终结者 2：审判日」中的终结者 T-1000 。

App Store
 
兑换码：
如果你对上面三个特效感兴趣，你可以在这里找到兑换码。
（我把码都放到一个 notion page 里，可以回复用掉的兑换码编号，方便我编辑。）

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你上次更新通过 Pip 安装的 Python 软件包是什么时候？大多数用户往往会忘记这些 Python 软件包也需要手动更新，因为仅仅更新系统存储库对于软件包来说是不起作用的。

因此，让我们花点时间看看如何使用 Pip，来更新旧的 Python 软件包吧。

如何使用 Pip 升级 Python 软件包

Pip（Pip Installs Packages） 是一个用于管理 Python 软件包的 命令行实用程序command line utility 。你可以将 Pip 安装 Python 软件包，类比为在 Ubuntu 和 Debian 中使用 apt 管理软件包那样。

因此，接下来就让我们深入了解如何使用这个极好的工具 Pip，来管理与 Python 软件包相关的内容吧。

1、列出过时的 Python 软件包

在计划更新什么软件包之前，我们先要列出有哪些过时的软件包，你可以在其中选择想要更新的软件包，因为大多数人不会想一下子更新整个软件包库。

要列出过时的 Python 软件包，你只需将 pip 命令与 list 选项、--outdated 标志一同使用即可，如下图所示：

pip list --outdated




2、升级特定的软件包

获得可更新的软件包列表后，你可以像我之前提到的那样，选择你要更新的那个特定的软件包，pip 升级软件包命令的语法如下：

pip install package_name -U


例如，我想将名为 anime-api 的软件包升级到最新版本，所以我将使用下面的命令来升级：

pip install anime-api -U




3、将软件包升级到特定的版本

没有必要总是使用软件的最新版本，如果你想将软件包升级到不是最新的某个特定版本，参考如下的命令语法：

pip install --upgrade <package>==<version>


例如，我想将名为 xdg 的软件包更新到 5.1 版本，5.1 版本是最新版本的前一个版本，所以可以使用以下命令：

pip install --upgrade xdg==5.1




4、使用 Pip 一次性升级所有软件包

请注意：我不建议你一次性升级所以软件包，因为 Python 软件包的依赖项太复杂了，一次性的升级无法处理相互依赖项。

要一次性升级所有 python 软件包，你可以使用以下命令：

pip3 list --outdated --format=freeze | grep -v '^\-e' | cut -d = -f 1 | xargs -n1 pip3 install -U




上面的命令使用了 xargs。首先，会得到所有需要更新的软件包，然后对每个软件包执行 pip3 install -U 命令。

我在这里使用的是 pip3，而不是 pip。在 Ubuntu 22.04 及更高的版本中，pip 和 pip3 命令都可以使用。

总结

使用 Pip 一次性更新所有 Python 软件包并不是一个好主意。我发现一次性更新后，软件包之间的依赖关系被破坏了，所以请确保只更新你想要更新的软件包。

如果你还有其他的疑问，就请在评论区中留言吧。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[想知道如何在台式机或笔记本电脑上检查 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 中的 CPU 和硬盘温度？这是一个快速指南。


如果你是普通用户，那么实际上不需要检查 CPU 或 HDD 温度。但是，如果你使用的是非常旧的硬件或轻薄型的硬件，你可能会遇到过热问题。因为这些薄的硬件内部紧密耦合在一起，无论做了多少传热机制，它都会升温。因此，必须监控硬件的温度。然而，现代 Linux 发行版能够通过软件传感器很好地处理过热情况。

在 Ubuntu 上监控 CPU 和硬盘温度的步骤

使用终端

我们将使用几个包来实现相同的目的。在基于 Ubuntu 的系统中打开一个终端并安装以下内容。

sudo apt install hddtemp
sudo apt install lm-sensors


hddtemp 程序为你提供硬盘和 SSD （根据我的测试）的温度。 lm-sensors 包为你提供来自 CPU 和其他通过 PCI 端口访问的传感器的温度详细信息。

安装后，从终端运行以下命令。你需要知道你的磁盘标识符，例如 /dev/sda 或 /dev/sdb 等。

要找出磁盘标识符，你可以使用 fdisk。

sudo fdisk -l


然后运行以下命令检查 HDD 或 SSD 温度。

sudo hddtemp




来自终端的 HDD 或 SSD 温度

检查 CPU 温度和其他信息需要额外的步骤。

首先，运行以下命令，以便传感器程序可以检测到系统中的传感器。

sudo sensors-detect


上面的命令可能会问你一些是/否的问题。继续按回车选择默认选项。

完成后，运行以下命令查看 CPU 和其他接口温度。

sensors




使用传感器

使用 GUI 工具

如果你更喜欢能完成上述所有操作的漂亮 GUI，你可以安装 psensor。该程序适用于 Linux 系统，例如 Ubuntu、Fedora、Arch 和其他变体。它为你提供了漂亮的图形和表格视图：

Ubuntu 及其衍生版：

sudo apt install psensor


Fedora 和基于 RPM 的衍生版：

sudo dnf install psensor


Arch、Manjaro 和类似的衍生版：

pacman -S psensor


安装后，从终端运行 psensor 或从应用菜单启动它。

正如你在下面的截图中所见，它通过漂亮的图表让你可以很好地了解 CPU、GPU 和 HDD 的所有重要温度。使用它的首选项，你可以根据需要对其进行调整。这个轻量级的程序在很多情况下都会很有帮助。



psensor 运行

因此，这些是你可以在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 系统中监控 CPU、GPU 或 HDD 温度的一些方法。如果你知道其他方法，请通过下面的评论栏告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如何让枯燥的读书像看剧、享受美食、打游戏一样快乐？
读书上瘾模型，让读书成为一个上瘾循环。

上学的时候我比较喜欢玩游戏，但是在图书馆有很好的学习看书的氛围，游戏玩得比较少。毕业后，不再有看书的氛围了，玩游戏的频率逐渐增加，从每周1天增加到2天、后来逐步增加到7天，每天都玩游戏。
那个时候我意识到已经游戏上瘾了，打游戏占据了太多的时间，所以决定戒掉游戏，经过几次尝试，终于在2020年把游戏戒掉了。

即从游戏上瘾转变为读书上瘾，读书包括输入和输出两个步骤。输入指的是看书，从去年开始在豆瓣记录读书情况，利用周末和工作日的被动等待时间，每个月最多读过11本书。
输出分为写、说、实践3种形式。

写，发表长篇博客或简短的书评。
说，分为线上和线下两种形式，线上指在各个自媒体平台发布读书视频；线下指面对面形式，1对1的交流沟通或1对多的分享。
实践，看书不应该只停留在改变认知的程度，还要实践、改变自己的行为习惯。比如看了一本关于运动的书，不仅要有每天都运动的认知，还要付诸于每天的实践行动。

上一次玩游戏是在2020年，接下来详细介绍如何从游戏上瘾转变为读书上瘾。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文仅代表个人观点，用于记录和观望一些键帽。

PBTFANS KABUKI-CHO 歌舞伎町
2022.4 
IC Base
这套键帽是由设计师OAY （罗马音？大概能翻译成哦呀，语气词）设计的第二套键帽，此前他还设计过pbtfans的深海来客，感兴趣的可以看我之前盘点的蓝色系键帽。
这套歌舞伎町键帽，灵感来源于日本的歌舞伎町——东京的娱乐中心之一。电影院、电玩舞厅、酒吧等等，从深夜到黎明，也是为数不多的大型红灯区，我对于歌舞伎町最深刻的印象则是来自于《银魂》中主角团所居住的歌舞伎町一条街。
配色：

这次的配色非常丰富，主要还是由于个性部分选用多种不同色彩。键帽整体底色以深蓝暗色调为主，而字符和个性选用明亮的色调，如同霓虹灯招牌的颜色，侧面烘托出歌舞伎町“不眠之街”的名号，到深夜依然灯火通明、灯红酒绿。
个性部分：
大货版本
这次的现货销售是直接将个性和base进行了捆绑，还包含了四个颜色的盖帽。
个性部分主要由歌舞伎、酒精和没事组成，以及歌舞伎町的招牌和著名的“一丁目”。颜色上也是选择非常丰富，盖帽倒是提供了一种略微复古但俏皮的感觉，七字回车则是意味着现代的电力为这般灯红酒绿提供了便利。
搭配展示：
该键帽已经开售有一段时间，所以已经有玩家提供了实拍的照片，有这些实物图，能更好的帮助我们来判断是否购入。

键帽信息：
材质：PBT材质
高度：原厂高度
工艺：二色工艺
厂商：PBTFANS
淘宝有售卖，据悉歌舞伎町卖的很好，货量有限，kbd自己的店铺已经卖完了，经销商仍有现货。 
个人评分:7-8（深色键帽非常耐看，歌舞伎町的主题也很新鲜，个性颜色丰富,PBTFANS代工水平不错）
购买建议：喜欢这个主题的值得入手，现货也无需等待

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
仔细翻了翻我个人的钢笔产品分享，和大家讨论过的都是以著名品牌的钢笔产品为主，对于国内钢笔品牌主要还是分享英雄旗下的经典产品与创新之作，毕竟其它钢笔品牌以我个人的眼光去看，都是没有太多购买意义的产品。
对于钢笔入门我始终推荐白金preppy系列、白金小流星系列、百乐78g、凌美狩猎者这些海外品牌的平价款式。
但因为英雄的关系，国人对于暗尖结构的钢笔有着相当的偏好，并且海外知名品牌如今也没有任何纯粹的现产暗尖钢笔产品。所以如今暗尖钢笔的赛道上全是国产钢笔品牌，并且价位主战场就是十元上下的低端市场，本篇中，我在某多多以零售价格，购买了十余款销量出色的国产暗尖，文内将从暗尖钢笔的用料、设计、特点来对它们进行全面的横评对比，希望能为大家了解这些产品带来帮助。
暗尖钢笔的发源与如今价位分布

暗尖钢笔发源于人类历史上最为成功的钢笔派克51，其诞生于1939年，暨派克成立51周年，故因此得以型号命名。
派克51的暗尖结构，通过树脂包裹了笔尖，在当年革新性得提高了钢笔的气密性，并根据结构，设计了新一代的毛细供墨系统，达到了更为稳定的书写效果。
在当年，暗尖钢笔以这两点综合的超强实用性，得到了市场的一致认可，直至停产派克51累计销售4000万支，是人类历史上最为成功的系列钢笔。
之所以停产，是因为后续钢笔的气密性与供墨毛细结构材料随着现代工业不断革新，暗尖已经不再具备核心优势。
现在的暗尖钢笔从高到底个人认为是三个层次，首先是派克前年复刻了51，做了个包住明尖的假暗尖，是目前价格最高的笔款，但不怎么值得去买。其次是英雄100代表了国产暗尖金笔，曾经100多元的价格性价比非常好，如今价格普遍要200以上，还是可以买，但没曾经的极致性价比了；最后就是本篇讲的10元上下，国产的钢尖暗尖钢笔！

CFE-A卡是索尼从A7S3开始使用的新一代高速存储设备，以应对越来越大的视频录制码率。早先使用CFE-A卡的机型都比较贵（A7S3,FX3,A1等），受众并不多。但从A7M4的大卖和FX30的发布，越来越多的用户开始使用支持CFE-A卡的相机，如何选购一张合适的CFE-A卡就成了许多用户头疼的问题。
懂数码的都知道，索尼虽然“爱好广泛”，但唯独没有生产研发存储产品的业务，也就是说索尼的卡都是其他厂家代工的贴牌产品，理论上是不可能干得过拥有独立生产研发存储颗粒的品牌的，所谓的索尼大法黑科技在存储领域也仅仅是索尼粉丝自己加上的滤镜而已。
由于CFE-A卡是索尼独占的新卡型，在发布之初的相当长一段时间里都只有索尼原厂的卡可以选择，因为缺少比较的竞品，让许多人养成了原厂=最好的固有印象。
如今第三方的CFE-A品牌越来越多，索尼原厂卡到底是个什么水平，终于可以有一个正经的横向比较了。
市面上可以做CFE-A卡的品牌有索尼，雷克沙，天硕，和至誉科技四家，笔者手里正好分别有一张拿来比较测试，他们是

索尼原厂的80G，官方售价699;
分别是雷克沙的320G，官方售价5599带读卡器;
天硕的80G，官方售价399；
至誉科技的120G，官方售价1599;

少数派不让带货就不放链接了。

之所以价格区间跨度很大，从几百到几千，主要是为了照顾不同经济实力的用户。
测试采用的读卡器是雷克沙的RW530，是一个CFA和SD卡双卡槽的读卡器，采用USB 3.2gen2接口，两个卡槽可以同时工作，可以实现互拷的功能。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[作为一名iPhone用户，快捷指令是系统中我觉得很有趣但实际上用得不是很多的应用。
最初对快捷指令的理解仅限于将多个操作步骤简化成一个，最直观的应用就是在功能日益繁杂的APP中实现功能的一键直达，比如疫情期间的健康码。
但深入探究一番后，我认为快捷指令的本质其实是打破各个APP沙盒的壁垒，实现不同应用程序的能力互通，提升个人的自动化水平。
但事情情况并不尽如人意，虽然快捷指令编辑器提供了足够强大的编辑器，但三方应用对其支持并不好，大多数APP还是尽可能期望把用户圈在自己的生态中，没有开放足够的能力出来，这也是一款生态级应用的无奈。
想象中的快捷指令
现在应用商店的APP已经足够多，可以帮助人们解决足够多的问题，但有时候一款应用并不能完全解决某项任务，需要多个应用配合操作，如果用户可以随意调用应用中功能并组合成自己所需要完成特定任务的能力，那么用户体验和效率都将提升到新的高度。
想象一种场景，当我在观看自己感兴趣的外语视频时，因为语言的障碍可能不能足够理解视频内容，我需要一些辅助支持：我希望翻译软件能够帮我把外语翻译成母语，甚至希望语音合成软件将翻译后的语言读出来。孤立地看这个场景中的每个需求，都有应用能很好得实现：视频网站能够提供我感兴趣的内容，翻译软件能将语言进行较高准确度的翻译，语音合成软件能够将文字朗读出来。但是当这三个需求点分布在三个不同的APP时，用户就难以较高效率完成这个场景的任务。实际上每个APP的能力都被封锁在了自己APP里面。

上面说的这个场景我自己就有，但是因为没能使用现有工具很好使用，只得自己动手做了一个插件，可以朗读B站上面带有字幕的视频，因为微软的中文语音合成做得比较好，所以先放在Edge浏览器上了，目前还只支持带外挂字幕的视频，大家感兴趣也可以使用。

B站视频字幕朗读（中文同传）插件地址-> Microsoft Edge Addons
现实中的快捷指令
虽然当前快捷指令还不够优秀，但对于日常效率的提升还是有一定帮助的，特别是对于实现与苹果自带应用的互通。
举个使用的例子，每天早上我会用笔记软件记录一下昨日回顾、思考以及今日的计划，对于今日计划，我希望用待办应用去跟踪计划中事项的状态，但是手动把写过的东西在另一个APP里面再写一遍实在是太过愚蠢，于是我就写了快捷指令去实现。

实际使用中，只要选择对应的文本并在共享表单中点击对应的操作就可以同步到系统自带的提醒事项中，在mac上还可以添加快捷键一键实现（应该还可以通过「自动化」省去手动操作这一步）。
当前的快捷指令有三个亮点：

在快捷指令的编辑上采用图形化拖拽操作，相对于写脚本，这种操作显得更加友好，并且也可以支持自定义脚本的加入，甚至让我一度觉得学编程的第一个应用是用快捷指令写得；
在快捷指令的运行上打通了Siri、小组件以及共享操作，特别是后者，为与三方应用的结合提供了基础的平台；
加入了自动化功能，可以根据一定的规则直接省去了用户主动调用快捷指令这一步。

但要让更多的人在更多场景下使用快捷指令，还有着一些明显的不足：

上手使用上有一些门槛，官方没有详细的教程，虽然提供了一些案例，但是大多数人应该没有耐心仔细去看快捷中心中那些精选的指令是如何实现的，这点Mac上快捷指令前辈「自动操作」可能给点其启示，其中「录制」功能可以通过「我做给你看」自动识别操作中的事件；
快捷指令的分发做得还不够，既然不是每个人都能轻松使用快捷指令，那么获取现成的快捷指令则更加重要，但快捷指令中心中精选的指令本土化、个性化做得并不好，我觉得如果能根据用户所安装的APP来个性化分发常用的快捷指令会更友好；
三方应用的能力开放明显不足，大多数的使用场景还是围绕在苹果自带应用提供的能力，这点极大限制了快捷指令的应用场景；
使用Siri来激活快捷指令时对于指令的识别非常差，官方有说使用快捷指令的名称就可以通过Siri调用，但实际使用时不时语音识别不出来就是调用的指令不正确；

有趣的是，在WWDC2022中，我们看到苹果开始推广App Intent框架，通过为应用开发者提供更多系统级的入口曝光来吸引他们将其应用所能满足的用户意图曝光给系统，从而使得系统可以通过学习用户行为实现跨应用的能力整合。
结语
很多人即使生活中充满重复的事情也不会去探索提高效率方式，因为对比眼前简单的操作，去探究增进效率操作的所花费的学习努力带来的成本更加高，只是把时间线拉得足够远，才能看见效率提升所带来收益。
自动化所存在的意义是帮助人完成任务并节省时间，虽然我们每个人都已经拥有足够多的计算设备，但我们并没有充分发挥其拥有的算力，个人的自动化仍是一个尚待开发的领域。
期待未来的快捷指令能为个人的自动化增添更多的可能性。]]></summary>

Years ago while rummaging through the contents of a shelf in a used bookstore, I happened upon a booklet titled "UNIX System Command Summary for Berkeley 4.2 & 4.3 BSD," published by Specialized Systems Consultants. I bought it as a curiosity item because it was nearly 20 years old yet still largely applicable to modern Linux and BSD.
That amused me then and now. A booklet written in 1986 was still largely relevant in 2016, while books on the same shelf about a proprietary OS weren't worth the paper they were printed on. (Think about it: What technology do you think is going to survive a zombie apocalypse?) I've had the booklet on my own bookshelf for several years now, but it occurred to me that it's pro…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[记账是我坚持得最久的习惯，到如今已经快4年。
期间有中断过，怀疑过，也尝试过很多不同的工具，发现用对工具的确轻松很多，也更容易坚持。今天就来跟大家分享下我记账这些年的心路历程，希望能帮到正在犹豫记账的你。
我会先讲下我是如何坚持记账，以及记账对我的改变，最后再分享记账应用（附带视频），只想看评测的话可以直接跳到最后哦。
一、如何开始记账
我之所以开始记账，也是因为发现自己每个月钱都不知花哪去了，所以想通过记账来了解自己的收支情况，让自己对生活掌控得更好。
一开始是消费一单就记一次，但太繁琐了，经常会忘记。所以就改成了每天固定睡前记账。但这样，依旧老是忘记，于是我设置了每晚10点的定时闹钟，效果就好很多了。等到养成习惯后，就再也不用设置闹钟了，以后一到那个点，脑子就自动提醒我记账，偶有遗忘，但也慢慢坚持下来了。而且因为我用打卡app，所以如果没记账，那天的记录就会为空，出于强迫症的原因，我也一定会把缺的那天补上。就这么不知不觉坚持了快4年。
但其实，我这种每一笔都记的方式还是比较费劲的，不一定适合所有人，我这里推荐两个降低难度的方式：

别全部都都记，这样太琐碎，而是设置一个额度，高于该额度的支出才记。
是充分利用记账应用，选择有自动同步账单功能，或者支持语音输入的记账应用，下面有推荐类似的App。

二、对记账的反思
那我这样记账4年下来的结果如何呢？
一方面，我的确因此免去了许多不必要的开支，存住了钱，对比起身边一些朋友，有储蓄更踏实，还可以把闲钱拿出来投资理财。
但另一方面，我也明显感觉自己似乎有点 落伍了......当同龄人在炫耀新买的电子产品、潮牌、口红包包时，当别人用钱堆出来一个时髦大方的形象时，其实很难不羡慕。可是让我去购买一些非必需品，这带来的罪恶感，又远大于我得到它的满足感。

是的，记账的习惯，让我的消费习惯变成了——只买有用的东西。

In the Lua programming language, an array is called a table. A table is used in Lua to store data. If you're storing a lot of data in a structured way, it's useful to know your options for retrieving that data when you need it.

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。

瑞典时间 10 月 4 日上午，诺贝尔奖委员会宣布 2022 年诺贝尔物理学奖授予阿兰·阿斯佩克特 (Alain Aspect)、约翰·克劳瑟 (John F. Clauser) 和安东·泽林格 (Anton Zeilinger)，以表彰他们 「进行了纠缠光子的实验，确立了对贝尔不等式的不成立并开创了量子信息科学」。阿兰·阿斯佩克特、约翰·克劳瑟和安东·泽林格分别利用处于相互纠缠的量子态进行了突破性的实验。在这种情况下，两个粒子即使被分开也表现得如同一个整体。他们的成果为基于量子信息的新技术扫清了道路。
—— 摘自诺贝尔物理学奖官方新闻稿

说实话，在诺贝尔奖委员会正式宣布量子纠缠相关的成果获奖后，我立刻就意识到，互联网上很快就会充斥着各种针对量子纠缠以及量子世界的神秘性相关的科普。这些科普，无论是原创的还是东拼西凑的，无论是专家学者起草的还是各路内容流水线上生产的，都有一个共同的特征：它们往往都喜欢强化量子物理的神秘性和不可理解。
我承认，历史上确实有这么一段时间，即使是 20 世纪初期那些鼎鼎大名的物理学家，都曾为量子相关的物理现象感到困惑。然而，经过一百多年的发展，量子物理的诸多核心概念早就被一代又一代的物理学家里里外外地玩了个遍，以至于许多被科普作家渲染得神乎其神的概念，现正躺在物理系本科生的必修课教材里。
当然，量子力学有它反直觉的地方。但是，现实生活中反直觉的事情还少吗？反直觉并不意味着神秘或不可理解。它只是需要你屏蔽你的许多生活常识，用绝对的理性来思考问题。所以，这篇文章会和你读过的绝大部分科普不同，我不会把量子…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[引言：用惯旗舰的我，为啥突然自购了一台入门DAP？

我承认，这个标题有点蹭过时热搜的标题党嫌疑；但作为一个有着五六年HiFi设备购买经验、分享却极其佛系的用户，收获不能说是经验丰富吧，至少也能说是白忙一场；自从三年以前第一次入手了旗舰级的KANN CUBE之后，为了追求“好马配好鞍”，在便携领域各种入手搭配的旗舰耳塞线材套装，洒出去的钱也有个五位数往上了。虽然标题上写着是对节奏坦克新款播放器V6的体验，但从某种程度上来说，这篇文章也算是玩了这么久的HiFi设备之后，一篇简单的自我回顾和反思文章。
在半个月前，我绝对不可能相信听惯了“旗舰级DAP”的自己会甘于使用一台中低端价位的播放器，即便中低端播放器近年来也的确出现过不少声音表现优秀、拉动价位甚至行业疯狂内卷的机器，但高端播放器毕竟有自己的能力与气场：作为品牌的旗舰，一般都有着最好的用料、最新的功能配置、最前沿的DAC芯片——著名的Astell&Kern甚至没事就和上游的旭化成深度合作，三代SP系列几乎成为AKM全新旗舰DAC的首发平台；同时也倾注着品牌最优秀的音乐理解。
很显然，这些资源优势都是一般中低端播放器很难获得的，所以我现在依旧不怀疑“正经厂牌的高端播放器在综合素质表现上必然优于中低端产品”；以上观点也不代表我认为“所有人都必须和我一样不买个几万块东西就别想快乐听歌”，如果你的天桥9.9耳机已经让你非常快乐，那太好了，什么设备都理应有快乐听歌的权利。我开始怀疑的是，每天没事盯着见底的工资卡、紧了吧唧的盘算着怎么搭配耳机播放器，导致我个人的生活多了一堆需要计较的大小事，这些真的能让我听歌的过程变得更“快乐”吗？

因此这半个月的时间刚好给了我一个机会，你也可以认为这种机会比较祸福相依：我自购的SP1000在半个月前，因为某些极其离谱的外部非质量原因，不慎导致2.5mm接口损坏，被迫返厂维修。设备虽然要修，歌却不能…]]></summary>

Lua is a scripting language used for procedural programming, functional programming, and even object-oriented programming. It uses a C-like syntax, but is dynamically typed, features automatic memory management and garbage collection, and runs by interpreting bytecode with a register-based virtual machine. This makes it a great language for beginners, but also a powerful tool for experienced programmers.
Lua has been somewhat eclipsed from the public view by languages like Python and JavaScript, but Lua has several advantages that make it popular in some major software projects. Lua is easily embedded within other languages, meaning that you can include Lua files in the code base of something written in (for instance)…]]></summary>

Phil Shapiro

Long ago, when I was a tech administrator for Arlington Public Schools, I received an unexpected email saying, "Our school in India loves your children's stories, so we've printed them all out in braille."
Apparently, the school had found my collection of children's stories on the web. I spent a moment visualizing those students so far away, enjoying my stories on those printed pages of braille. The email's sender might not have realized how meaningful their email was to me, but it's stayed with me for two decades.
Tell collaborative stories with open source
That experience got me thinking about how technology can weave new connections between people in different countries. While surfing…]]></summary>

想想看，平时在阅读上，你做了多少无用功？
勤勤恳恳阅读，认认真真做好高亮批注。你看到自己的思考结果与文章或者书中的文字融于一体，觉得特别安心。
然而，当你需要整理或者调用这些笔记的时候，才发现它们如同断线的珠子，散落在各种地方：
RSS 阅读内容在 feedspot 里； 微信公众号的高亮在 Instapaper 里；Epub 标记在 Marginnote 里；PDF 的高亮和批注在 LiquidText 里面…… 如果不加整理，它们就会在不同的应用中终老。
问题来了，该怎么整理这些散落的阅读笔记？
有的人并不觉得这是个棘手的事情。他们的作息时间，如同钟表一般规律。可以做到每天晚上专门花时间，雷打不动把这些内容整理出来，做好分类，放在 Evernote 或者 Obsidian 里。
但是，这种方法，对于懒人显然不友好。至少我自己，就笃定无法日复一日坚持下去。即便我希望能持续一周这样操作，恐怕都得专门雇个人在旁边监督自己。
幸好，技术的进步使我们不用活得那么悲摧。有一些工具可以帮助我们汇集各种资料，尤其是帮你保管阅读记录和高亮、批注。更好的消息，是这些工具有很多，例如 Readwise, Matter, Diigo, Cubox 和简悦（Simpread）等。
本文我就以自己常用的 Readwise 为例，为你介绍如何自动化汇集整理和利用笔记。希望这些经验也能够帮到你，早日摆脱手动整理阅读笔记的困扰。
Readwise
我是 2020 年 4 月开始使用 Readwise 的。7 天试用期过后，我发邮件找 Readwise 官方申请了个教育优惠，就开始使用了。

Readwise 的特点，是支持非常广泛的信息输入来源，例如我这里已经连接的来源包括 Kindle, Instapaper, Medium, Airr, Twitter, Apple Books 等等。

Advertisers sell the myth of the "Smart Home" as a magical world where you automate everything with ease to simplify your life and free your mind of trivial tasks. It looks great on paper and TV, but so far, it's mainly been a battle of technologies and manufacturers.
Suppose you want to add a presence sensor from manufacturer A to your existing hub from manufacturer B so you can switch ON your light from manufacturer B. Or perhaps you want to switch OFF your air conditioner when your door is open, but the door sensor is not from the air conditioning manufacturer. Will it work?
There's a significant chance that the devices you want to link to one another don't talk the same …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[iA Writer 是一款非常著名的，以简洁优美的界面和不错的使用体验著称的 Markdown 写作软件（虽然我没用过）。而最近，iA Writer 的开发商 iA.net 发布了一款名为 iA Presenter 的幻灯片制作软件，旨在通过简单的 Markdown 创作出精美的幻灯片。
市面上制作幻灯片的软件已经是数不胜数，除了常见的 PowerPoint、Keynote，还有基于 HTML5 技术的 Prezi、reveal.js、Canva 等，基于文档生成幻灯片的软件也有不少，比如双链笔记软件 Obsidian、文档工具语雀、飞书文档、石墨文档都有演示模式。
在这么多软件之中，iA Presenter 又有哪些优势，值得我们从繁杂的工作中抬起头来呢。
首先说明一下，目前 iA Presenter 还处于一个非常早期的阶段，文中提到的一些内容随时可能会因为软件的版本更新而发生变更。
另外，下文中会将 iA Presenter 简称为 iA Pre。
在此，也感谢 @南山居氪 提供的 iA Presenter 的邀请码。
PowerPoint 发生了什么
似乎现在很多软件都在以一种革命性的姿态来发布——认为自己的诞生能够颠覆一个行业，至少在发布时会伴随着一些阐述自己设计哲学的文章。Roam 和 Arc 是如此，iA Pre 也有些这样的味道。
iA 在其新闻页面上发了两篇文章，主要在说 PowerPoint 等传统幻灯片工具有什么问题，和 iA Pre 怎样使幻灯片更好？。
在第一篇文章1中，iA 认为，以 PPT 为代表的传统幻灯片工具有着入门难、耗时长、会让演讲者忘记他想说的东西、以及搭配 PPT 的演讲大多很无聊，这种无聊是我们的职业杀手以及事业杀手。
iA 怎样使幻灯片更好？
而在第二篇文章2中，iA 提出了他们认为的让演讲和幻灯片制作变得更好的方法：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[很多人会把人生比喻为游戏，因为都需要在既定的规则下，和他人同台竞争谋求最大胜利，读书时的升学排名，就业后岗位的激烈竞争，无一不是要决出个胜负，每个人都要追求赢。
但我们可能从来没有想过，除了参加有输赢的游戏，其实我们还可以选择另一种游戏——没有输赢，可以持续玩下去的游戏。
这便是《有限与无限的游戏》中的观点，它认为世界上至少有有限和无限两种游戏，有限游戏以获胜为目的，无限游戏以延续游戏为目的。
很神奇的是，我之前从《游戏改变世界》这本书中首次知晓该理论时，只是觉得有意思，但对我并没什么启发。

可是真的当我自己看完这本20万字的小书后，对我的影响却是立竿见影的。我读完隔天，在工作上和同事发生冲突时，脑子里一直在想着“不行，我不能像对方一样发火，我要玩的是无限游戏，争一时的输赢的玩不下去了”，因此就忍住了火气，最终也顺利解决了问题。
所以呢今天也为大家推荐这本书，看完后你一定会觉得，哇，原来有些竞争是根本没必要投入的，原来选择还可以有这么多，生活的改变从心态的改变开始，相信你也可以和我一样豁然开朗！
不过该书其实是本哲学书，理解和解读起来有一定难度，而且写法更偏意识流，作者没有特意去构建严密的框架和推理，甚至全书中作者自己都没有直接发表过「无限游戏更好」的结论，所以我会加入个人的理解去解读以便更好地介绍，但我也只是抛砖引玉，建议大家过后去看全书。
一、有限与无限游戏的基本概念
有限游戏有三个显著特征。

它是以取胜为目的，一旦决出胜负则游戏结束，所以称之为有限游戏，注意这里的胜负必须是所有参与者认同，而不是裁判或观众认同。
参与者只能在游戏界限内进行游戏。
有限游戏的规则一经所有参与者认同就生效，且不能改变，否则就是另一个游戏了。

怎么样，听起来是不是很熟悉，几乎跟我们从小到大遇到的竞争一个模式。而无限游戏则恰好是跟它反着来的，它也有三个相对的显特征。

它并非以取胜为目的…]]></summary>

上几篇专栏介绍了绿色系、蓝色系，自然少不了光学三原色的另一名成员——红色。这一期来讲讲红色系键帽，方便各位键友选购搭配自己的梦中情键。

GMK Red Samurai 红武士
R1 2018.2 R2 2020
BASE
这套键帽是由设计师Redsun（红太阳）设计而成，同时他也是GMK蓝武士的设计师，gmk四大武士中的两款由他设计。关于这套键帽的灵感来源有两个版本。
在R1的IC中。

作者表示灵感来自于火影忍者中宇智波斑的铠甲颜色

而在R2中

作者则表示灵感来源于井伊直政（日本历史角色）
关于作者灵感来源，我还是更加倾向于R1中的说法，而为何要改口，可能是为了规避版权问题，但我个人觉得，在红武士中其实并不能看出过多来自于漫画中的角色要素，并且忍者和武士也是两种职业，作者关于忍者和武士的定义，好像也并没有非常清晰。
配色：

暗黄、深红、灰黑，低调而不失深度的配色，黑红相间配以金色点缀，经典耐看。
个性部分：

这一套的个性数量和种类都非常丰富“忍”“侍”，其实这一套键帽虽然称之为武士，但里面也融合了非常多忍者的元素，在武器类型中“飞镰”、“团扇”、“手里剑”、“苦无”，都是非常常见的忍者标志性武器，还有一些不明所以的图案。
其实这位作者在R1中的早期个性设计，是带有浓烈火影忍者特色的。
早期个性设计
穿着盔甲的天狗，很显然是宇智波斑的须佐能乎，以及极其明显的神威万花筒写轮眼图案。
但在最终敲定版本中为了规避版权问题进行了大刀阔斧的修改，最终便呈现出一个极具忍者风味的武士主题键帽。

搭配建议：
深色无疑是合适的，这套键帽很是百搭，红色、蓝色、黄色，都能驾驭，我个人最喜欢灰色和黑色进行搭配，红色也是很不错的，但过于鲜亮的颜色搭配起来难度还是…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[相信大部份人用的都是拼音輸入法。
學會一個非拼音的中文輸入法，是一件好玩的事，這是一項實用的技能，能證明你的智商和學習能力。
以後搞博客，工作，寫作，成為作家，跟人聊天，等等很多地方都能用上。
其實很多人對「形碼」還存在誤解。

誤解一，除了拼音就是五筆。
其實形碼是一衆不以拼音而是字形部件組合來輸入中文的方法。著名的有：倉頡、鄭碼、五筆，等等。
其中五筆是最有名，但又是最難學最難用的。
誤解二，形碼一定比拼音快。
其實形碼並不一定比拼音快，比如我用倉頡打「哈哈哈哈」，我輸入的是「romr romr romr romr 」，而拼音只需要輸入「hhhh 」。
也就是說，在某些特定場合，拼音，簡拼，比形碼還要快。
那形碼的優點是甚麼？形碼不是快，而是準。形碼人的思維是，如果連準確輸入都做不到，那快有甚麼用？
誤解三，五筆（形碼）很難，要背很多字根。
其實是因為五筆的字根太多太難背，才會給人這樣的感受。我用過五筆兩年，我也承認背字根是一個非常高的門檻。
但是，並不是所有形碼都跟五筆一樣難背。倉頡輸入法的字元就比五筆少很多，好記很多，記下根本不費吹灰之力。
誤解四，學個輸入法要浪費很多時間，學會了也沒甚麼用。
這是極其錯誤的想法。中文打字，不管到哪裏，都是實用的技能。現在網上到處都是同音錯字，比如「再在」不分，就是因為拼音輸入法根本打不準。那麼如果你跟別人文字聊天時，或者發表文章時，能做到用字準確，那不就是一個加分項嗎？
因此，花費一點時間，去學一個形碼，是事半功倍的事。一個好的中文輸入法，是可以用一輩子的。而你只需要用掉幾日的時間來學習。

先寫到這裏。我是中文輸入法專家尹卂，目前在用倉頡。有甚麼問題可以在下方留言。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
2022年10月24日，特斯拉官宣降价，基础版本model 3降价1.4万，model y降价2.8万，可以说是非常大的降价幅度，结合2022款整体上更新的车机芯片加上扩大的电池容量，一部分车款可以说是重回性价比车型的行列。
我们讲电车使用成本低，是基于有家用充电桩的环境，如果都用特斯拉超充，不算停车费，每公里电费都能到3毛以上，而使用谷时电家充，每公里电费可以控制在5分钱。但家充桩需要有固定车位，还要向电网申请电表，以及需要物业允许施工的证明，这些硬性条件也劝退着一些潜在车主。
而除了固定的家用充电桩，还有便携充电器，也就是随车充可以作为新能源车的补能方案。随车充在使用上可以使用家庭插座，支持自带线缆从家中接到室外充电，不需要独立电表，对于公司有插座、农村有自建房以及低楼层居民楼住户都比较友好。
本篇选择了四款随车充，覆盖了品牌、设计特点、功率支持的几个不同方向，来详细对比产品设计和具体功能，希望能为随车充的选择答疑解惑。
缆上控制与保护装置（IC-CDP)

其实随车充产品我分析过很多次，它本质上就是从电源到新能源车电机的连接装置，换言之就是一根电源线，电能转化为电池电量都是在新能源车内部完成的。而对于随车充产品消费首先需要重点关注的就是是否配备了缆上控制与保护装置，缩写为IC-CDP。
在国家标准GB/T 18487.1-2015《电动汽车传导充电系统 第一部分:通用要求》中，将就是一根电缆连接电动汽车和交流电网的随车充称为模式1产品；将电缆上加入IC-CDP的随车充产品称为模式2产品。前者可以为车充电，根据电缆长度不同售价在200元上下，但模式1产品缺乏保护功能和控制功能，便宜但抗风险能力基本为0。后者模式2则是大部分车主的核心选择，通过控制盒可以实现各种差异化功能，特斯拉、比亚迪的原厂随车充我们称为车规产品，都是模式2随车充。
对于我们私家车主而言，充电安全…]]></summary>
