        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rust takes a loooot of time to compile, even with incremental compilation. It's not rare that a small change leads to 2 or 3 minutes of compilation to test the change, which frustrates a lot of new rustaceans. It's a deliberate choice made by the language designers to favor runtime speed over compilation speed (it's why we love Rust: raw speed), and there is no magic incantation or cheat code to reduce this compilation time.
It took me some time to find a good workflow, which does not break my flow state (when I'm in the zone), so I thought it was worth sharing if it can save you time, dear reader.
But first, I have a question: What makes you happier, swimming against the current or embracing the flow and getting things done?

Comments and extra spaces are removed
Provides short names for variables and functions
Removes unwanted variables
Uses:
Reduce file size intern reduces load times
Improves site speed and accessibility
Can be accessed with low bandwidth network





// Sample javascript file
function print() {
console.log('Hello World!');
}
print();


It's minified version is:
function print(){console.log("Hello World!")}print();

Obfuscation:
Business logic is not exposed
Obfuscated isn't readable hence copying and reusing is not possible.
It prevents vulnerable attackes
For the above same code snippet's obfuscated version is:

You can add another name to your list of filmmakers attempting to develop the next Star Wars film: Damon Lindelof. Deadline reports that Lindelof, who rose to prominence as the co-creator of Lost and more recently won multiple Emmys for his work on HBO’s TV adaptation of Watchmen, is developing and co-writing the film, although it’s unclear who his writing partner could be. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, who worked on several episodes of Ms. Marvel, is reportedly in talks to direct. 
The Star Wars franchise has been absent from the big screen since 2019’s Rise of Skywalker, with various in-development efforts coming to nothing (so far). Last Jedi director Rian Johnson has been working since 2017 to create a new trilogy of new Star Wars movies...

Web Workers are a simple means for web content to run scripts in background threads. The worker thread can perform tasks without interfering with the user interface. In addition, they can perform I/O using XMLHttpRequest (although the responseXML and channel attributes are always null) or fetch (with no such restrictions). Once created, a worker can send messages to the JavaScript code that created it by posting messages to an event handler specified by that code (and vice versa).

Linux 的通用 TUN 驱动为用户空间的程序提供数据包接收和传输，该驱动长期以来一直在 Linux 内核中使用，可用于 VPN、Open vSwitch 等用途。将近二十年前，Linux TUN 驱动设置了一个 10Mbps 链接的标称速度，这在当时足够了。但是现在，Linux 网络堆栈和硬件都有了很大的进步。开发者提出了一个补丁，将该设定值提升一千倍到 10Gbps，并建议干脆取消该限制，而让应用程序/用户自己决定一个正确的值。

GitHub 准备推出细粒度的个人访问令牌

GitHub 在 2020 年提供了 OAuth 认证，再之后，GitHub.com 所有认证的 Git 操作都需要基于令牌的认证，而不再接受账户密码。但 GitHub 的个人访问令牌只能被赋予有限的权限，也不是按仓库分配的，而且只有几个宽泛的类别。新的正在测试中的令牌是细粒度的，每个仓库有 25 种权限，其中大部分权限可以设置为只读、读写或不访问，另外有 14 种权限与账户管理有关。

The git log command offers many opportunities to learn more about the commits made by contributors. One way you might consume such information is by date. To view commits in a Git repository created on a specific date or range of dates, use the git log command with the options --since or --until, or both.

More on Git
What is Git?
Git cheat sheet
Markdown cheat sheet
New Git articles
First, checkout the branch you want to inspect (for example, main):
$ git checkout main
Next, display the commits for the current date (today):
$ git log --oneline --since="yesterday"
Display commits for the current date by a specific author only (for example, Agil):
$ git log --oneline --since="yesterday" --author="Agil"
You can also display results for a range of dates. Display commits between any two dates (for example, 22 April 2022 and 24 April 2022):
$ git log --oneline --since="2022-04-22" --until="2022-04-24"
In this example, the output displays all the commits between 22 April 2022 and 24 April 2022, which excludes the commits done on 22 April 2022. If you want to include the commits done on 22 April 2022, replace 2022-04-22 with 2022-04-21.
Run the following command to display commits between any two dates by a specific author only (for example, Agil):
$ git log --oneline --since="2022-04-22" \
--until="2022-04-24" --author="Agil"

Reporting
Git has many advantages, and one of them is the way it enables you to gather data about your project. The git log command is an important reporting tool and yet another reason to use Git!

A progressive web app (PWA) is a web application that uses modern web technologies to deliver a user experience equal to any mobile app. An active open source community, in conjunction with tech leaders like Google and Microsoft, pushes the PWA agenda forward in an effort to "bridge the app gap."
Basically, a PWA runs your app in a web browser. Because there's essentially a two-party system of the Play and App stores, the focus is on two browsers: Google Chrome and Apple Safari (built on top of the open source Chromium and WebKit, respectively).
I won't be covering creating desktop apps. For more information on that topic, look into Electron.

What you will be building, see the demo on the Goerli test network and git repo here.

Web3 development is officially the new way to build web applications, and if you are not there yet, you need to catch up. The way to master building web3 apps is by understanding smart contracts, a frontend framework such as React, and how to link the smart contract with the front end.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a decentralized web3 eShop for selling game items using the native ethereum currency.
This app comprises the smart contract layer, a front end where all the interactions with the smart contract take place, and an anonymous chat feature using the CometChat SDK.

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

为何是阅读器
大学毕业后，我告别了拥有海量藏书的图书馆，开始了漫长的阅读工具体验之旅。
起初，惯性思维让我从当当、京东等大平台买书来读。我喜欢撕掉新书塑封时的期待心情，也慢慢攒起来了自己的第一批库存。新书的开销几乎成为刚毕业的我除吃饭和租房外的第三大支出项。
后来，多抓鱼开始了他们的创业，我也成为了他们的最早一批用户。我在他们的小程序上养成了买二手书的习惯，也尝试着卖掉了一些看完的书。我喜欢这种循环与分享的理念，有时收到他人批注过的书页，时有共鸣，像是在和一名未曾谋面的老友会心一笑。
然而北漂不易，在这样试运行了快三年后，寸土寸金的租房空间已经难以下脚。再加上数次搬家几乎成了北漂的必修课，因此「纸质书」在我这里已经逐渐和「奢侈品」画了等号。我开始把目光转向电子书。
彼时「蜗牛阅读」早于「微信阅读」兴起，我用手机读完每天免费的一小时，眼睛已经感觉酸涩。后来我尝试了 iPad 版本，视觉的疲劳感依然没有好转。于是像每一个热爱阅读或者感觉自己热爱阅读的人一样，我下单了人生的第一台 Kindle，开始了我的阅读器泡面之旅。
Kindle 的小屏幕让我非常不适应。由于阅读惯性使然，为了尽可能获得和纸质书的一页近似的信息量，我需要把字体调整到很小，然而字体变小又让阅读本身变得吃力。加上 Kindle Unlimited 并不优质的资源和第三方网站的不稳定，我发现 Kindle 在我这里并没有代替纸质书的地位，反而是新鲜感过后，逐渐落入吃灰的境地。
再后来，得到 app 开始推出了电子书的业务，上线初期是 148元/年。我这个得到重度用户试用了…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a very much needed requirement in all most all web applications as and when backend doesn't support download for given results. 
We generally populate results in table -> To populate we need to iterate over array contains data objects.
Like,
const data = [
{ name: 'Tom', id: '1234'},
{ name: 'James', id: '3456'},
{ name: 'Jerry', id: '7890'},
{ name: 'Peter', id: '4321'}
];

And, the above forms table as:

Just want same results to be downloaded as CSV.
  const headers = Object.keys(data[0]).join();
    const content = data.map(value => Object.values(value).join());
    const csv = [headers].concat(content).join("\n");
    const element = document.createElement('a');
    element.href = 'data:text/csv;charset=utf-8,' + encodeURI(csv);
    element.target = '_blank';
    element.download = 'export.csv';
    element.click();

Done. Your CSV gets download as show in below:

Always welcome any improvements.
Thanks.

Stencil is a very nice compiler for Typescript that generates web components. If I were to place it, it would be a mixture between Angular and React. It uses decorators like Angular does (for the compiler to collect metadata and generate the output code based on that), and jsx/tsx with lifecycles just like React. It is a very powerfool tool to generate design systems.
In this design system that I've been working on, there was the problem of how to store the global state. I wanted to have a simple version of DI (since I really liked it in Angular). The big advantage of using a DI system is that you can easily mock the services in tests, instead of needing…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[引言
iPad中关于键盘的设置与鼠标一样 —— 非常混乱。例如，iPad键盘的设置也是出现在「通用 | 键盘」、「辅助功能 | 键盘」以及「辅助功能 | 触控 — 辅助触控」中。
其中，「辅助功能 | 触控 — 辅助触控」其实就是上一篇文章中的「鼠标键」，具体可以参考《鼠标搭配 iPadOS，如何设置才能更好用？》
「通用 | 键盘 — 实体键盘」
键位调节
在实体键盘中，你可以根据iPad已有的输入法进行键位调节。例如我们常用的是QWERTY键盘，而你可以在这里改成AZERTY等。

 
下面的几项设置中，大家基本都能理解，而且也无关痛痒。笔者认为比较重要的是下面两个：
按下🌐显示表情符号
首先，这个🌐符号在妙控键盘里就是左下角的fn。
显示表情符号这个按钮，比较适合常用emoji😄的场景。例如‼️，一般写小🍠的朋友都需要用较多的emoji来分1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣等小标题，那么打开这个功能就会非常方便啦✨。
实际上，就算打开了这个功能，也不会影响我们切换输入法，因为使用control+空格也能轻松切换输入法，与我们使用Mac的习惯一样。

使用大写锁定键切换语言
第二个功能也是Mac中特有的功能。从Windows换到Mac的用户很不爽的一点是：想按Caplock键来输入大写字母，结果只能切换输入法，非得长按才行。
实际上这个功能是可以开关的，iPad上也一样。打开后，我们可以自由地在当前输入法和英文输入法之间切换（如果当前是简体中文输入法，那么就是中——英；如果是俄语输入法，那么便是俄——英），如果在键盘语言中把英文输入法删除的话，这个功能即使打开也不能使用了。关闭后，我们按下Caplock键就能切换为全大写输入。macOS中也一样，删除自带的中文输入法（英文输入法不能删除），就不能实现这个功能。

「辅助功能 | 键盘」

辅助功能中的键盘设置分为两个部分，一个是…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu 22.10 是一个令人印象深刻的版本，它拥有新的快速切换功能、应用程序散布，以及更多。




Ubuntu 22.10 “充满活力的捻角羚Kinetic Kudu”来了。它带来了许多重大的改进，特别是 Linux 内核 5.19 和 GNOME 43 的体验。

当然，这是一个经过定制的 GNOME 体验，现有的 Ubuntu 用户会很熟悉。

那么，Ubuntu 22.10 都有哪些新变化呢？让我们一起来看看。

Ubuntu 22.10 的新变化



除了 GNOME 43 之外，Ubuntu 22.10 还包括：


一个改进的 设置Settings 应用程序。

经典的 Unity 应用程序散布模式Spread Mode的复活。

一些著名的应用程序被移植到 GTK4 和 Libadwaita。

全系统支持 WebP。

PipeWire 采样管默认的音频服务器。

Linux 内核 5.19。



💡 Ubuntu 22.10 将被支持九个月，直到 2023 年 7 月。如果你想要稳定而不是功能，你应该更愿意使用 LTS 版本。


🎨 视觉改进

当第一次测试一个新版本时，视觉上的变化总是最先被注意到的。在 Ubuntu 22.10 中尤其如此，这要归功于 GNOME 43 所带来的重大改进。



首先，我们有全新的快速设置菜单，它取代了旧的、相当笨拙的系统菜单。与安卓、iOS 和 Windows 11 中的菜单类似，这个新增的菜单允许你打开和关闭 Wi-Fi 和蓝牙，所有这些都无需进入设置Settings应用程序。

当然，在这个版本中我们还得到了全新的壁纸。



对于这个变化，我除了喜欢并希望从社区中看到更多这样的设计之外，没有什么别的可说的。

此外，更多的应用程序被移植到…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当商业 DevOps 工具市场着眼于平台时，是时候让开源 DevOps 工具重新定义它们的未来了。


DevOps 的开源根基是无法动摇的，即便有预言称全球的 DevOps 市场将在 2026 年之前达到 178 亿美元。不断变化的工作环境、安全和合规性问题，以及风险投资公司等等因素正在将市场推向 DevOps 平台，开发团队可以在云中获得完整的端到端 DevOps 工具链。

开源 DevOps 工具现状

我们要搞清楚一件事：开源工具不可能从 DevOps 世界中消失。现在，在开源和供应商提供的 DevOps 工具之间存在着一种平衡，开发人员会在两者间选择适合他们的工具。事实上，很多情况下，一个开发团队起初会为他们的 DevOps 流水线选择一个开源工具，后来又升级到商业版本。

三种开源 DevOps 工具实例

下面我们介绍一些开源 DevOps 工具的例子，每种工具都已经有了围绕其建立的商业化生态。

Git

源代码管理工具 Git 作为源代码库，可能是 DevOps 工具链的主要基础之一。

Git 的两个最佳商业案例是 GitLab 和 GitHub。GitLab 接受开发者对其贡献开源项目。GitHub 也在着手努力成为一个 DevOps 平台，推出了人工智能版的结对编程 GitHub Copilot，在推出后受到了一些开源团体的褒贬不一的评价。

Jenkins

作为一个开源的自动化服务，Jenkins 因其易于安装、配置和可扩展性而受到推崇。

CloudBees 提供了 JenkinsX，JenkinsX 是一套开源的解决方案，可以为 Kubernetes 上的云原生应用提供自动化持续集成和持续交付（CI/CD）以及自动化测试工具。他们还为JenkinsX 提供商业支持，包括：

The Wire, an independent news outlet based in India, retracted its story that accused Meta of granting an Indian politician special permissions to remove posts on its platforms. In an update posted on Sunday, The Wire says it has decided to retract its report after “certain discrepancies” emerged in the evidence it used to back up its claims.
“Our investigation, which is ongoing, does not as yet allow us to take a conclusive view about the authenticity and bona fides of the sources with whom a member of our reporting team says he has been in touch over an extended period of time,” the outlet explains. “We are still reviewing the entire matter, including the possibility that it was deliberately sought to misinform or deceive The Wire.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌和苹果的短信标准对抗再次升级

iPhone 的短信应用 iMessage 不支持现代的 RCS 标准，因此，从 iPhone 发往安卓的短信只能采用古老的 SMS 标准。RCS 是 2008 年推出的旨在取代 SMS 的短信标准，支持更丰富的功能。它和 iMessage 一样，其信息是通过互联网传递，而不是通过电信运营商。为了使 iPhone 也能支持先进的 RCS 规范，安卓不断向苹果施压，甚至专门做了一个页面，上面有一些按钮可以让用户给苹果的 Twitter 发消息敦促它。但是苹果就是一无所动。现在，就像 iPhone 发往安卓的短信一样，当安卓用户用表情符对 iPhone 发来的短信做出回应时，iPhone 用户收到的短信不是显示该表情符，而是对该表情符的文字描述，如“爱心”这样的文字。


消息来源：Insider



老王点评：说到底，是苹果觉得支持 RCS 对它没好处，而迫使用户都用它的 iPhone。




开源网络安全监控平台 Zeek 成为 Windows 的一部分

发布于 1998 年的 Zeek（最初名为 Bro）正在被整合到 Windows 中，成为微软 Defender 的一部分，“现在已经部署在全球超过 10 亿个端点上。”Zeek 可以将网络流量转化为紧凑和高保真的日志、文件内容和行为分析，以加快安全操作。Zeek 的创始人称，“我从未想过我开发的网络监控工具会在防御端点方面找到更广泛的应用 —— 但这是开源开发的创造性魔法的一部分”。


消息来源：Corelight



老王点评：微软对采用开源软件方面毫无心理障碍，凡是好的都会想办法拿到 Windows 里面。




苹果宣布下周起更多广告将进入应用商店

苹果宣布从 10 月 25 日开始，在除中国以外的所有国家，与应用程序相关的广告将开始出现在苹果应用商店的主“今日”标签和单个应用程序列表底部的“您可能也喜欢”部分。这是开发者首次能够在“今日”标签上投放广告。“您可能也喜欢”的广告是增加实际“应用税”的另一种手段，迫使开发者在自己的应用页面上购买广告，以避免其他人将客户从自己手上引导走。苹果应用商店的广告以前只限于基于关键词的搜索结果和搜索标签的“建议”部分。苹果希望在未来将其目前的广告收入增加近三倍，达到每年至少 100 亿美元。


消息来源：MacRumors



老王点评：所以，就像 WIRED 说的那样，苹果现在是一家广告公司。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是在 GNOME 文件应用中以 root 身份访问文件或目录的最简单方法。




在 Windows 中，你通常可以在右键单击上下文菜单中以“以管理员身份打开”的方式打开文件或文件夹。

该功能是文件管理器的一部分，对于 Windows，它是 Windows 资源管理器的一部分。但是，它是由操作系统及其权限控制模块执行的。

在 Linux 发行版及其文件管理器中，情况略有不同。不同的桌面有自己的处理方式。

由于以管理员（root）身份修改文件和文件夹是有风险的，并且可能导致系统损坏，因此用户无法通过文件管理器的 GUI 轻松使用该功能。

例如，KDE Plasma 的默认文件管理器（Dolphin）最近 添加了此功能，因此当需要 root 权限时，它会通过 PolicyKit KDE Agent（polkit）窗口询问你，如下所示。



而不是相反的方式。比如，你想在文件管理器中通过 root 打开/执行一些东西时，你不能使用 sudo dolphin 以 root 权限运行文件管理器本身。

在某种程度上，它挽救了许多不可预见的情况。但是高级用户总是可以通过终端使用 sudo 来完成他们的工作。

GNOME 文件应用（Nautilus）和对文件、目录的 root 访问权限

话虽如此，GNOME 文件应用（又名 Nautilus）有一种方法可以通过 root 打开文件和文件夹。

以下是方法：


打开 GNOME 文件应用（Nautilus）。

然后单击左侧窗格中的“其他位置Other Locations”。

按 CTRL+L 调出地址栏。

在地址栏中，输入下面的内容并回车。
admin:///



它会要求输入管理员密码。当你成功验证，你就会以管理员身份打开系统。

现在，从这里开始，无论你做什么，它都是管理员或 root。








但是，与往常一样，请小心你作为管理员所做的事情。在你以 root 身份验证自己之后，通常很容易忘记。

这些选项不容易看到总是有原因的，以防止你和许多新的 Linux 用户破坏他们的系统。

祝好。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Matrix 首页推荐
Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

一年多前，由于工作原因，主力开发机换成了 Windows，还入了 Office 365 全家桶。于是在时隔多年后，再次用起了 OneNote。不得不说，都 2022 年了，OneNote 的码字体验还停留在十多年前，一堆大大小小的遗留问题。但我实在懒得折腾什么 Notion、Obsidian（没有复杂的知识管理需求），只想找个本地/靠谱/大厂出品/开箱即用的笔记软件，简单记录下工作相关内容。 毕竟人一旦习惯了 markdown 的符号 # 和 -，就真的回不去了。于是研究了下 OneNote 的 api，决定自己动手，丰衣足食。OneMark 由此诞生。
实时渲染
废话不多说，直接上动图。

简单来说，OneMark 实现了基于行的实时渲染，每次按回车时会触发渲染当前行。当然，这个实时 跟新世代编辑器字符级别的没法比，但已经足够好用了。
不仅如此，终于在 OneNote 上实现了可用级别的代码高亮，输入``` 创建代码块后，每敲一行自动着色。用过 OneNote 的都懂，之前插入代码需要诸多操作，繁琐到想摔键盘。

以及 LaTex 转换到 OneNote 原生的数学公式（不是图片）。

除此之外，还支持TOC / todo / 水平线 / 脚注 等常见的语法，直接拿已有的 markdown 内容粘贴到 OneNote 中， 然后按 F5 渲染，大概率是可以完美还原的。

 
没有美美的样式主题，怎么能算一个合格的笔记软件呢？众所周知，OneNote 本身的样式功能十分鸡肋，用户很难自定义主题，只能默默忍受一成不变的素面朝天。于是我花了好大力气，实现了解析 css 样式的功能，从此 OneNote 的笔记颜值终于能打了。

双向编辑
你可能会问：这种转换是单向的吗？我如果有一天想导出 markdown 纯文本怎么办？在我看来，原始 markdown 丢失是绝对不能接受的，所以我花了很大力气来解决这个问题：笔记中每个段落的 markdown 原文都以某种格式隐藏存储在自身之中，可以随时读取，不依赖外部文件，任意编辑也不会破坏。而且这种格式是公开透明的，只需要用 OneNote api 拿到 XML 格式的笔记内容，所有秘密一览无余。
更重要的是，渲染后的内容可以原地随意增删修改，不必再重新切换回 markdown 形态编辑；而且在导出 markdown 时，内容也会相应更新——是的，实现了双向更新。当然，如果由于某些原因，你想切换回 markdown 形态编辑，也是支持的。按 ctrl + , ，即可在编辑和预览之间切换。

结语
OneMark 目前只支持 OneNote Windows 桌面版，不支持 UWP 版本以及 Mac 版本（好消息是微软正着手将 UWP 版本的功能迁移到桌面版，以后会只保留桌面版，最近的更新频率也让广大 OneNote 使用者倍感惊喜）。官网 https://onemark.neuxlab.cn/， 欢迎大家试用反馈。
后记：我为什么选择 OneNote
有人会问：不是有很多专业的 markdown 笔记软件吗，为什么还要用 OneNote？
我个人的感悟是：我首先需要的是一个自由轻松的笔记软件，其次是 markdown。我是一个懒人，无论是日常生活，还是工作学习，都没有那么 organized，十分不擅长把东西整理并保持得井井有条。我的笔记中，有一些认真记录和思考产出的内容，但更多时候，是很随意、很碎片、很当下的信息记录。我试过，当面对一个专业的 markdown 笔记软件时，我会变得十分紧张不自在，不知道该把这些零碎、混乱的信息放到哪里。一旦产生了这种情绪，想要记录的念头也随即不了了之。
而 OneNote 简单直接的界面、清晰的笔记结构、自由的无限画布，让我使用起来没有任何心理压力。唯一的缺点就是当需要认真输出内容时，没有 markdown 这件趁手的兵器，确实有点力不从心。补齐了这点之后，对于我个人而言就别无他求了。
其实十多年前，OneNote 刚推出的时候也曾惊艳四座， 那时的设计理念和体验还是很超前的，有了现在流行的 block level 编辑器的雏形，无论是列表、段落、表格，书写和调整起来都非常得心应手。也多亏了这些设计，结合 markdown 之后居然毫不违和，整体体验下来有点现代编辑器的味道了。个中玄妙，就待各位亲自上手把玩了。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你好，我是马上要上第 700 节 CrossFit 团课的克莱尔。（但今天是我的休息日。所以我来写稿了。
如果你想减脂增肌，或者厌倦了在普通健身房对着满屋子器械不知从何下手，CrossFit 训练也许是一个最简单粗暴的健身方案。

融合有氧器械、哑铃壶铃、药球、奥林匹克举重与单杠和吊环体操动作， CrossFit 以社区感、团课、每天不重样的训练内容闻名。对，我们每天练的项目都不一样，它要求你什么都懂（一点），对心肺、力量、柔韧性等各方面都有要求。
换句话说， CrossFit 花样丰富，有趣，强度大，但作为一个相对小众的运动，准入门槛也不低。如果你在一二线城市，找到好馆子的可能性会比较大。如果你经常出差—— CrossFit 就像健身界的星巴克，无论到哪个城市，都能找到以相似模式运行的 Box ，能结识不同的朋友。
全球 CF 馆分布
今年是我练 CF 的第三年。根据三年的观察，许多来 CF 新客体验的人常被这项运动的强度或者“对新人不友好”震慑，觉得这是一馆子又壮又爱拼命的疯子。但其实 CF 并没有想象中这么吓人。在进行你的第一次 CF 训练之前，提前知道这些事情可以降低你在馆里低血糖、呕吐或者被吓得从此听到 CF 就绕道走的概率。
离你最近的 CrossFit 训练馆在哪里？
首先，如何找到离你最近的 CF 训练馆？如果你在国内一线城市，在点评 app 里输入 CrossFit 就是最快的方法，如果搜索结果中出现【综合训练】字样，它很有可能也是一个 CF 馆。只是未经 CF 官方认证。这不代表它是山寨——近几年有越来越多场馆认为自己不需要每年缴会费做这个认证，但大家训练的系统是一样的。
如果你在国外，除了谷歌，另一个方法是点进 crossfit.com 网页，在右上角 Find a gym 这里找到经过官方认证的场馆（对国内场馆同样适用，但也许网速会众所周知地慢一点）…]]></summary>

微软在 2018 年支付 75 亿美元收购了 GitHub，此后将这个代码仓库整合到其开发者工具中，同时在很大程度上采取了放手的态度。Matthew Butterick 是一名作家、律师，也是一名程序员，他认为微软基于机器学习的代码助手 GitHub Copilot 存在一些问题，它似乎不正确地对待开源代码许可证。

GitHub Copilot 是 Visual Studio 和其他 IDE 的一个插件，通过在你输入时提供代码完成的 “建议” 来运作。Codex 是该系统的动力源。然而，Butterick 等开发者认为 AI 在如何学习方面存在问题，或者更具体地说，AI 是从哪里训练的。

这里的问题是，GitHub 所训练的公开代码仓库是有许可证的，当他们的工作被利用时，需要按照许可证进行。虽然微软对其使用代码的问题一直避而不谈，称其为合理使用，但 Copilot 除了提供建议外，还能生成逐字逐句的代码部分。

根据 Codex（由微软授权）的开发者 OpenAI的说法，“Codex 是在数以千万计的公开代码仓库中训练出来的，包括 GitHub 上的代码。”微软自己也含糊地将训练材料描述为数十亿行的公共代码。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软准备正式推出 Windows 的安卓子系统

微软准备发布 Windows 的安卓子系统（WSA）的 1.0 版本，它可以运行安卓虚拟机，安卓应用就像 Windows 的应用一样运行。通过 WSA 可以运行 “50,000 个应用程序”，但是这些应用程序来自于亚马逊的应用商店，而不是谷歌的安卓商店。也就是说你找不到谷歌的安卓应用，微软的也找不到，Twitter、WhatsApp、Slack 等等都没有，只有各种游戏和一些看起来就山寨的应用。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：理论上也是可以运行其它商店的安卓应用的，但是我不明白的是，为什么微软非要和亚马逊的商店合作。




利用智能手机预测死亡风险

根据一项研究，智能手机对人们行走活动的被动监测可以用来构建健康和死亡风险的人群水平模型。研究人员利用英国生物银行项目中超过 10 万名英国人的数据进行了 16 年的研究，他们佩戴的运动传感器可以用来从短时间的步行中提取步行强度的信息。该团队仅利用传感器收集的每天 6 分钟的稳定行走数据，结合传统的人口统计学特征，就成功验证了死亡风险的预测模型。研究人员的模型预测一年后的死亡有 72% 的正确率。


消息来源：Yahoo



老王点评：所以其实我们自身的“大数据”早已经“决定”了命运？




谷歌上线软件供应链管理项目 GUAC

谷歌与花旗银行、普渡大学等合作开发了这个项目，其简称 GUAC 代表“理解工件构成的图形”。这是一个免费的工具，用于汇集许多不同来源的软件安全元数据。GUAC 有四个关键功能：连接到各种软件安全元数据的来源来收集数据；从软件的上游数据源导入各种数据；整理这些数据，将其组合成一个连贯的图谱；对照组装好的图谱，用户可以查询附属于图中实体或与之相关的元数据。


消息来源：Record



老王点评：这个项目或许可以将软件供应链管理变得科学化，但是这个事情很复杂，想要真正解决，可能还需要更多的其它措施。]]></summary>

When you launch an application on an operating system, there are certain code libraries and utility applications that your OS needs to use for that app to run. Your OS knows how to find these libraries and utilities because it has a system path, a map to common shared data that lots of apps need. Every OS has this, but users aren’t usually aware of it because they don’t usually need to care about it. However, when you start coding or using special network utilities or commands, you might care about your own PATH variable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本新手教程展示了在 Debian、Ubuntu 和其他的 Linux 发行版上如何解决 “Bash: command not found” 这一报错。


当你在 Linux 中使用命令时，你希望得到终端输出的结果。但有时候，你会遇到终端显示“命令未找到command not found”这一报错。



对于这个问题，并没有直截了当且单一的解决方案。你必须自己做一些故障排除来解决这个报错。

老实说，要解决它并不难。该报错信息已经给出了一些提示：“命令未找到”，这说明你的 shell（或者 Linux 系统）找不到你输入的那条命令。

shell（或 Linux 系统）找不到命令，有三个可能的原因：


你将命令的名称拼错了

该命令还没有安装

该命令是一个可执行脚本，但其位置未知


接下来，我们会详细介绍“命令未找到”这一报错的每一个原因。

解决“命令未找到”报错

方法 1：再次检查命令名称有没有写错

每个人都会犯错误，尤其是在打字的时候。你输入的命令可能存在错别字（也就是你写错啦）。

你应该特别注意：


是否拼对了正确的命令名称

是否在命令与其选项之间加上了空格

是否在拼写中混淆了 1（数字 1）、I（大写的 i）和 l（小写的 L）

是否正确使用了大写字母或者小写字母


看看下面的示例，因为我写错了 ls 命令，所以会导致“command not found”报错。



所以，请再次仔细确认你输入得对不对。

方法 2：确保命令已安装在你的系统上

这是“命令未找到”错误的另一个常见原因。如果命令尚未安装，则无法运行该命令。

虽然在默认情况下，你的 Linux 发行版自带安装了大量命令，但是不会在系统中预装 所有的 命令行工具。如果你尝试运行的命令不是一个流行的常用命令，那么你需要先安…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你设法在你的 Ubuntu 系统上安装了谷歌 Chrome 浏览器。现在你想知道如何让浏览器保持更新。


在 Windows 和 macOS 上，当 Chrome 上有可用更新时，你会在浏览器中收到通知，你可以从浏览器中点击更新选项。

Linux 中的情况有所不同。你不会从浏览器更新 Chrome。你要使用系统更新对其进行更新。

是的。当 Chrome 上有可用的新更新时，Ubuntu 会通过系统更新工具通知你。



你只需单击“立即安装Install Now”按钮，在被提示时输入你的帐户密码并将 Chrome 更新到新版本。

让我告诉你为什么会在系统级别看到更新，以及如何在命令行中更新谷歌 Chrome。

方法 1：使用系统更新更新谷歌浏览器

你最初是如何安装 Chrome 的？你从 Chrome 网站 获得了 deb 安装程序文件，并使用它来 在 Ubuntu 上安装 Chrome。

当你这样做时，谷歌会在你系统的源列表中添加一个仓库条目。这样，你的系统就会信任来自谷歌仓库的包。



对于添加到系统中的所有此类条目，包更新通过 Ubuntu 更新程序集中进行。

这就是为什么当 Google Chrome（和其他已安装的应用）有可用更新时，你的 Ubuntu 系统会向你发送通知。



单击“立即安装Install Now”按钮并在要求时输入你的密码。很快，系统将安装所有可升级的软件包。

根据更新偏好，通知可能不是立即的。如果需要，你可以手动运行更新程序工具并查看适用于你的 Ubuntu 系统的更新。



方法 2：在 Ubuntu 命令行中更新 Chrome

如果你更喜欢终端而不是图形界面，你也可以使用命令更新 Chrome。

打开终端，并依次运行以下命令：

sudo apt update

sudo apt --only-upgrade install google-chrome-stable


第一条命令更新包缓存，以便你的系统知道可以升级哪些包。

第二条命令 仅更新单个包，即谷歌 Chrome（安装为 google-chrome-stable）。

总结

如你所见，Ubuntu 比 Windows 更精简。你会随其他系统更新一起更新 Chrome。

顺便一提，如果你对它不满意，你可以了解 从 Ubuntu 中删除 Google Chrome。

Chrome 是一款不错的浏览器。你可以通过 使用 Chrome 中的快捷方式 来试验它，因为它使浏览体验更加流畅。

在 Ubuntu 上享受 Chrome！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[写在前面
这个标题其实已经被我修改了一下，因为一边上学一边写稿偶尔真的拖延爆炸。在这之前，其实标题是：“灵动岛到底好不好”。如今我也算是吃了豹子胆，敢直接标题下结论。虽然已经离发布会过了很多天，当时的情绪也已经逐渐稀释，还是想尽可能理性的去一点点解释，为什么不好。
我并不想在文章的一开头就给自己贴上标签，一方面是不喜欢这样的做法，另一方面也是此时的我并没有什么拿得出手的名堂。很多观点都是超级主观的，但也很高兴你能来看看！谢谢你，我的朋友！希望你看的开心！

“好不好”的尺度
对于灵动岛，我感觉我们都有着一样的一条曲折心路：发布会前被剧透难看的感叹号挖孔，发布会时被灵动岛的亮相视频惊艳到再次对苹果重拾希望，但第二天起床琢磨过劲——这也是我们出现分歧的地方：我们都想知道这究竟是另一个 Touch Bar，还是一个能定义 iPhone 接下来几年发展的新设计。
要想搞清楚这个问题，我想讲个有些偏题的故事。
来到伦敦后，一个人住一个只有17平米的房子，空虚寂寞冷的时候也会想用音乐填满自己的房间。于是就在亚马逊上看了看各种音箱。我目前使用的电脑是14寸的 MacBook Pro，但长期会连着一个明基的显示器来用，所以我对这个音箱购买就列下了几条条件：

音质不能比 mac 本身差
必须有 aux，这样我能连接显示器用，受不了蓝牙的音画不同步
能放在显示器的正下方，所以不能太大
好看，别太贵…

在网上看了一圈，我特别喜欢 Marshall 的 EMBERTON II，当时加上一点学生优惠不到100英镑就能拿下。我觉得它小巧精致，光是凭借这好看的皮囊我就快按耐不住自己的购买欲了。可是它却有一个地方不能满足我的需求，它没有 aux，纯蓝牙。当时我的内心就出现了两股力量：一股力量准备 pua 自己，让自己接受蓝牙的延迟；另一股力量开始嘲讽 Marshall 这个品牌的一些关于“音质”和“品…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我是在 Jarod 的知识星球里看到他推荐 LEX 这款在线编辑器。他问有没有人要邀请链接。我于是立即要来了一个。
实话实说，最近「玩具」有点儿多。
笔记软件，有 Tana ；浏览器，有 Arc；Readwise 新出的一站式阅读器 Reader ，也很不错。
原本，对这个新的在线编辑器，我是打算先留着，有空再仔细尝试。
但是，一进入 LEX 的界面，读了官方的介绍，我立刻就不淡定了。

其实，哪里只是我一个人不淡定啊？
Building the Second Brain 作者 Tiago Forte 说，自己已经看到要失业的迹象了。
因为，一篇文章里，他自己只写了 5 个词儿。剩下全是 AI 顺着往下编。

至于 Ali Abdaal 更是过分，他干脆搞了个「恶作剧」当成测试。好在事后，他向大家公开坦诚自己的行为。

这个几乎完全用 LEX 写就的帖子，数据表现是这样的：

当然，Ali 是名人，浏览量是有名人效应的。只不过，人工智能的作品几乎骗过了所有人的眼睛，还收获了这么多的点赞和转发，这就厉害了。
咱们别把眼睛只盯在这些大咖身上了。下面说说我自己的实际测试结果吧。红框里面的文字，是我写的：

然后后面的段落，全都是 Lex 自动补全的。
更厉害的是，根据这些内容，Lex 自动生成了若干标题，我只是从中选了一个而已。

原本 GPT-2 时代，人工智能自动补全已经大显神通了。GPT-3 的应用，就意味着写出来的东西更真假难辨了。

（图片来源：t.ly/DMxe）
原本你要用 GPT-3 ，还有一些障碍。例如说你需要获得 API 的使用权限，而且还得对每一次的调用付费。

而 LEX，至少在目前，是免费的。况且，它还是个在线编辑器。你啥都不用安装，直接打开，然后就能调用 GPT-3 帮你写东西了。

我当时就在想，这以后英语写作课的作业可怎么判呢？
好在老外开发这东西…]]></summary>

Observability-driven development (ODD) is being recognized as "necessary" for complex, microservice-based architectures. Charity Majors coined the term and has written about it in several articles, including Observability: A Manifesto. She explains the term in this quote:
Do you bake observability right into your code as you're writing it? The best engineers do a form of "observability-driven-development" — they understand their software as they write it, include instrumentation when they ship it, then check it regularly to make sure it looks as expected. You can't just tack this on after the fact, "when it's done".
OpenTelemetry provides the plumbing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近几年区块链逐渐火热以后，「去中心化」的概念逐渐受到关注。
去中心化指的是：在一个分布有众多节点的系统中，每个节点都具有高度自治的特征。
回想一下，你的各种私有资料都储存在哪里？
文档都在 WPS 的云盘，或者散落在各种文件夹中；
音频文件可能分散在网易云音乐、QQ 音乐、酷狗等等音频平台，如果你喜欢音乐的本地化，也许会下载到某个文件夹中；
至于相片这种更为私人的东西，则有可能在手机本地相册或者选择百度网盘、iCloud 等等网络云盘中。
我们经常会把同类的文件分散在各处，当我们想去寻找的时候却往往难以在一个确定的地方查询；又或者遭遇到了平台倒闭，难以取回储存在云空间中的珍贵资料。
所以对于文件的「中心化」储存和管理，是一个值得尝试的文件管理形式。
我认为其中有三个核心：集中管理、本地优先、在线引用
将「中心化」概念运用到相册管理中
比如图片的管理，拿我的个人相册举例。
我们的手机每天都会有很多图片产生：屏幕截图、自拍、风景等等照片，但并非所有的照片都值得长期保存，所以要定期清理无关照片，备份重要的相片。

我从大学时期就开始使用谷歌相册管理我的手机相片，这个堪称当下功能最强大的在线相册，会智能地自动备份相机拍下的所有照片、屏幕截图，甚至还有其他 APP 中保存的图片。同时也可以一键清理本地已备份的图片，节省手机空间。
五年多过去了，我的谷歌相册中积攒了无数张相片，其中超过一半以上的图片都是无关的废片，混杂在各种较为重要的照片中，我花了很长时间都难以删除这些图片。
于是我国庆期间我批量下载了所有的相片，大约 5w 张，其中绝大部分图片都是各种被自动备份的无关照片，经过大约三天的筛选，最终保留下了差不多 7000 多张照片。
那么问题来了，如何让我的相册不再受到污染，能够自动备份到谷歌相册中，而且我希望能够保留一份相册在本地，在我删除本地照片的时候自动在云端也删除。
我采取的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2022国庆七天，秋高气爽良辰美景怎可辜负？驾驶着 Model 3，带上小米 11 Ultra，一路向西北从惠州到桂林。

Model 3 标续版提车于2021 年 12 月，表显续航 423 公里，1.6 万公里后表显降为 418 公里。
去程全长 627 公里，途径佛山百利达广场特斯拉超充站充电一次约 15 分钟，在贺州境内高速上充电一次约 25 分钟。
佛山百利达广场特斯拉超充站选址非常好，就在高速出入口附近，上下高速很方便。贺州境内高速上的快充表现不错，功率一度飙到充电 800 km/h 以上。

提车至今对 Model 3 的续航表现基本满意，天气凉爽的情况下表显多少就能跑出多少，甚至有时候实际续航还会超出表显，不同天气状况下的真实续航表现可以看我的 B 站自驾游视频。
晚霞迎接我们一路向西
到达桂林市临桂区已是晚上 10 点 15 分左右，办好入住第一件事就是去吃一碗桂林米粉。可能因为去的是商业步行街，美食比较商业化，即使当时比较饿了，这碗粉也没有给我带来美味的感觉。

重头戏在第二天的龙脊梯田之旅。龙脊梯田位于桂林龙胜县东南部和平乡境内的龙脊山。龙脊梯田距龙胜县城27公里，距桂林市80公里，景区面积共66平方公里，梯田分布在海拔300至1100米之间，坡度大多在26至35度之间，最大坡度达50度。
从临桂区去龙脊梯田景区大门口要一个半小时左右，桂林真大啊，查了下比北京还要大 1 万多平方公里
根据疫情防控要求，散客只能在景区收费处外面的广场购票，票价 80 元/成年人，和售票处价格一致。
工作人员告知我们，双向单车道的蜿蜒的山路加上堵车，从景区售票处到龙脊梯田里的几个寨子还要差不多 1 个小时的车程。国庆期间人特别多，如果按常规路线开车去名气最大的大寨，开车到坐缆车的地方要 1 个多小时，排队花钱坐缆车还要1个多小时，工作人员收费给我们指明了一条别的路去千层天梯，美景不打折，还可以开车到达。

工作人员收费指明的这条路应该是尚未完全开发的新路，路上看到了多处没有做固化工程的山坡，不少路段有落石和滑坡泥土，还有一个地方路面塌方，行驶起来要格外小心。
使用长焦拍下这张照片，脑海里突然响起《断背山》的配乐，给人一种氛围宁静的感觉
一个多小时后终于达到千层天梯，话不多说欣赏美景吧，看看小米 11 Ultra 记录的龙脊梯田，先来一张全景图。

这张全景图是在千层天梯处拍的，当天天空中飘着淡青蓝色的烟雾，有一种烟雨朦胧的感觉，阳光洒在稻田上勾勒出明暗的分界线，小米 11 Ultra 非常好地还原了真实的色彩和光影。
当时在梯田附近一家民宿停车吃饭，两荤一素一共三个菜（牛蛙+鱼+青菜+米饭）加免费停车 120 元左右，坐在民宿楼下的台阶上吃饭吹风欣赏美景十分惬意，可以说物超所值。

使用小米 11 Ultra 以来最满意的就是它的长焦表现，镜头压缩空间集中表达内容可以拍出非常有故事感的照片。以下照片应该都是 5x-30x 范围内拍摄的（具体记不清了），画质表现超出预期，当天的良好光线也功不可没。
 后期调色套了滤镜
11 Ultra 的主摄表现不错，成片有光影层次，色彩过渡自然，数码味和锐化较少，和肉眼所见十分接近。

当然，小米 11 Ultra 拍照也不是十全十美的，成像慢、多颗摄像头切换动画生硬、逆光自拍效果一般、超级夜景容易糊等等。不过考虑到 3699 元的价格，这些问题也都可以忽略了。
最后附上一些桂林游玩期间的美图（部分有后期），推荐大家去桂林玩，一座现代和古典，先锋流行和土著闲适相结合的奇妙城市，当地人比较友善，这次去也没遇到宰客行为，花费物超所值，值得一去。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[灵动岛是今年iPhone的热点更新。我们在早期的时候，看到了很多针对灵动岛的玩法，比如在岛的周围养宠物、用灵动岛打游戏、适配灵动岛的挖孔壁纸等。
但是，这些玩法从系统和功能层面，并没有用到真正的“灵动岛接口”。在苹果开发者文档中，灵动岛实际上是一种“实时活动”。在某些用户需要实时关注状态变化的场景下，为用户展示信息。比如实时更新比赛数据、实时更新外卖进度、实时更新计时器、实时更新地图导航指引等等。
如果iPhone安装了iOS 16.1系统，在iPhone 14 Pro机型上，实时活动可以在灵动岛和锁屏界面展示；而在非iPhone 14 Pro机型，则只在锁屏界面展示。

OneWidget如何定位灵动岛？
仔细阅读苹果开发者文档之后，我们发现实时活动的实现方式和小组件有非常多重叠的地方。同时，不管在锁屏界面还是“展开的”灵动岛位置，它的尺寸都很像中尺寸的桌面小组件。再者，实时活动不能够交互、也不能有动画、不能随时刷新，这些和小组件都太像了。所以，我们最终把实时活动定位成“一种特殊的小组件”。
当我们把“灵动岛”定义为“实时展示的小组件”，那么一切就更简单了，原则上小组件能够实现的它都可以实现。只是我们需要额外思考，在锁屏和灵动岛这两个特殊的位置，用户凭什么要展开来用它。
OneWidget怎么做灵动岛功能？
在迭代产品的2年多时间里，OneWidget的各种类型的小组件从用户那里得到了很多不错的回馈。当我们复盘这些小组件，用户最关心的是三个关键词：实用、美观、趣味。所以，设计灵动岛这个特殊的小组件，我们应该做的也是实用、美观、趣味。另外补充一点，对于很多用户来说，美观、趣味也是一种实用价值，美观带来个性化的装饰、趣味带来功能的尝鲜探索。
从实用和便捷角度，我们设计了“启动之岛”和“健康之岛”。
从美观和趣味角度，我们设计了“宠物之岛”和“摆烂之岛”。

如何开启灵动岛？
如果iPhone更新到iOS 16.1以上，下载OneWidget 的3.6.0以上的版本之后，可以进入个人中心找到主入口。在灵动岛配置页面，选择需要开启的“岛屿”，当App进入后台或者切换到其他App，实时活动就已经开启在了锁屏界面和灵动岛区域。
配置入口我们还单独设计了一些细节：会动的海平面、开启后的彩色提示框、预览效果等。

宠物之岛
用户可以在“宠物之岛”领养一个自己的电子宠物，它每天陪你玩、会饿、会困、会渴，在不同的状态下用户需要点击不同的操作。我们给宠物取了一个名字叫做“岛岛”，领养之后，在App内还会显示领养的天数。岛岛除了不同的状态，也有可能会出去玩耍，只有等他回来才能再次跟他互动。为了满足个性化，宠物“岛岛”还允许自定义颜色，现在我们支持了7种颜色的切换。

启动之岛
“启动之岛”可以允许用户添加快速启动App或者小程序的入口，常驻在锁屏界面和灵动岛里，展开之后即可点击一键直达的App。用户可以添加1~6的常用启动入口，根据添加的数量变化，图标和间距会自动调整来适应合适的布局。和锁屏小组件、桌面小组件一行，这里的启动器入口支持添加常用的App、微信支付宝的二级路径、微信和支付宝的小程序入口。

摆烂之岛
“摆烂之岛”将随机展示一些“反鸡汤”的插画和文案。这个功能为了满足“趣味性”，该卷的时候卷，该躺的时候也要好好躺。偶尔摆烂无可厚非，休息是人之常情。

健康之岛
“健康之岛”实时展示用户当天的健康数据，比如步数、运动时间、消耗能量、身高、体重等。尤其是对于每日会更新变动的数据，是可以查看更新数据的（不过目前系统刷新问题，会有较多延迟）。

 
以上就是OneWidget关于灵动岛功能的思考和功能的介绍。希望帮助大家了解灵动岛，也能够帮助大家通过这些小功能体验到灵动岛（实时活动）的用法。我们将继续做好一个“装修产品”，带来更多实用、美观、有趣的功能。

An open source, self-hosted knowledge base that works with a SQLite db file.

如何还是不太清楚这个是干嘛用的，那么体验一下官方的 Demo，体验过的小伙伴一定会觉得这不就是 Flomo 吗？确实，这算是非官方 Flomo 的开源替代品，鉴于 Memos 的开源特性你可以随意的部署在自己的服务器上去使用。
Memos 的部署也很简单，一条 Docker 命令就能启动，但是对于不熟悉 Docker 的小伙伴或许还是有些难度的，为此我写了这篇入门级的教程，让小伙伴能够轻松完成 Memos 的部署。
Flomo 和 Memos 的功能对比


对比FlomoMemos
收费方式免费有限制开源自托管
API 接口Pro 版免费使用免费开放
每日回顾Pro 版支持支持
微信输入支持不支持


通过对比我认为 Memos 除了在微信输入上欠缺了一点，在其它方面是胜过 Flomo 的，虽然不能够原生的支持微信输入，但是 Memos 官方开放了 API 接口，通过这个接口去连接个人的微信服务号或许可以实现微信输入的功能，网上也有类似通过 Telegram 进行输入的教程。
 
🔞注意：本次的部署环境为： Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS

I've done a lot of writing throughout my career, mostly as an IT consultant creating product documentation as client deliverables. These documents generally provide instructions on installing various operating systems and software products.
Since 2018, I've contributed to opensource.com with articles about open source software. Of course, I use open source editors to write my pieces. Here are the four open source editors that I have used.

The Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing industries are developing quickly, and with it so does the scale of endpoints and the complexity of business logic. The more the IoT ecosystem grows, the more important it becomes to verify the availability and reliability of your platform. If you're delivering services, then testing your IoT system can help you find bottlenecks in performance, and help you plan ahead for scalability.
IoT can consist of any number of different devices using diverse protocols, strung together with complex integration architecture. This can make it challenging to design effective and meaningful tests for it. In this article, I demonstrate how to test an IoT platfor…]]></summary>

ToolJet is an open source, low-code framework for rapidly building and deploying internal tools. Our codebase is 100% JavaScript and TypeScript.
A lone developer in April 2021 started ToolJet. The public beta launched in June 2021 and was an instant hit. With this traction, ToolJet raised funding, and currently, we have a team of 20 members.
Why open source?
Before working on ToolJet, I worked with a few enterprise clients as a consultant. Many of these clients were large enough to build and maintain dozens of internal tools. Despite the constant requests from sales, support, and operations teams to add more features and fix the bugs in their internal tools, engineering teams struggled to find the bandwidth …]]></summary>

住宿&交通🚌
市区住宿：Best Western Plus Welcome Hotel Frankfurt

📍 Leonardo-da-Vinci-Allee 2, 60486 Frankfurt am Main, Germany
⏳ 入住：下午3点，退房：上午11点
🔗 https://www.bestwestern.de/

这家宾馆距离机场十几分钟的车程，和市中心罗马广场也是差不多的距离。宾馆的旁边有超市，可以购买水果和零食。宾馆的马路对面就是轻轨车站，可以乘坐17路去往市区，换乘地铁可以到达罗马广场，交通还算便利。如果是在入住时间前到达的宾馆，可以先把行李寄存在一楼。运气好的话，有房间空出来的时候，也可以在早晨就办理入住。
和宾馆相隔一个街区，就是一个公园。公园的入口处有几家小餐馆。公园里有篮球场，能看到很多青少年在玩儿街头篮球，也有不少推着婴儿的家庭来这里活动。
从房间往外看，能看到金融区的高楼大厦
小镇住宿：PK Parkhotel Kurhaus

📍 Kurhausstraße 28, 55543 Bad Kreuznach, Germany
⏳ 入住：下午3点，退房：上午11点
🔗 http://www.parkhotelkurhaus.com/

Bad Kreuznach是距离法兰克福约一小时车程的一个温泉镇，也是很多人们来度假的地方，所以宾馆不少。PK Parkhotel Kurhaus是一家四星级宾馆，但不巧的是入住的时候宾馆正在翻新，遇到了暖气不热等问题。这家宾馆毗邻一条河，附近有一座建于中世纪的桥，是个散步的好去处。

这篇文章阐述了我认为以 Surface 为代表的 Windows 平台笔记本的通病，提供了一些不成功的解决方案，并展示更换到 MacBook 后的使用体验。

如果你和我一样是一名研究生，日常工作内容主要是阅读文献、写论文（撰写 Latex 代码）、写代码以及做 PPT。读完这篇文章，也许你想试试使用 MacBook Pro 继续你的工作
如果你被近期新发布的 Surface 系列笔记本吸引，正在持币观望，不妨读完这篇文章再决定是否入手最新的 Surface 系列

为什么倒戈来得这么晚
我的软粉生涯开始于 2015 年，彼时 Surface Pro 4 发布。全新的二合一形态笔记本让我觉得手里的 MacBook Air 瞬间不香了。2016 年，拿到大学录取通知书的那天晚上，我下单了一台 Surface Pro 4，从此开始了我的 7 年 Surface 使用生涯。在这期间有无数理由让我不再使用 Surface 系列， 而让我留下的理由只有一个——迷人的外观。
最开始购买了一台丐版 Surface Pro 4，在我大二转入计算机专业后，这台 Surface Pro 4 的性能就捉襟见肘了。 于是我将它换成了一台顶配的 Surface Book 1。这台 Surface Book 1 伴随了我 5 年多的时间，更换过一次屏幕，两次底座（均为内部电池发生鼓包）。在日常使用时，这台电脑经常发热（有时候合上盖子风扇也不停），时不时还会出现…]]></summary>

本着不在路上花过多时间，并且要最大化个人生活空间的原则，我选择租公司附近两公里范围内的一室户，这不可避免地限制了我的很多租房想法。除去价格不菲的商用公寓和城中村，几乎就已经没有其他的选项，所以选来选去，只能做出妥协，定了一个小区里的公寓楼。
户型状况
我租到的是一室一厅的户型，但这栋公寓都有一个致命的缺点——客厅不见光。没有办法，租房不可能样样完美，考虑到白天几乎都在工作，周末和假期也尽可能逼迫自己出门浪而不是在家里发霉，所以也就勉强接受了这个缺陷。总的来说，这个户型面积相对可观，除了一些无法改动的分区（例如卫生间和厨房），其余还是有很多空间可以利用。
我家的简单户型图
室内状况
这栋公寓大多数房源，都归属于几个来深圳避寒的东北大姐，难得我这间的房东是一个系那个对年轻的国企深二代。但房东自己并不是一个乐于布置的人，房间里大多数的设施都是为了方便他做铲屎官，所以除了还算认真地定制了柜子、装了电视以及摆了一个还能用的沙发。
总的来说，租来的状况仅仅是个凑活，对我而言还远远不能达到拎包入住的状态。好在我个人也有一些从上一个家带来的“资产”，和一些软装的小计划，因此这个水平也刚好给了我一些发挥的空间。于是，漫漫“…]]></summary>

欢迎评论区友好讨论。虽然都是些浅短的认识，但是分享出来也算是一种体验，非常感谢大家的观看和意见。

大家好我是车不能快，一个有点闲的键盘爱好者，很高兴和大家再次见面。这次开启了一个新栏目《键微知著》，这个栏目主要是分享一些我自己对于跟键盘有关的想法和看法，比较主观，所以观看的时候还望大家海涵 ，不过这个栏目的更新频率不会太高，因为确实比较需要时间去沉淀，也算是我玩键盘留下的一些痕迹。
切入正题，今天就来讲讲前段时间异军突起的小众配列——Alice。

FOFO拍摄
想必这把键盘大家都不会陌生，Spring这把键盘在今年可谓是「声名远扬」，凭借优秀的手感表现成功突围，同时也带动了Alice这个小众配列再次火了一把，连量产环境都受到了一定的影响，出现了许多量产的Alice键盘以供玩家选择。
例如：akko Alice、 Keychron Alice、FEKER Alice等

SnVittarius 拍摄 akkoAlice

feker Alice
第一眼看到Alice键盘的感觉是「怪异」，对于变形的抗拒、对于传统的坚守，是的，说来惭愧，作为一个客制化的玩家，很多时候我还是秉持着传统的观念去看待这些新奇的产品，不过我觉得这也是客制化对我最大的意义所在，有机会去尝试这些新鲜事物，思想上也能从传统保守的观念束缚中得以抽身。都什么年代，还在玩传统键盘？
然而在经过将近一年的使用之后，我对于Alice配列的疑惑不减反增。这个配列好在哪？为什么会有这么多的玩家能接受和使用它？
回头看，那些曾经贴在它身上的标签「人体工学键盘」、"裂开的键盘"、「独具美感的键盘」，究竟哪些词汇形容这把键盘最为贴切？
为了寻找答案，我开始了漫长的搜寻之旅，敲击着手上的Alice配列，答案仿佛就在指尖。

当我们介绍Alice配列时，印象最为深刻的点是什么？

The ability to react quickly and adapt to changing situations is critical in today's business and work environment. In the past, offering efficient, standardized systems was the way to reduce costs and provide more to the public. In today's rapidly changing world, that's not enough. Collaborating, deciding, and executing quickly on a project requires that the traditional organization chart change to strengthen adaptability, transparency, collaboration, inclusivity, and project community—all five Open Organization Principles. Today, there are too many interdependencies to stick to the traditional top-down organization chart.

Mon, 10/17/2022 - 03:00

            
The open source roots of DevOps tools are undeniable, even with a prediction that the global DevOps market will reach $17.8 billion by 2026. The changing world of work, security, and compliance concerns, along with venture capital firms, are pushing the market to DevOps platforms where development teams can access a complete end-to-end DevOps toolchain in the cloud.
The current state of open source DevOps tools
Let's get one thing straight: There's no way open source tools will disappear from the DevOps world. Right now, there's a balance between open source and vendor DevOps tools, with developers using what works for them. Indeed, there are plenty of cases when a development team chooses an ope…]]></summary>

切入正题，本篇专栏来讲讲我最近自己入手的一套的键帽——
《繁文生肖》

来自IC
说实话这套键帽一开始并没有引起我的注意，因为热升华的PBT键帽在色彩表现力上是远不如二色成型工艺的键帽。但在我往下翻阅的时候，渲染图直接抓住了我的心。

IC
毫无疑问，这是第一套有繁体中文字根设计的键帽，并且确实是超出常规的设计，可以说手套哥的设计水准确实不是盖的。

打样
但随之而来的就是几个问题在我心头萦绕。

1·工艺问题
本次代工是高端键帽大厂DOMIKEY。对于dmk的实力和做工，我是非常认可的，但问题在于，这是dmk的第一套pbt热升华键帽，此前他们从未有生产过热升华键帽，虽然在我的前一篇科普关于热升华工艺键帽我个人的一些理解 - 哔哩哔哩 (bilibili.com)已经简略介绍了一些有关于PBT热升华的知识，但是这些只是纸上谈兵罢了，高端热升华键帽之所以是高端热升华，是因为随着价格的提升，消费者的要求也随之提升——遮光性、字符清晰度、手感、键帽弯曲等等瑕疵不能出现。如果价格来到了这个价位，那么这些要求我认为也是合情合理的。
2·价格问题
厂虎的价格是499小全套，个性纹样129。这个价格，真心不算低了，即便是目前所谓的顶级热升华键帽CRP,价格也是600目前涨价之后。DOMIKEY第一次做热升华键帽，便开出如此顶级的价格，虽然是比二色要便宜一些，但热升华的成本并不算高，这么看来dmk应该是对于自己工艺非常有信心，并且有着对这套键帽设计极高的预期。事实证明，他的确押对宝了。
这套限时不限量的键帽在三天的开车预售时间内卖出了800+的惊人成绩。同时再一次证明了我的观点，买…]]></summary>

作为 macOS 用户，本地音乐管理一直是我感到头疼的问题。虽然大部分时间都在 macOS 系统下，但我目前的音乐资料库，是在 Windows 系统上使用 Musicbee 整理而成，文件夹结构是：歌手/专辑/单曲，并且自定义了各类的播放列表（m3u 格式），这些内容都通过群晖 NAS 在各个设备上同步。
资料库中大部分是从 CD 导入，这样做的好处是可以很容易的抓取正确歌曲名，轨道信息及专辑封面等内容。网上下载的音乐信息会相对混乱，但在导入时我也会手动进行整理，因此资料库 90% 以上的音乐经过整理、拥有专辑封面。
macOS 中不管是曾经的 iTunes 或现在的 Apple Music 都不支持直接导入 Flac 格式文件，需要转换成 ALAC 或者 WAV 格式才能使用，非常繁琐。给我心中埋下了需要寻找全新应用的种子。
而在没有寻找本地音乐软件前，我使用 Audio Station ——群晖官方提供的音乐套件。在 iOS 上也有对应的 app 可以访问资料库在线播放。但 Audio Station 并没有桌面软件，只能通过浏览器访问，不是很方便，同时远程访问音乐难免会遇到网络问题，总没有直接存储在本地来的方便。
Audio Station 网站截图
于是我希望找到一个好用的音乐软件来解决这些问题，总结来说，我对它有这几点畅想：

可以导入指定位置音乐文件，并无需复制至其他位置，或打乱原有文件顺序；
兼容大部分常见的音乐格式；
可以导入 m3u 格式的播放列表，并且正确关联音乐文件；
优美的界面展示，可以显示专辑封面；
合理…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[每个创业者的目标都是成功退出，而传统的退出路径包括IPO上市，或者被并购。
TechCrunch的一项调查显示，创业公司从成立到成功退出的平均时长接近6年。
各地区从创业到退出年限的平均数、中位数
这无疑增加了创业门槛，意味着一旦选择创业，需要6年时间才能收获结果。这尤其对奉行精益创业理念的小微创业企业（Micro Startup）或者超级个体不友好，导致这些创业者要么继续做大直到退出，要么慢慢变成一个“副业”。
你可能会问，做大有什么不好？有的创业者适合指挥千军万马，而有的创业者更擅长抓住每一个灵感闪现。例如，以色列号称Startup Nation，大批创业者完成产品0-1搭建后就把公司卖给大企业，然后继续投入新的创业中，反而坚持做大到IPO的比较少，这与以色列的市场规模和地理位置有关。
所以，不断降低创业者成功退出的门槛，让专注创新的创业者持续创新，让擅长增长的创业者不断增长，对激活创业生态至关重要。
为小微创业者提供便捷、低门槛的推出服务，已成为海外SaaS创业中一个重要的细分方向。海外正在兴起一批相关的平台，但国内却还没有对应的趋势，值得国内创业者们分析和借鉴。
Flippa：最大的数字资产交易平台
Flippa成立于2009年，现在已经是全球第一大的数字资产交易平台，有超过300万注册用户，可以交易的资产包括网站、app、域名、网店、自媒体账号、甚至是SaaS应用等等——这也正是广大微创业或超级个体们最活跃的领域。
Flippa在售的个人网站
与传统的二手商品相比，数字资产交易最大的挑战一是如何估值，二是如何保障信息的真实性。
Flippa平台为卖家提供了一个估值机器人工具，它的算法参考多个因素，包括卖家所售业务模式、运营时间、绩效表现、增长率、类别等。卖家在上传商品时，也需要提供近12个月的运营数据。
Flippa也提供尽职调查的服务，卖家可以选择授权买家查看他…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我是如何选择应用的
我的工作流与其他少数派作者相比起来，简直是小巫见大巫了。我并没有独特的电脑技巧，也没有什么私藏的应用。我所得知的应用都基本上是通过少数派的派评系列文章。不过，当我尝试了一些app之后，有好有坏，也花了不少冤枉钱。所以，有时候我都想开一个叫“持续追踪”的栏目以专门反馈后续各个应用的使用情况和想法。
在我苦哈哈地写完小米那篇文章之后，我非常反感那些不稳定且复杂的系统，而且也花了不少冤枉钱，尝到了很多功能繁复且声称能达到很多种效果的应用。我不知道 all-in-one 是什么时候开始的，又是什么时候流行的。
在一些工具群或者相关话题的评论区，提到效率工具，大部分网友都会all in one变成使自己“效率”标签存在的信仰，而对那些没有 all-in-one 的工具嗤之以鼻。这正是令我一直感到奇怪的事情。All-in-one 是否不仅仅只限于工具？如果仅限于工具，这是否未免有些太过工具理性了？我认为，工具的 all-in-one 反倒是弱化了使用者的存在，而为这些工具服役。手机就是一个典型的例子。
另外，从行为学的角度来说，一个东西仅对我产生一个刺激，是最有效的学习方案。在这里，我不想深入探讨行为学背后的各种复杂和千丝万缕的概念，而只是利用两个最基本的概念：一个是桑代克的刺激-反应理论（S-R theory), 即学习是刺激和反应相关联的结果。简单来说，就是培养习惯。
另一个是斯金纳的 Discriminative stimuli，即一种能产生特定反应的刺激，且这种反应更加迅速，不会被轻易替换和消退。这也是我为什么讨厌all in one应用的原因，因为他们的刺激无法令我快速的形成或者产生相对应的刺激。所以，他们大大地降低了我的效率。
所以，为了让自己以后不再花冤枉钱，我为生产力或者效率软件做出了三个规则：

简洁：不简单，美观
易用：用起来不是很复杂，上手简单…]]></summary>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

从 iPhone X 开始，每年我都会为新的 iPhone 写一篇操作指南，一晃已经到了 iPhone 14 系列。在过去的几年里，智能机的影像理念无论是大方向还是品牌的个性化都在发生着翻天覆地的变化，iPhone 自然也是如此。不过 iPhone 更为难得的是一种在变化和不变中的把控。
是的，不变。
在我看来，「不变」比「变化」更能考验一款产品对于影像技术发展的思考与判断。不过，这个问题我想留在最后再讨论。
使用 iPhone 14 Pro 系列拍摄
相比评测，这篇操作指南我会更多分享我使用 iPhone 14 系列的创作经验。过去的一段时间里，我们使用 iPhone 14 系列拍摄了大量不同主题、不同风格的作品，其间也围绕今年的重要更新——4800 万像素——做了大量探索和尝试。
使用 iPhone 14 Pro Max 拍摄
许多惊喜，当然也有一点问题。我们就先从 4800 万像素带来的第一个改变，50mm 开始。
（注：受平台上传图片大小限制，文章照片均经过压缩。）
延续的系统，新增的焦距
一个重要的逻辑是，当我们谈论手机摄影时，本质上应该把手机作为「相机」在讨论。换言之，无论是相机还是手机，当我们在拍摄时，指导我们的再也不是所谓的参数，而是摄影理念本身。
iPhone 14 Pro 系列 1× 镜头拍摄iPhone 14 Pro 系列 3× 镜头拍摄
对于焦距的认知就是一个最好的例子。
本质上任何的相机都是由机身和镜头两部分组成，其中镜头直接影响着你的取景范围。而取景范围意味着「拍摄题材的选择」。从 iPhone 11 …]]></summary>
