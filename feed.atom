As you remember the Vite configuration had a nasty “test” section which had to define the “inline” dependencies, which indicated that there’s a gap there and this is a mere patch for the time being. 
After I published that post I was reached out by Alex Lohr (@lexlohr) who pointed my attention to this GitHub thread which basically offers a solution to the issue behind these lines in Vitest configuration:

So far, ownCloud users have only had the opportunity to choose between simple local file storage based on a POSIX-compatible file system or EOS Open Storage (EOS). The latter causes massive complexity during setup. More recent versions of ownCloud feature a functionality called Decomposed FS. This file system is supposed to bring oCIS to arbitrary storage backends and even scalable ones.
During the rewrite of ownCloud from PHP to Go, the company behind the private cloud solution is introducing massive changes to the backend of the software. This time, the developers do away with a tedious requirement of the first versions of ow…]]></summary>

After you merge a GitLab or GitHub pull request, you usually delete the topic branch in the remote repository to maintain repository hygiene. However, this action deletes the topic branch only in the remote repository. Your local Git repository also benefits from routine cleanup.
To synchronize the information in your local repository with the remote repository, you can execute the git prune command to delete the local reference to a remote branch in your local repository.

Vampire Survivors’ new 0.10.0 update adds a cheats menu, and after using it to unlock some things I had been stuck on, I dearly wish that more games included one.
Vampire Survivors, if you haven’t heard of it, is a delightful game about leveling up and destroying literally thousands of monsters in a single run. I’d describe it as roguelike-ish; you pick a starting character with certain attributes and a specific weapon, and you’ll level up that weapon, other weapons, and other items as you collect gems by defeating enemies. Your weapons fire automatically, so you mostly just have to worry about picking up experience and items while avoiding baddies. 
The game launched in Early Access on Steam late last year, and has received regular...

A jury has ordered conspiracy broadcaster Alex Jones to pay $4.1 million to the parents of a child killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The decision followed a trial that saw Jones and his counsel break courtroom protocol and — at one point — accidentally send copies of Jones’ phone records to the opposing legal team. The fine marks one of the first concrete legal consequences for Jones’ false claims that the shooting was a staged “false flag,” which led to years of harassment for parents. But it represents only a fraction of the money Jones has made in the years since.
Scarlett Lewis and Neil Heslin, whose son Jesse Lewis was one of the 20 children killed at Sandy Hook, had requested $150 million in compensation for...

Other than “turning up the heat a little bit” on Meta employees who shouldn’t be there and hitting the metaverse runway, Mark Zuckerberg is highlighting Instagram’s expanded NFT support. The founder and CEO took the opportunity of announcing expanded NFT support on Instagram to tell everyone his custom-made 1992 Little League baseball card is going on sale soon, with an NFT included as part of the deal.
I thought he was minting it himself, but as the Metropolis Comic Collect profile linked in his post explains, that is not the case. This card is one Zuckerberg custom-made for a camp counselor who kept it, and now it has been authenticated and put up for sale as an actual collectible, in addition to the digital blockchain receipt.

Backstory
About a year ago, we launched on Product Hunt, introducing a new way for businesses to crowdsource video by simply sharing a link to a prompt and getting videos in response. Our customers told us again and again that they wanted to add post-production to the footage they collected, without hiring a video editor. So we built Capsule Studio, and we’re really excited to share it with you today. With Studio, you can trim, brand, personalize, and export video for any platform in minutes — all from your browser.

So I don’t know entirely what’s in Elon Musk’s counterclaims against Twitter — they are still under seal — but I did get an inkling today, when Twitter dropped its response. It’s spicy! Rather than let Musk get his complaints out first, Twitter went ahead and released a blow-by-blow response, the better with which to dunk on Elon along the way.
I do love this:
The Counterclaims are a made-for-litigation tale that is contradicted by the evidence and common sense

Usually legal documents have arcane, passive-aggressive digs at the other party in them. Twitter’s lawyers, however, came out swinging in their reply to Musk’s counterclaims. Maybe that’s because they know how many people will read these documents; maybe it’s just because they’re...

With more people working from home than they used to, owning a good pair of noise-canceling headphones has become more appealing than ever. However, they can be expensive and difficult to shop for due to the range of available models, many of which cater to different lifestyles and priorities. Some are better suited for long-haul flights, for instance, while others are ideal for multitasking and marathon listening sessions.
That’s why we’ve curated this list of the best deals on noise-canceling headphones. Here, you’ll find sales on all kinds of on-ear and over-ear headphones, all of which are designed to eliminate outside noise but come with their own strengths and weaknesses. And if you want to do even more research before making a...

HBO Max isn’t dead...yet. But come the summer of 2023 it will be, and there will be a new service replacing both HBO Max and Discovery Plus, Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav said on an earnings call today.
“HBO Max has a competitive feature set, but it has had performance and customer issues,” Zaslav said, being much more polite than I would be about the app, which regularly struggles to stream when people tune in for big appointment shows like Euphoria and Succession. He went on to claim Discovery Plus has a better tech stack and would become the core of the new service which will combine the content of HBO Max with the content and tech of Discovery Plus.

You may remember our friends at AMC, the theater chain with the pantless CEO, who’ve leaned all the way in on the meme stock thing. Hordes of enthusiastic retail investors maybe rescued AMC from crushing debt. Now AMC is hoping to tap them again to create more shares of the company.
This quarter, AMC announced a dividend for shareholders: AMC Preferred Equity units, which will trade as APE on the New York Stock Exchange. One of these babies will exist for every common share, and can be converted to common stock if the company and investors vote for that to happen.
That “if” is kind of sticky though. See, AMC wanted to sell more shares and was shot down by investors. Maybe those investors didn’t want to be further diluted — AMC sold a lot...

Employees affected would be notified over the next several days.
“Today’s change positions SoundCloud for the long run and puts us on a path to sustained profitability,” Weissman wrote in the memo. “We have already begun to make prudent financial decisions across the company and that now extends to a reduction to our team.” In a statement to Billboard, a SoundCloud representative confirmed the news, and said: “During this difficult time, we are focused on providing the support and resources to...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[龙芯指 RISC-V 不能实现自主，坚持自研指令集

龙芯之前基于 MIPS 指令，去年开始推自研的 “龙芯架构” 指令集，号称 100% 自主。龙芯公司日前称，公司创立之初就认识到基于 x86 或者 ARM 不能建立自主体系，而 MIPS 指令系统相对比较开放。但 2019 年 MIPS 开源后又闭源的事件，公司认识到基于 MIPS 也无法建立自主生态。而对于最近几年很受欢迎的 RISC-V 开源指令集，龙芯认为基于 RISC-V 同样不能构建自主生态体系，RISC-V 架构指令条数较少，比较适合学术研究以及物联网应用，商业应用会需要增加更多的指令，因此龙芯坚持自主研发指令集。

老王点评：我坚持认为 RISC-V 开源指令集才是未来。




单核计算机一小时破解了一种抗量子加密算法

美国国家标准技术局（NIST）最近宣布了后量子加密和签名算法竞赛的首批获胜者。一种名为 SIKE 抗量子加密候选算法曾进入了第四轮评选，它是一种基于 Isogeny 的算法。鲁汶大学的一个团队发表论文称，他们在一台单核计算机上耗时一个小时获取了 SIKE 使用的加密密钥。SIKE 算法的发明人承认这出乎意料。


消息来源：ARS Technica



老王点评：在量子计算还没有真正实用之前就妄想创造抗量子计算的算法，我觉得有些有些想的简单了。谁能肯定量子计算机就只能做到我们目前以为的那些事情呢，就像计算机刚刚发明之初，谁能想到如今整个世界都跑在计算机之上呢。




Fedora 37 正式支持树莓派 4

Fedora 工程和指导委员会已经确认了对树莓派 4 的“官方”支持。之前，树莓派 4 没有成为 Fedora 工作站的重点，是因为各种补丁没有被上游化，比如开源 3D 图形驱动没有上游化到内核中。现在，虽然这些上游化的工作还在进行中，但 Fedora 37 将可以提供对树莓派 4B 以及树莓派 400 和 CM4 计算模块的支持。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：之前 Pop!_OS 22.04 已经为树莓派 4 提供了支持，而 Fedora 37 也紧随其后，这都是这些驱动进入了上游后的成果，所以，真正推动 Linux 发展的的引擎，还是 Linux 内核啊。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
南京自古以来都是「国家历史文化名城」，高铁通车以后，南京更是来自安徽的朋友们求学、工作的热门目的地，所以南京又有了「徽京」这一玩味的美誉。想必这也是我经常被问及：「你当初为什么选择去合肥而不是南京」这一问题的主要原因。
或许比起南京这样能够轻松勾起读者画面感的城市而言，合肥的存在感就低得多了。想必若非特殊的原因的话，假期出游或者是计划一场旅行，大家一般不会首选这样「少有话题性」城市作为目的地。
城市通勤，总能收到来自合肥地铁三号线的「祝福」
在合肥工作生活的一年半，我也从未踏足徽州诸如黄山、淮南、芜湖（此处应有感叹号）等地的风景名胜，也没走过合肥热门的包公园、步行街、逍遥津、合柴1972；而是乘着地铁、骑着小车走遍了合肥市不少算得上人迹罕至的角落。写到最后发现比起城市景观和风光，合肥最美的还是人和事儿；若您到访合肥，不妨轻装而行，感受这些小地方的「方寸之间，自有天地」。
但如果您准备启程前往合肥工作或求学，那恭喜你来到了可能是「最美的」城市，如标题所说的：

愿您在合肥找到「平静」。

在合肥：「不游山，不玩水」
大蜀山下｜烧烧香、钓钓鱼
爬「大蜀山」似乎是属于热爱运动的合肥朋友们，周末相约的日常。但本就不爱运动，又迷恋那什么疯狂星期四的朋友们，或许会选择一些相对柔和的方式寻访大蜀山。
烧香的时候，南山寺的大师傅有说最好不要正面拍菩萨，所以这是网图。
位于大蜀山脚下的开福禅寺，是公交和地铁能够轻松到达的位置，随着2001年市政府在毁于日军侵华战火的遗址中重建以来，开福寺一直燃着本地居民「期盼平安」的香火。虽说是依山而建，开福寺对于膝盖和肥宅（指我自己）还算友好，从大门走到最高处的主殿也不过是爬七八层楼的高度。
票价不过20元，不过都会顺手买上几炷平安香。
我算不上信佛，但是会双手合十迈过寺庙的门槛，以及每个月领了工资都会去烧上一炷香。人未必要相信宗教，但得有除了「财务…]]></summary>

学术生活苦海无涯，难免会遇到几个小组作业，比如：撰写一篇综述、进行一次汇报（Pre）等。在当今疫情的背景下，小组作业也大多以线上的形式开展。收集资料、小组讨论、头脑风暴、论文撰写......在多次合作中，我尝试了多种工具并构建了自己的小组作业工作流。
从资料收集到论文撰写，下面这些工具覆盖了小组合作的全流程。用好这些工具，也许能够让小组合作的过程事半功倍。
资料收集
Zotero 群组文库：一起搭建文献库
无论是做汇报还是写综述，论文的收集和阅读往往是极为重要的一环。一个共享的文献库可以让资料收集的过程效率更高，并且在后续论文写作中也会更加方便。例如：在使用 Better BibTeX 插件来快速引用论文时，所有人的 Citation Key 都会保持一致，以免出现由于 Key 不一致导致的同一篇文献被多次重复引用的问题。
Zotero 是一款被广泛使用的文献管理软件。Zotero 除了最为常见的个人文库之外，还提供了群组文库功能。它的使用与普通的个人文库用法几乎完全一致，你在文库中做的任何修改都会被实时同步到其他人的设备上。
Zotero 群组文库功能
创建一个共享文库也十分简单。只需要前往 Zotero 官网 就可以新建一个群组。在新建完成后，只需要输入其他用户的 Zotero 账户邮箱即可发送邀请。
新建 Zotero 群组文库
easyScholor：文献期刊等级查询
为了保证参考文献的质量，老师有时会要求作业中所引用的论文需要达到一定的标准，例如必须是 SCI/EI 收录等。并且，不同学校对期刊的认定标准还可能不同。为了保证所有人在收集的文献都符合要求，可以尝试使用 easyScholor 这款浏览器插件。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这份指南中，我们将看到 Dockerfile 的简要介绍以及如何在 Linux 中使用 Dockerfile 来自动的 创建自定义 Docker 镜像 。

什么是 Dockerfile ？

Dockerfile 是附有构建 Docker 镜像说明的易于理解的文本文件。它囊括了用户在创建镜像时可以调用的所有命令。

我们可以使用 Dockerfile 创建自定义的镜像。可以通过 Docker Hub 分享的自定义 Docker 镜像。

如果你还不知道，Docker Hub 是 Docker 提供的托管存储库服务，用于团队查找和共享容器镜像，当然世界上任何人也都可以访问。

想象一下，早期如果我们想用 Nginx，我们要通过很多步骤，才能安装和配置好 Nginx 。得益于 Docker Hub ，现在我们可以在几分钟内，下载并运行 Nginx 的预置容器镜像。



运行如下命令从 Docker Hub 上拉取 Nginx 镜像：

# docker pull nginx


一旦我们拉取了 Docker 镜像，可以运行如下命令使用它：

# docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 nginx


就这样，十分简单！

参考下方链接，了解更多使用 Docker 的方式：


开始使用 Docker


Docker Hub 上有超过十万个来自软件供应商、开源项目以及社区的容器镜像。

你可以从 Docker Hub 上下载你选择的镜像，并且使用上面的命令开始使用它。

理解 Dockerfile 格式

Docker 可以读取 Dockerfile 中的 指令 来自动的创建镜像。

典型的 Dockerfile 包含如下指令：

1、FROM —— 这会设置容器的基础镜像。

例如：

第一步是更新本地包仓库缓存，以便你的系统知道有新版本的软件包可用。

sudo apt update


这是可选的。查看一下你要升级的软件包是否在 可升级软件包列表 中。

apt list --upgradable


如果所需的软件包有可用的新版本，你可以选择使用以下命令仅升级该单个软件包：

sudo apt install --only-upgrade package_name


如果你对已安装的软件包运行 apt install 命令，它将升级到下一个可用版本。

但如果该软件包尚未安装，apt 命令也会安装它。

这就是为什么 --only-upgrade 部分是必要的。使用该选项，apt 命令只会升级已安装的软件包。如果尚未安装，它将不会安装该软件包。

这不是最适合 Ubuntu 服务器用户的示例，但你仍然可以在下面的截图中看到我如何只升级了七个可升级包中的一个。



仅升级选定的软件包

如果要升级选定的几个软件包，那么不必一一更新。只需使用前面提到的命令提供包名称。

sudo apt install --only-upgrade package1 package2 package3


这是一个例子。



总结

当你面临必须升级选定软件包的情况时，你可以使用带有 –only-upgrade 选项的 apt install 命令。

我建议阅读 如何更有效地使用 apt 命令。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们总结了 Linux Mint 21 “Vanessa” 的 10 大特色，你可以看看有哪些是为你而准备的。




Linux Mint 21 “Vanessa” 是 Linux Mint 的第 36 个发布版本，它带来了一系列特色，以及对桌面上的有用改善。这些特色散落在 Cinnamon 桌面、内核变化、Xapps 更新等处。

我在这份 Linux Mint 21 的重要特色列表对它们做了个总结。

Linux Mint 21 “Vanessa” 的重要特色



1、Ubuntu 22.04 及其相关更新

也许最重要的变化就是 Linux Mint 21 的基础了，它现在基于 Ubuntu 22.04 “Jammy Jellyfish” 。上一次的主要版本，即 Linux Mint 20 “Ulyana” ，是基于四年前发布的 Ubuntu 20.04 “Focal Fossa” 。沧海桑田，现在与 2020 年的世界已然完全不同。

因此，大量的软件包、版本升级、新的性能改善 —— 所有的这些底层更新都来到了 Linux Mint 21 。这包括最新的长期支持的 Linux 内核 5.15 ，这带来了更多硬件系列的支持、以及针对编程、开发和网络的工具链的更新。

2、Timeshift 备份工具的重大变化

几个月前，Mint 开发团队 宣布 ：他们将接管著名的备份工具 Timeshift，并将其作为一个 “XApps” 继续开发。这是一个重大变化。你可能会问为什么？

好吧，Timeshift 工具的开发者 Tony George 正忙于其它的项目。你可能听说过 Linux 的 “TeeJeeTech” 应用。它是由 Tony 创建的，并且有一些很酷的应用。因此，他没有足够多的时间来专注于 Timeshift 的开发和改进。

工作日丢办公室，周末带回去，出门也有公用电脑，用着倒也还行。年初家里宽带升级，抱着电脑楼上楼下测速，便携性差这一劣势大大展现出来了，再看到 Intel 12 代酷睿性能提升巨大，所以换掉这台“便携式台式机 ”，选一台“便携式笔记本”，一番对比后选择了幻 16 。
日常使用体验
我选购的是 i9-12900H + RTX 3080Ti 顶配版本，使用了三个月中有失望也有惊喜。幻 16 机身黑色比较低调，整机 2.0 KG，对比 ThinkBook 16 的 1.8 KG 稍重，比 MacBook 16 的 2.1 KG 稍轻，久经考验如我自然觉得轻的不行。幻 16 的游戏元素较少，加上之后的性能表现，它更像全能本而不是游戏本。

幻 16 搭载一块 2560 * 1600 165 Hz 高刷新率屏幕，屏幕顶部有 IR 红外摄像头，支持 Windows Hello 面部识别，无论白天黑夜都可以快速识别进入桌面，幻 16 也可以单手开合，这些配合 新型待机（Modern Standby1）体验相当好，开盖唤醒解锁一气呵成，可以媲美 iPhone ，比起俺游戏本要从休眠中再唤醒不知道高到哪里去。
手机拍出的红外光还蛮酷炫
屏幕显示效果也不错，如果分辨率再高些就更好了，那样能开 200% 缩放获得更好显示效果。幻 16 在日常使用还是相当静音安静的，键盘手感不错，而且触摸板面积很大堪可一用，配备了 90 Wh 的大电池续航还可以，在 4~6 小时间。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当一个作家在书写「写作」时，无论 TA 是有心还是无意，关于写作的一切都会被暴露。寻着蛛丝马迹，你可以在文章里找到同样困扰自己的问题，有心的读者或许还就能在字里行间里找到自己的答案。
我一直对作家的对话访谈录更感兴趣。它们犹如窥视镜，让我管中窥豹「到底何为作家般的生活」？ TA 们的生活，是只有阅读和写作吗？TA 们描述的故事如此精彩，那故事之外的故事又是什么样的？
埃莱娜·费兰特是一位几乎不抛头露面的作家。除了必要的文学作品，她对表达自己的态度和观点相当吝啬。她是毛姆的另一个极端。我对她的兴趣始于《碎片》，但《碎片》未能完全喂食我的好奇。所以《偶然的创造》发表之后，我再一次让自己掉入了她的世界。不过这一次，我想知道的问题很明确：费兰特的写作，是什么样的？
 为什么是写作？
写作，对于一个作家来说是什么？华莱士会把它描述为「瘾」，没有这个出口，身心的某处机能就会出现故障。这种瘾在费兰特这儿，被描述为「必要的写作」：出版可以延缓，但写作刻不容缓。想写作的人一定要写作。1
如果给写作这事儿做 SWOT 分析的话，费兰特的四象限里，弊那一栏几乎可以填满：害怕交稿；害怕要在不想写的情况下写作；害怕写出的文章冒犯到读者；害怕作品没有尽善尽美就草草收场；害怕失去信心；害怕放弃。但其他三栏，费兰特只列了一条：好奇心。最后我的好奇心占了上风。2
有没有觉得似曾相识？同样的事《老友记》里的 Ross 也做过，他在 Rachel 和 Jolie 之间摇摆不定，他列出了一长串 Rachel 的毛病，但最后优点他也只列了一条：因为她是 Rachel。纵使写作有千万种让你惧怕的理由，但你还是会选择它，因为它是写作。写作后的喜悦冲散了发表的焦虑不安。3
如果写作仅仅是因为必要，那这个理由未免有点牵强，尤其对大多数普通的你我而言。在成为自由撰稿人之后，我深刻的体会到规律写作之必要。但不客气的说，写作是一…]]></summary>

When writing about open source software, I prefer to show a few screenshots to help demonstrate what I'm talking about. As the old saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. If you can show a thing, that's often better than merely trying to describe it.
There are a few ways you can take screenshots in Linux. Here are three methods I use to capture screenshots on Linux:
1. GNOME
GNOME has a great built-in screenshot tool. Just hit the PrtScr key on your keyboard, and GNOME displays a screenshot dialog:

Sustainability is an increasingly important problem when it comes to computing. Reduce, reuse, recycle is a popular motto for environmentally responsible consumption, but applying that to your computer hardware can be challenging.
Many proprietary operating systems essentially force a hardware upgrade upon you long before your old hardware is used up. If you own a computer with Windows, you've probably needed to purchase a new one to upgrade because your old one didn't meet the hardware requirements of the latest OS. Apple doesn't do any better, either. A MacBook Air I owned was essentially rendered obsolete by an upgrade to macOS Mojave in 2019.
By contrast, I ru…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文参与数字文具盒征文活动。

我是一名大二在读的本科生，经过大学一年的摸索，自认为对知识管理方面有一定的心得，想和各位分享一下。首先讲一下我的使用知识管理软件的理念：

不盲目追求all in one，专业的事要交给专业软件去做。
好的软件应该有助于思维方式的培养，而不是束缚自己的思考。

我将这个系统分为输入-暂存-整理-输出四部分，涵盖了知识的获取到内化的全流程，每个流程我基本都使用了不同的工具，思维导图如下。

 
一、知识输入
在信息爆炸的互联网时代，我们最不缺的就是信息，如何寻找到有用的信息便成为了关键，下面先罗列几个我平常获取知识的方式
实体书籍
我曾在网课期间有一段时间强迫自己进行完全电子化的学习，但我始终无法适应，来来回回看各种教程，折腾各类笔记软件也费时费力，于是我还是买来了纸质的课本和笔记本。对于我来说，实体书籍在我的学习中仍然占有很大一部分，简单快捷的体验可以让我更加专注于书中的内容。看到想要摘录的内容时我会手打到Flomo中，进行一个初步的提炼，也可以加深印象。虽然是分享数字文具盒，但我还是要提醒大家，不要盲目迷恋数字技术，有时回归实体也不失为一个好方法。
论文期刊网站
刚步入大学时我还没有查论文期刊的习惯，有啥新碰到的专业术语还是第一时间去查百度，得到的结果往往不知所云，有时还有很多纰漏。作为在校大学生，一般都是可以免费访问学校购买过的知网、维普、百度学术等网站的论文资源的，国外的论文也可以查谷歌学术和Sci-Hub，这些都比百度搜索出来的结果靠谱的多。
关于学术搜索有一个技巧，就是多使用「高级搜索」功能，可以找到更加准确的结果。有时你想搜索的一个定理可能不包含在论文标题中，这时在高级搜索中使用关键词搜索就会更容易检索到。以知网为例：

我想要搜索热传导当中一个叫「傅里叶定律」的东西，但直接在主题中搜索，结果太少，于是我在高级搜索中在左边选择关键…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[经济独立后，我很快发现自己之前的消费方式需要调整。
我之前买东西几乎没有计划，大部分是偶发性的，也有很多冲动购买。其次，我对价格有些不敏感，总觉得平台上是这个价格那就这样吧；对很多产品的质量也没有概念，常常不知道该从何判断。比如买水果，我都是让商家随机装一些就过秤拿走。我也很少考虑买东西之后的处置行为，比如多久该把东西淘汰，日用品一般要屯多久等等。
我逐渐觉得，我应该花些心思调整自己的生活和消费——我需要一个能让我在「重复购买」「快速更迭」的商品上省钱，可以为生活长远算计的在线平台。1688 就这样进入了我的视野。
1688 建立的初衷是为批发商或者商户找到合适的生产商，由于平台允许商户购买样品，所以个人消费者也可以在 1688 上进行购买。在 1688 平台进行了大半年采买后，我想和大家分享一下我的购物体验和购物感受，也欢迎各位朋友分享你的「批发」心得。
本文分享的所有产品和卖家均是来自于自己及朋友购买经历，不含有任何广告或者宣传。
在 1688 购物的原因
在 1688 购物主要就是为了两方面：规划预算省钱，适量囤货日用。1688 正好在这两点都是强项。
各大社交平台都有博主提过，同款的产品，其他购物平台基本价格一致，而 1688 上可以便宜一半甚至是更多。因为 1688 上的卖方是生产商，少了很多分销渠道的成本和加价。这也是为什么 1688 会有很多东西便宜到让人惊讶的原因，毕竟「要批发，上 1688」。
举个例子，我在南方经常要用的除湿袋，在 1688 上的价格是 0.7 元一包，购买超过 250 包，会便宜到 0.68 元。而在当地超市买到的同款至少一包 2 元，有些网购平台甚至要 5 元一包。
这是我楼下超市卖的同款，非常好用，五块钱一包。
偶尔一包可能价格差距不大，但这种除湿袋我每年都会用掉很多，累计起来就不在少数了，带上全寝室批发则开销更大。类似的还有袜子、…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marketing Examples by SwipeWell

We've curated 6,000+ handpicked marketing examples to add to your swipe file, available completely for free.

If you need some inspiration or are looking for a specific example... we’ve probably got something for you!

I spent over 100 hours putting together this massive database to make your job easier the next time you’re shipping a new landing page, email, or ad.

Fun fact: We actually used our own product (SwipeWell) to build this by swiping from the Chrome extension and organizing everything into Collections. So we’re our own biggest power user!

You’ll find everything from vintage ads to SaaS pricing pages to Black Friday emails in over 200 collections.

We’re firm believers that your swipe file is one of your most valuable creative assets. Use it for inspiration, to tease out best practices, and get you unstuck when you need some help creatively.

We’ll be adding more marketing examples as time goes on so make sure to bookmark it and check for new categories.

You can even submit an example you feel is worthy to be featured!

Let us know what you think and don’t forget to use SwipeWell to build your swipe file! 😉

最近换工作了，比较忙，没时间写博客了。但总不写也不好，所以后面我准备偷懒下，尽可能通过多贴些代码，控制时间了，就不在细节处多费话了。
正文
实现的效果是这样的：
刚开始的时候，是在dev上找了两个轮子，简单测了下，都不太满意，滑动事件处理的比较粗糙，总有bug。
就在想着，要不要拿源码改一版的时候，让我无意间看到了这个帖子

里面的想法，大开眼界，是通过 DraggableScrollableSheet 和 IgnorePointer 来完美实现上面的效果。
实现
这是 DraggableScrollableSheet 的代码，
DraggableScrollableSheet(
  maxChildSize: 0.8,
  minChildSize: 0.25, // 注意都是占父组件的比例
  initialChildSize: 0.25,
  expand: true,
  builder: (BuildContext context, ScrollController controller) {
    return Stack(); // body列表和header栏都在stack内
  },
)

这是 body 列表和 header，这里的 body 是个 list，
Stack(
  children: [
    Container(
      color: Colors.blue,
      child: Body(
        controller: controller,
        paddingTop: headerHeight, // 防止压盖
      ),
    ),
    const IgnorePointer( // 这里不接收事件，所以拖动 header 也能够滑动页面
      child: Header(
        height: headerHeight,
      ),
    ),
  ],
)

但如果我们想在 header 内加点击事件呢？那在 Stack header 上层再加 widget 就好了。
这是 body 的具体代码：
class Body extends StatelessWidget {
  final ScrollController controller;
  final double paddingTop;

  const Body({
    Key? key,
    required this.controller,
    required this.paddingTop,
  }) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    const divider = Divider(color: Colors.white, height: 0.5);
    const physics = ClampingScrollPhysics();
    return ListView.separated(
      padding: EdgeInsets.only(top: paddingTop), // 给定一个高度，防止压盖
      itemCount: 30,
      controller: controller,
      physics: physics, // 去掉默认回弹，优化iOS效果
      itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
        return ListTile(
          title: Center(
            child: Text('item:$index'),
          ),
          onTap: () {
            debugPrint('click item $index');
          },
        );
      },
      separatorBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
        return divider;
      },
    );
  }
}

代码我都放在 gitHub 上了，感兴趣的可以看下。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[制造固态硬盘产生的碳排放远超硬盘

固态硬盘的耗电量远低于硬盘，但一项新的研究意外地显示，它们的终生碳足迹要比硬盘高得多。研究人员测量了固态硬盘和硬盘在整个生命周期中每 GB 的碳足迹，他们发现，虽然固态硬盘在使用过程中的碳排放低于硬盘，但在制造过程中的碳密度要远高于硬盘。每制造一个 1TB 的固态硬盘会排放相当于 320 公斤的二氧化碳。相比之下，同等容量的硬盘只排放 40 公斤。而综合使用过程的碳排放，1 TB 的固态硬盘的终生碳足迹是 369.2 公斤二氧化碳，而硬盘是 199 公斤。另外，一台台式电脑的碳足迹几乎有 40% 来自固态硬盘，而 CPU 只占 4%，GPU 占 11%。

老王点评：固态硬盘就和新能源车一样，有些水面下的成本是你看不到的。




树莓派 4 增加对 3D API 的支持

树莓派基金会宣布，树莓派 4 符合 Vulkan 1.2 标准。树莓派的现在的桌面图形是由 OpenGL 驱动的，Vulkan 要取代的是旧的图形 API。该 API 可以为开发者提供与 2019 年英伟达显卡、2020 年英特尔集成显卡芯片和其他几十种设备相同的 3D 图形能力。对于大多数将树莓派用作服务器、DIY 控制器或轻型桌面的人来说，对 Vulkan 1.2 的支持并不重要。但是对游戏和 3D 应用来说应该会受益。


消息来源：ARS Technica



老王点评：虽然我想不出用树莓派玩 3D 游戏是什么体验，但是或许有比玩游戏更有趣的场景。




Winamp 5.9 释出首个 RC 版本

去年底，我们曾经报道过 Winamp 准备重启。现在，这个曾经最流行的音乐播放器 Winamp 释出了 Winamp 5.9 RC1。开发者称，对终端用户来说，Winamp 5.9 RC1 可能变化不大，但底层代码库进行了重大重构。在基础工作完成之后，他们将可以开始给软件修复和增添功能。


消息来源：Winamp



老王点评：虽然可能有些过时了，但是曾经的 Winamp 还是有很多人怀念。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME 正计划通知用户其固件安全状态，来保护不安全的硬件。




当你在支持 UEFI 的电脑上安装 Linux 时，你必须禁用“安全启动Secure Boot”，因为启用该选项后，不能使用现场 USBLive USB 启动。

一些主流的 Linux 发行版支持安全启动，但对于许多其他发行版（以及板载的 Nvidia 硬件）来说，它的设置仍然具有挑战性。

虽然一年又一年，情况似乎并没有改善，但总的来说，安全启动是一个必不可少的保护功能。

因此，正如 Phoronix 所发现的，为了方便和让用户意识到这一点，GNOME 和红帽的开发者正在努力在安全启动被禁用时通知（或警告）用户。

它有什么用？

UEFI/安全启动被批评为 DRM，因为它剥夺了用户的自由。开源社区的许多人仍然不赞同实施 UEFI/安全启动和 TPM，因为它带来了不便。这就催生了像 Coreboot 这样的项目在开源世界中蓬勃发展。

当然，如果你每天都用 Linux，我会建议你购买支持 Coreboot 的新硬件，这是一个不同的故事。

话虽如此，但可以肯定的是，安全启动是最简单的方法。

考虑到捆绑的专有固件，安全启动的安全性仍然值得商榷。但是，它是一个确保系统的固件安全的基本保护机制。

所以，开发者准备在启动闪屏（Plymouth）、GNOME 显示管理器（GDM）和 GNOME 控制中心显示警告。



GNOME 的一位开发者在 博客文章 中分享了它的更多细节，同时给出了其中的一些屏幕截图。



一位来自红帽的开发者在 合并请求 中提到。


安全启动被用来对付一些恶意软件试图感染系统的固件的安全威胁。用户可能会无意中禁用或软件可能会有意禁用安全启动。因此，配置不正确的话，系统就运行在一个不安全的平台上。如果启动闪屏能向用户提供一个警告，用户可以重新启动并重新配置他们的系统，或者立即寻求帮助。


所以，作为一个 GNOME 用户，当它进入 GNOME 43 的最终版本或任何未来的版本时，我乐于看到它所带来的变化。

如果你也想看看，你可以在 GNOME 控制中心的“隐私Privacy”标签下的“设备安全Device Security”部分找到这个选项，如下图所示，我的机器在 Arch Linux 上运行 GNOME 43 alpha。



该菜单还可以显示 TPM、英特尔 BootGuard 和 IOMMU 保护的细节。



看来我的系统并不像我想象的那么安全……但也许这就是这个功能的意义所在？

如果你只在你的 Linux 发行版上使用 UEFI 模式，并且为了方便而关闭了安全保护功能，这能让你意识到这一点吗？

有可能。但是，看看 Linux 发行版的状况和启用安全启动的问题。我不觉得这可能会是一个大问题。我们很快就会知道了。

如何禁用这个警告？

正如在 GNOME Gitlab 的 合并请求 中提到的，在你的内核参数中添加 sb-check=false 就可以禁用这些警告。

不过，作为终端用户，你不需要担心这个问题。

你对即将在 GNOME 43 或更高版本中增加的这个功能有什么看法？你对 UEFI/安全启动有什么看法？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我喜欢使用本地 SMTP 守护进程从我的笔记本电脑发送电子邮件，因为这样我即使在断开连接的情况下也可以发送电子邮件，而且，即使是在网络正常的情况下，因为我不需要等待网络协议在远程 smarthost 上完成。哦，我还需要本地邮件投递。

多年来，我一直使用 Postfix 来达到这些目的。它具有可接受的简单配置。但最近我开始喜欢 VPN（mullvad，如果你想知道的话），而在 /etc/resolv.conf 发生变化时会变得混乱（例如，你在 Postfix 的服务启动后才启动 VPN）。我找到了一个非常简单的替代方案：OpenSMTPD。

假设我想在使用 jao@gnu.org 发送电子邮件时使用 SMTP 服务器 fencepost.gnu.org，而在我的 From 头中使用 mail@jao.io 或 news@xmobar.org 时使用 smtp.jao.io。OpenSMTPD 让你通过一个非常简单的配置文件 /etc/smtpd.conf 来实现：

（这是我的 Debian 机器中的默认配置文件。另一个流行的替代方案是 /etc/openstmpd.conf）。

table aliases file:/etc/aliases
table secrets db:/etc/mail/secrets.db

table sendergnu { jao@gnu.org }
table senderjao { mail@jao.io, news@xmobar.org }

listen on localhost

action "local" mbox alias <aliases>
action "relaygnu" relay host smtp+tls://gnu@fencepost.gnu.org:587 auth <secrets>
action "relayjao" relay host smtps://jao@smtp.jao.io:465 auth <secrets>

match for local action "local"
match for any from mail-from <sendergnu> action "relaygnu"
match for any from mail-from <senderjao> action "relaygan"


我们还为此配置了本地投递。这是完整的配置文件！唯一需要的另一件事是生成 secrets.db 文件，其中包含与键 gnu 和 jao 对应的用户和密码（这些只是任意名称）。为此，我们使用它们创建一个纯文本文件，使用形式为 <key> <user>:<password> 的条目：

gnu  jao:my fencepost password
jao  mail@jao.io:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


fencepost.gnu.org 用户是 jao，smtp.jao.io 的用户是 mail@jao.io（你看，不需要转义空格或 ats）。然后我们使用程序 makemap 来创建密钥数据库：

makemap secrets && rm secrets

In the first article of this series, Get started with NetworkManager on Linux, I looked at what NetworkManager does and some of the tools it provides for viewing network connections and devices. I discussed using the nmcli command to view the status of network devices and connections on a host. I also mentioned that NetworkManager does not need interface configuration files for most hosts. However, it can create its own INI-style connection configuration files, and it recognizes the older and now deprecated network interface configuration files.
This article explores three questions:
Why do I not use interface configuration files?
Why do I use interfa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[深度发布独立软件包格式：玲珑

深度操作系统预计在本月发布新的 Deepin 23 操作系统，其中将采用一种新的独立软件包格式：玲珑。 深度社区称玲珑是“统信软件自研的开源软件包格式，用于与 dpkg、rpm 等包管理系统共同实现应用包管理、分发、沙箱、集成开发工具等功能。”根据披露的特性，玲珑软件包可运行在任意 Linux 桌面环境中，运行在独立的沙箱环境，支持应用增量更新。


消息来源：深度



老王点评：看来是一种容器式软件包。确实，要打造一个“根操作系统”，是应该有个独立的软件包体系才名正言顺，但是应该有真正的软件包方面的创新才有意义。据我所知，这是国内这批“根操作系统”中第一个提出自己的软件包格式的操作系统。让我们拭目以待这个玲珑之后的进一步信息。




英特尔将在 2024 年推出 Wi-Fi 7

因为苹果正在将其设备过渡到 Wi-Fi 6E，英特尔正计划在 2024 年之前在设备中安装其下一代 Wi-Fi 7（802.11be）技术。Wi-Fi 7 是 Wi-Fi 6E（802.11ax）的继任者，带来了两倍于 5.8Gbps 的数据处理速度和更稳定的 6GHz 带宽稳定性，在处理数据时支持高达 36Gbps 带宽。苹果还没有发布任何支持 Wi-Fi 6E 的设备，有望在今年从 iPhone 14 开始支持。


消息来源：MacRumors



老王点评：前两天刚刚换了一个 Wi-Fi 路由器，支持 Wi-Fi 6，我才用上，而这都要 Wi-Fi 7 了。不知不觉中无线网络技术居然已经进步这么快了。




教科书出版商希望借助区块链来在电子书转售时挣钱

世界上最大的教科书出版商之一培生公司的 CEO 说，他希望像 NFT 和区块链这样的技术可以帮助该公司从电子书的二手销售中分得一杯羹，因为越来越多的书籍以电子书形式销售。纸质书籍，尤其是昂贵的教科书，有时候会转售七次之多，但转售不会出版商带来任何收益。而随着教科书转向数字化，教科书出版商看到了从转售中获利的可能。


消息来源：彭博社



老王点评：纸质书转售对出版商没好处是因为出版商第一次就收到了足够的钱。而电子书却给出版商带来机会，让出版商有望控制电子书的二次流通，并通过它再次获利。]]></summary>

一般情况下，服务端接口都会有一套数据结构规范，比如
{
    "items": [],
    "success": true,
    "msg": ""
}

不同的接口，items 中返回的数据结构一般都是不一样的，这时使用泛型，可以简化代码
本文将以 wanAndroid 提供的开放 API 为例，介绍如何通过泛型类接解析 JSON 数据，简化代码。另外，对 wanAndroid 提供开放 API 的行为表示感谢。
本文解析 JSON 使用的方案，是官方推荐的 json_serializable，至于为什么选择 json_serializable，可以参考我之前写的一篇文章：Flutter 使用 json_serializable 解析 JSON 最佳方案
下面开始进入正文
使用 json_serializable 支持泛型
json_serializable 在大概两年前发布的  v3.5.0 版本开始支持泛型，只需要在 @JsonSerializable() 注解中设置 genericArgumentFactories 为 true，同时需要对 fromJson  和 toJson  方法进行调整，即可支持泛型解析，如下所示：
@JsonSerializable(genericArgumentFactories: true)
class Response<T> {
  int status;
  T value;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[「记录」这件事就是非常有威力，它会把注意力之外的小细节收集起来，给予一种确实发生但又意料之外的生活视角。比如如果不是记账，我不知道原来每个月会支出那么多零零碎碎的「拿铁因子」；如果不是 HiWater，我也不会知道原来自己摄入那么多含糖饮料。
其实我很早之前就购买过 WaterMinder 这款 App Store Editors's Choice 应用，只是彼时的我并不明白「多喝水」三个字对身体的意义，同时也觉得记录喝水这件事就像是记账——没有外部约束、「记录多少全凭诚实美德」的记录只在于自我娱乐。所以往往三天后意兴阑珊删除了事。
HiWater 则是好友 @特伦 推荐的，把玩了下觉得还不错，但当时并不想为这个需求掏钱；不久前确诊痛风后，离开诊室满心灰暗的我有了「每天喝水 3L+」的刚需，这才发现这款应用的每一个付费点都值得我掏钱。
作为一款国产应用，HiWater 的饮品目录预设种类都比较契合日常，并且在目录处还醒目地标注了每 100 毫升所带有的千卡热量。向下翻阅到高热量饮品时甚至有一种黑名单的既视感。

如此设计的部分原因是，HiWater 采用了「饮水金字塔」模型，它将所有饮品归在六个等级内，并依此建议每日摄入的比例。此模型虽有哈佛大学公共卫生学院专家的背书，总体指导思想依然是鼓励大家多喝白水，减少摄入高糖、甚至是含糖饮料。
关联阅读：如何合理控制糖分摄入

对喝水提醒应用来说，我们一般会面临预设饮品难以覆盖真实世界情况的问题。
所以在 HiWater 中我们也可以新增或编辑饮品类目到「饮水金字塔」模型中，把某个模糊的品类变成精确的单品。比如说 HiWater 预设了椰子水这个饮品，但我日常喝得比较多的是山姆椰子水，那我就直接编辑成山姆椰子水的营养成分，并重新归类到低卡饮料分类中去；再比如我喝的柠檬水是浓缩液和水 1:10 冲兑而来，因此我也通过计算将预设的「柠檬水」编辑成「自制柠檬水」，并由浓缩液计算出对应的热量。
当然，手动编辑多了我们自然就会想：这些外包装上带有营养成分表的商品饮料，如何快捷记录到应用内？
HiWater 的答案是「直接用相机扫」，请直接看这个动图：

我猜测可能 Apple 在系统中给了 OCR 相关的 API，开发者就取来做这个功能了。这是我最喜欢的功能，实际使用起来识别比动图中要更迅速，识别率高且稳定。偶尔可能会有一些识别错误，比如把 ≥ 识别成 2，但我也能原谅。
如此一来，在机场购买的农夫山泉力量帝柠檬水、屯了两箱的兰芳园低糖冻柠茶，都可以统统扫入我的饮品目录。记录时也可以根据自己的实际情况调整，比如冻柠茶虽是低糖，我还是会将它兑冰水或柠檬水喝，因此我的喝水记录里经常会出现 50 毫升的冻柠茶、紧接着出现 200 毫升的水或柠檬水。

之前做手冲咖啡用的秤，现在大多被我用于称水喝，但后续我发现只要记住水倒在杯子上的花纹位置，不用秤也能大致知道这杯水的量。以名创优品的 580 毫升容积的可乐杯为例，杯内两道凹痕，分别可以粗略看作是 200/500 毫升的刻度。在公司喝水，可以考虑在工位启用大杯子装水，之前因为杯子小+次数少，上班时喝水太少。一周下来，确实每日喝水 3.3L 以上。

其余的基础功能，诸如弹出提醒用户喝水、身体水分的简单预估、根据用户情况估算需要摄入的水量等，我就不一一展开了，WaterMinder 也有，我认为这些是一款「喝水类」App 都应该做的免费功能。其实我原先也是想通过快捷指令自己做一个提醒和记录每日喝水的应用，这不难，我甚至已经做好了 社死版快捷指令 定时运行，但体验过 HiWater 的一些交互后，我最后决定不折腾自己了。
应用内还有不少花心思的交互和设计
HiWater 多样的桌面小组件，还支出快捷录入饮品，打破了我对 iOS 小组件「能看不能用」的固有认知（我原先在 iOS 上并不使用任何 Widget，这一下就微上瘾了，顺带一口气添加了其余应用的小组件 xD）。
精美的 Widget，支持快捷录入
HiWater 采用免费下载+内购解锁的付费机制，如果你看完文章对它感兴趣，安装来把玩把玩也可以。如果想要为它付费的话，建议先确认自己有强烈的督促自己喝水的需求，然后订阅一个月试试——我直接买断是因为意识到「多喝水」这样的生活我可能要持续好几个月，甚至好几年，本身并不是很理性的消费习惯。
如果一个应用能够帮助我长期维持某个健康习惯，我愿意给出「十刀买断，天大划算」的评价；如果没有，我也会用「三分钟热度三分钟收获」来安慰自己。

When I use the Linux command line, whether I'm writing a new program on my desktop computer or managing a website on my web server, I often need to process text files. Linux provides powerful tools that I leverage to get my work done. I frequently use sed, an editor that can modify text according to a pattern.
sed stands for stream editor, and it edits text in a file and prints the results. One way to use sed is to identify several occurrences of one string in a file and replace them with a different string. You can use sed to process text files to a seemingly endless degree, but I'd like to share a few ways I use sed to help me manage files.

如果你认真看，读800字就可以学会这个App。

一、我讲
今天，我先讲Android MVC模型的界面操作，再说TextView、Button两个控件的使用。
1.1 MVC
Android开发给Java开发讲MVC模型，多此一举了。
graph TD
M[Model模型] --> V[View视图]
C[Controller 控制器] --> V
C --> M

优弧说不要讲烂大街的东西。我此处稍微一提MVC在Android中是如何界定的。
看这个皮影戏，艺人按照剧本操作皮影人物在幕布上表演，这就是典型的MVC。

在安卓项目里，Activity就是艺人(控制器Controller)。layout下的xxx.xml就是皮影幕布(视图View)。

今天就说这俩, 模型Model用不到，所以不说。
1.2 控件：文本和按钮
Android中，展示文本的控件叫TextView，按钮叫Button。
视图的代码在layout文件夹中，控件的定义采用的是xml格式。
比如，文本控件TextView在xml中这么定义：
<TextView 
    android:id="@+id/tv"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="Hello World!"/>

它有很多属性：

其实，按钮Button也是一样：
<Button 
    android:id="@+id/btn"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_he…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[为什么需要通信
由于不同的进程运行在各自不同的内存空间中．一方对于变量的修改另一方是无法感知的．因此．进程之间的信息传递不可能通过变量或其它数据结构直接进行，只能通过进程间通信来完成。
并发进程之间的相互通信是实现多进程间协作和同步的常用工具．具有很强的实用性，进程通信是操作系统内核层极为重要的部分。
几种常见的进程间通信

管道
管道，一听名字，我们联想到一个管子连通的两端，既然是个管子，就可以从一头输入，从另一头输出，形成一次通信，在shell命令行中，我们经常遇到这样的写法：
adb logcat -v time | grep "tag" > log.txt

熟悉么？‘|’ 符号其实就类似一个管道一样，将前一个命令的输出，通过管道输入到后一命令的输入，完成一次通信，作为一个标准的程序员，探究问题，要看其本质，这样才能将知识融会贯通，UNIX的设计原则是一切皆文件，那我们猜测，管道的本质也是一个文件，前面的进程以写方式打开文件，后面的进程以读方式打开。这样前面写完后面读，于是就实现了通信。而在Linux中，管道被文件系统所管理，文件系统是操作系统中负责管理持久数据的子系统，是在磁盘之上的，为什么你的电脑可以动态扩充磁盘，其实主要归功于文件系统，通过它，我们可以无限扩充，文件系统的好处是即使计算机断电了，磁盘里的数据并不会丢失，可以持久化的保存文件。
再说回管道，管道一种分为两种
匿名管道
命名管道
匿名管道 Pipes
所谓匿名就是没名，用完就没了，上面的‘|’，就是一个匿名管道。它的特点是只能在父子进程中应用，父进程在产生子进程前必须打开一个管道文件，然后fork产生子进程，这样子进程通过拷贝父进程的进程地址空间获得同一个管道文件的描述符，以达到使用同一个管道通信的目的。
命名管道 FIFO
通过 mkfifo 命令显式地创建。
mkfifo hello

携手创作，共同成长！这是我参与「掘金日新计划 · 8 月更文挑战」的第1天，点击查看活动详情
一、我讲
我会讲一下Android开发工具的下载和安装，以及Android项目的文件结构。
1.1 Android Studio开发工具
工具介绍
Android程序的开发主要用到两个工具：Android SDK和Android Studio。
Android SDK就相当于Java的JDK，里面有Android系统的各种软件支持和资源，相当于一个原料和工具仓库。
Android Studio就相当于Java的IDEA,是开发Android软件的软件，提供代码编写和程序编译，相当于生产车间，会从SDK仓库里取物资。
下载和安装
下载地址 Android Studio，下载完成后，正常安装。
Android Studio里面会自带一版最新的Android SDK，因此不用额外下载和配置，开箱即用。
安装完成之后，打开软件，进入到如下加载界面：

加载之后，显示如下界面（最新版本会有差异）：

至此，安装完成。
1.2 Android项目文件结构
Android项目的主目录结构如下：

Android项目的代码目录结构如下：

二、你做
学完上面的知识，你可以尝试建立一个HelloWorld程序。
2.1 新建第一个Android程序并运行
新建项目
从欢迎页面，选择【Start a new Android Studio project】(新建Android项目)，注意项目名称和包名（类似Java中的groupId+artifactId），其他一路默认即可。

新建模拟器
Android项目建立完成之后，需要在手机上运行，Android SDK提供了一个手机模拟器，用于调试程序。
在项目页面，点击顶部菜单栏的手机图标，可以新建手机模拟器，模拟器只需要建立一次。
会依次经历选择屏幕尺寸、安卓版本、给模拟器起名，不关键，选择默认就好。

模拟器建立完成之后，点击顶部菜单的Run图标。选择模拟器，刚刚建好了一个，就选它，点击OK。

HelloWorld跑起来了。

三、总结
现在，行业内多是Android转Java，很少有Java转Android的。
但是，这并不妨碍Java同学了解Android开发，从学习的角度去拓宽自己的知识面。
恰好，我两者都会。所以，我会以最精简的语言来编写一个系列教程（第一季估计30篇，日更）。
其实，不管是Java还是python，只要有编程基础的同学，一天看800字，30天可入门安卓。
因我的电脑较老，选用的Android Studio不是最新版，这对于有编程基础的同学，影响不大。]]></summary>

当口罩遮掩了情绪，当流调成了国人日常最真实的画像，当内心的平静取决于居家食物的储存量，远方让渡给了附近，未来模糊为了当下，我们如何在原子化的生存状态里，重新建立起与他人的连接？
是起于对一轮热播剧集的热议，是源自对一段电影台词的共鸣，或是深受到一个虚构故事的温暖，我们经由共同的关注、共通的情感，摆脱对彼此的割裂，重新找回旧时的默契。
所以，我相信，好的「作品」能够化为一种广泛的媒介，跨越时间之差、地域之隔，在不确定的世界里，引导我们重新拥抱当代生活。行至年中，回看年终，以下是我的 2021 年度作品推荐。
📖 最佳书籍
也许你该找个人聊聊

作者：洛莉·戈特利布
出版社：果麦文化 / 上海文化出版社
出版年：2021-7
页数：460
推荐指数：⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

没有空泛无物的理论说教，也不同于自我中心的人物传记，这是一位心理治疗师的回忆录，讲述的是发生在诊室中的动人故事。在书中，我们会看到四个来访者，他们性格秉性不同，背景身份迥异，却因遭受各自人生困境，都来寻求心理治疗。同时，书中还有第五个寻求帮助的人，那就是心理治疗师自己。她是一个单身的职场妈妈，四十多岁时遭遇失恋，几乎崩溃。有朋友对她说，「或许你该找个人聊聊」，于是，她也给自己找了一位心理治疗师，切换到了来访者的位置，给自己的内心举起一面映照的镜子。
作者洛莉·戈特利布大学毕业后，在全美广播公司从事剧集创作工作，一次为收集素材、跟随急诊医生到郡立医院的探访，令她颇受震撼——「亲身经历的事情，使杜撰出来的故事显得那样单薄」。洛莉自此萌生攻读斯坦福医学…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🌟 Part 1 不想错过精彩内容

2022 年 2 月 7 日，我由于一些契机接触到了少数派。1 个月里，我阅读了很多大家写的文章，当时的感觉就是：哇，少数派的作者写的东西太真诚了，每一篇文章的背后都是一段实实在在的亲身实践。对于我而言，虽然自己也会记笔记，但是它们总是零零散散，后面回顾的效果也不是特别好。最后干脆也不经常整理和看笔记了。
然而我又不想错过少数派写的诸如《Power +》等文章的精华，因此甚是苦恼。假如有一个机器，能够帮助我轻松地记录「小灵感 / 知识碎片 / 心得体会」，并且还能够帮助我更好地进行回顾就好了。当然，也不是说就要一字不落的把全文都背下来，没必要。所以我希望它可以让我在打开手机的时候，能够把我之前学习的知识链条清晰地展示出来。

注：文中的链接会在文末一并再次放出，开启深色模式可以获得最佳阅读体验

🌟 Part 2 与 Flomo 相识

在想法诞生的第二天，我就在少数派探索到了 Flomo。在这之前，我几乎从来没有系统化地整理过知识（高考笔记除外），也没有做过任何对外的内容输出。
当时就想，这白白绿绿的 App 看着还挺轻盈，有一种树林小草在生长的感觉。打开后瞬间被它极简的界面吸引住了 —— 每当你需要写一张小卡片的时候，你只需要像发微博一样，点击下方的加号即可撰写内容。
简单尝试之后，发现 App 的配色、间距都非常的统一，每一条内容就是一张精美的小卡片。用 Flomo 写作有一种极强的沉浸感。于是我开始用它来记录自己每一个时刻迸发的想法，以及摘录和批注在少数派读到的受启发的内容（如图）；接着对它进行批注，来记录思考后的链接卡片。整个使用过程中没有任何规则和冗长的教学来约束我「应该如何去用一款笔记 App」，仿佛在写朋友圈，简单而便捷。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[很多人都有显性或隐性的心理问题，需要依托一些手段改善或治疗。常见的心理治疗为行为治疗、认知治疗、人本主义疗法、团体治疗等等。不过，从二十世纪六十年代至今以来，综合疗法（Eclectic/Integrative therapy) ，即采用结合各种方向的各种方法进行治疗，仍然是广受欢迎的治疗手段，其中最为有效的是认知-行为疗法（CBT）。
本文中，我们要来谈一种相对特殊的治疗方案——家庭治疗。家庭治疗虽然在国内外应用的都不多，但是背后的一些方法，也许能够帮助到我们目前疫情之下的紧张的家庭关系。比如文中介绍的叙事疗法、绘制家系图、专注解决方法等都是一些平时可以自己或者和家人一起试着练习的方法。
什么是家庭治疗
家庭治疗兴起于二十世纪中期，属于团体治疗（group therpay）的一部分。他们一致反对主流的声音，即认为心理症状只来自于个体本身，提出心理问题其实是来自个体与他人相处方式受到干扰所带来的副产品。
家庭治疗认为，心理症状是个体所处的家庭由于功能失调所带来的副产品。
家庭治疗师从哲学和科学当中借鉴了一个理论：系统方法（system approach），即整体大于部分之和。换句话说，其实是从个人治疗的思想中切换到以家庭为单位（faimly-unit）治疗思想。治疗师关注的是整个家庭状况，而不是单独针对个人，将责任归咎于家庭中的某个人，或者指责某个人。所以，家庭治疗中，最基本的东西。过程中，家庭成员与治疗师一起努力，改善成员之间的互动，从而加强每个成员的心理健康。
系统理论
系统方法的核心是循环因果关系（Circular causality）比线性因果关系（Linear causality）更能解释心理问题。

线性因果关系（Linear Casuality）：A 影响 B；但 B 不影响 A。意思是，父母对待孩子的方式影响孩子的后续行为，但孩子的后续行为并不会反过来影响父母…]]></summary>

IPv6 is a good thing for the Internet in general, but I find it unnecessarily complex for use in most home and small- to medium-size businesses. Like many others, I continue to use private IPv4 address ranges for my own internal networks and those for which I have some level of responsibility. My ISP only provides IPv4 addresses anyway, so it makes no sense to use IPv6 internally when all external packets are IPv4. Besides, IPv4 is much simpler, and one of my Linux Philosophy tenets is "Find the Simplicity."
As a result, I disabled IPv6 on all my hosts. It seemed easy—at first. Here is how I did it.

Everyone does program management. Some just do it poorly.
I've used that line for a laugh at the beginning of talks, but it's true. Program management is, at its core, the act of coordinating the interfaces between teams to produce something of value. In open source projects, the "something of value" is generally the software that the community produces. Most open source communities create software, and almost none of them have a formal program manager. So why have a program manager?
The difference lies in managing the software development with intent instead of by accident. The smaller the community, the easier it is to self-coordinate. The need for intentional co…]]></summary>

2022 年 3 月辞职，没多久上海爆发疫情，蜗居在家准备面试。在经历 1 个月的闭关和 40+ 场 Android 面试后，拿到一些 offer。
总体上说，有如下几种面试题型：
基础知识
算法题
项目经历
场景题
场景题，即“就业务场景给出解决方案”，考察运用知识解决问题的能力。这类题取决于临场应变、长期积累、运气。
项目经历题取决于对工作内容的总结提炼、拔高升华、运气：
争取到什么样的资源
安排了怎么样的分工
搭建了什么样的架构
运用了什么模式
做了什么样的取舍
采用了什么策略
做了什么样的优化
解决了什么问题
力争把默默无闻的“拧螺丝”说成惊天动地的“造火箭”。（这是一门技术活）
但也不可避免地会发生“有些人觉得这是高大上的火箭，有些人觉得不过是矮小下的零件”。面试就好比相亲，甲之蜜糖乙之砒霜是常有的事。除非你优秀到解决了某个业界的难题。
算法题取决于刷题，运气，相较于前两类题，算法题可“突击”的成分就更多了。只要刷题足够多，胜算就足够大。大量刷，反复刷。
基础知识题是所有题型中最能“突击”的，它取决于对“考纲”的整理复习、归纳总结、背诵、运气。Android 的知识体系是庞杂的，对于有限的个人精力来说，考纲是无穷大的。
这不是一篇面经，把面试题公布是不讲武德的。但可以分享整个复习稿，它是我按照自己划定的考纲整理出的全部答案，由于篇幅太长，决定把全部内容分成两篇分享给大家，这一篇的内容是 Android 和 Java & Kotlin。（必有遗漏，欢迎补充~）
整个复习稿分为如下几大部分：
Android
Java & Kotlin
设计模式 & 架构
多线程

OkHttp & Retrofit
Glide

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
使用组件化多模块开发的同学都有经验，当我们修改底层模块(比如util模块)时，所有依赖于这个模块的上层模块都需要重新编译，Kotlin的增量编译在这种情况往往是不生效的
在 Kotlin 1.7.0 中，Kotlin编译器对于跨模块增量编译也做了支持，并且与Gradle构建缓存兼容，对编译避免的支持也得到了改进。这些改进减少了模块和文件重新编译的次数，让整体编译更加迅速
优化效果
首先来看下Kotlin官方的数据， 以下基准测试结果在 Kotlin 项目中的 kotlin-gradle-plugin 模块上测得：

可以看出，当缓存命中时有86%到96%的加速效果，当缓存没有命中时也有26%的加速效果
我在项目中开启后实测效果也很不错，修改一个底层模块，在特性开启前需要耗时4分钟左右，开启后增量编译耗时减少到30到40s，加速约85%
如何开启
在 gradle.properties 文件中设置以下选项即可使用新方式进行增量编译：
kotlin.incremental.useClasspathSnapshot=true

对于增量编译，稳定性和可靠性至关重要。有时增量编译总会失效，Kotlin 1.7同样支持为编译任务创建编译报告，报告包含不同编译阶段的持续时间以及无法使用增量编译的原因，可以帮助你定位为什么增量编译失效了
关于编译报告的启用与使用可见：隆重推出 Kotlin 构建报告
原理解析
编译避免和增量编译
之前介绍了Kotlin 快速编译背后的黑科技，了解一下~，其实主要就是介绍了编译避免与增量编译
快速编译的一大核心是应用程序二进制接口 (ABI)。 如果两个类在用作编译类路径时可互换，则它们具有相同的 ABI。
这样说可能有点抽象，ABI通常是指类对外暴露的部分，比如函数声明。当我们修改函数体时，ABI是没有发生变化的，如果我们修改了函数声明，则ABI发…]]></summary>

我正在参加「创意开发 投稿大赛」详情请看：掘金创意开发大赛来了！
如果需要在 Android、 iOS、Web、Desktop 等平台快速实现如上图所示的动画效果，你第一考虑会怎么做？
也许你会说使用 Flutter ？不不不，如果还需要兼容多技术栈呢？例如支持 Flutter 、React、Vue、C++ 等不同语言和技术平台呢？
这时候也许你会想到 Lottie ，诚然 Lottie 的动画效果确实十分优秀，也支持 Android、 iOS、React Native、Web、 Windows 等平台，但是它的输入来源于 After Effects 动画特效，并且依赖于 Bodymovin 插件，这对于个人开发或者  UI 设计师来说，从 0 开始学习的门槛还是不低的。

而本篇将给你推荐另外一个更简单又强大的动画开发平台： rive  ，对于 rive 可能大家会感觉比较陌生，做过 Flutter 开发的可能对 rive 会有所耳闻，因为 rive 在此之前叫 flare ，是 2dimensions 公司的开源动画产品，在发布之初由于和 Flutter 团队有深入合作，所以在初期一直是 Flutter 官方推荐的动画框架。
后来由于 flare 项目被合并所以升级为 rive ，升级后的 rive 开始把动画效果拓展到全平台，这个全平台不只是物理设备的全平台，还包括了跨语言和框架的全平台，不过可惜和第一代 flare 存在断档不兼容。





本篇之所以推荐 rive 来实现多端动画，主要有以下几个原因：
支持手机端、Web 端 和PC 端等平台支持
支持 React 、Flutter、Unity 等多种框架，Vue 和 Angular 也有社区支持
支持 JS、Dart、C++ 等多种语言

前言
前一阵子帮业务同学解决了个代码问题，其实挺有意思的，就打算和大家分享下这个内容。
先简单的介绍下背景，业务同学写了个apt的框架，然后里面包含一个注解的库，而注解库中需要使用到Android源码中的View。但是因为这是一个Java Library，无法直接将安卓的源码添加到依赖中，就无法引用到View。然后他们为了解决这个问题，又创建了一个库，然后生成了一个同包名的Android View，类似下图这总，然后compileOnly这个库。

因为这个模块内有了这个View，业务同学在后续调试系统源码的时候都会进到这个造假出来的View上去了，就产生了很大的干扰作用。原因呢其实就是因为这个类呗添加到sourceSet中了，同名类的情况下会优先使用上层加载的。
这种在java库内需要造假出一些Android View,就变成了一个很好玩的东西了。接下来我们就通过gradle的一些简单的操作，来把这个坑填上。
详细代码可以看下这个  Router-Android
Gradle Java Compiler Task
在build.gradle中，我们可以声明一个task任务，然后声明这个任务继承的类型，让它变成一个可以java编译代码的任务。
task("stubLib", JavaCompile::class) {
    source(file("src/stub/java"))
    classpath = project.files(getAndroidJar("32"))
    // libraries
    destinationDirectory.set(File(project.buildDir, "/tmp/stubLibs"))
}

前言
现在的 App 基本都需要同意用户协议和隐私政策，通常会用富文本 Span 来实现局部点击。而 Span 的代码经常会写一大堆，如何封装简化代码个人思考了很久，最终基于官方的 core-ktx 库进行封装，实现一套完整好用的 Span API。
接下来和大家分享个人的封装思路和最终实现的效果。
基础用法
我们用一个同意隐私协议的需求作为例子，这里假设“隐私协议”不仅需要局部点击，还要加斜体，效果如下：

要实现这个效果也不难，稍微学习下 SpannableString 就能实现出来。
val spannableString = SpannableString("已同意隐私政策")
val urlSpan = URLSpan("https://xxxxxxxx.com") // 超链接
val italicSpan = StyleSpan(Typeface.ITALIC)  // 斜体
spannableString.setSpan(urlSpan, 3, 7, Spanned.SPAN_INCLUSIVE_EXCLUSIVE)
spannableString.setSpan(italicSpan, 3, 7, Spanned.SPAN_INCLUSIVE_EXCLUSIVE)
textView.movementMethod = LinkMovementMethod.getInstance() // 设置了才能点击
textView.text = spannableString

讲下其中的 flags 参数，有以下类型：

🔥 Hi，我是小彭。本文已收录到 GitHub · Android-NoteBook 中。这里有 Android 进阶成长知识体系，有志同道合的朋友，关注公众号 [彭旭锐] 带你建立核心竞争力。
前言
在日常开发过程中，Unicode & UTF-8 并不是很受关注的知识，但在阅读源码或文章时，出现频率很高。如果你没有理解清楚 Unicode、UTF-8、UTF-16 和 UTF-32 之前的关系，会带来阅读障碍。在这篇文章里，我将带你理解 Unicode 字符集的原理，希望能帮上忙。
1. 什么是字符编码
1.1 什么是字符？
字符（Character） 是对文字和符号的总称，例如汉字、拉丁字母、emoji 都是字符。在计算机中，一个字符由 2 部分组成：
1、字符的编码： 字符在计算机上的存储格式。例如在 ASCII 字符集中，字符 A 的编码就是 65；
2、用户看到的图画： 字符的编码经过软件渲染后，呈现给用户的图画。同一个编码，在不同的软件渲染后呈现的图画可以是不同的。披萨的 Unicode 编码是 U+1F355，而在不同的软件渲染的图片可能是不同的。

你经常会在很多词语上看到 “编码” 这个单词，对初学者来说很容易混淆。今天我列举出 “编码” 常见的 3 层解释，希望能帮助你以后在阅读文章时快速理解作者的意思。
含义 1 - 作为动词： 表示把一个字符转换为一个二进制机器数的过程，这个机器数才是字符在计算机中真实存储/传输的格式。例如把 A 转换为 65(ASCII) 的动作，就是一个编码动作；
含义 2 - 作为名词： 表示经过编码动作后得到的那个机器数，对于 A 来说，65(ASCII) 就是 A …]]></summary>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

前阵子收到了小宇宙的消息推送，我才发现不知不觉，我已经在小宇宙听了 200 小时播客了，最开始只是偶尔听听，后来越来越喜欢，几乎每天只有有空就都要打开小宇宙，把听播客这个习惯无缝融入到了我的日常 routine 中。
今天这一篇，我想复盘一下在我从播客萌新到播客重度听众的这 200 个小时中我的收获和体验，以及对播客这种内容形式的思考。
我喜欢听哪些播客？
我收听的播客领域主要集中在这几类：互联网、商业分析、心理学、轻松休闲类。

📻 互联网行业：《三五环》《温柔一刀》《组织进化论》等等
📻 商业分析：《无人知晓》《疯投圈》
📻 心理学：《得意忘形》
📻 轻松休闲类：《日谈公园》《谐星聊天会》

我一般都是在家用电脑做一些不需要太集中精力的工作的时候，会去听我喜欢的一些有信息量的播客，收听到有价值的信息的时候，会直接打开电脑上的记事本，或者用 flomo 记录下当时觉得有价值的信息和思考。
而一个人出门散步、吃饭的时候，会放日谈公园或者谐星聊天会这种信息浓度不高的播客，作为放松休闲的背景音。
我的小宇宙收听总结里收听时长最长的播客是张潇雨老师的《得意忘形》，刘飞老师的《三五环》以及孟岩老师的《无人知晓》。这三档播客也是我目前最喜欢的三档播客。

播客为什么吸引了我？
在听了 200 个小时的播客之后，我开始对播客这一内容形式有了一些思考，我开始想：
播客为什么吸引到了我，能让我愿意付出这么多时间去使用它？播客这一种内容形式，和其他的内容形式又有什么特别之处？
我尝试着从我自己作为普通用户的角度，也夹杂着我作为一个内容运营的…]]></summary>

6-7月的事情着实有点多。没有清风亦没有鲜花，连蝉都热到燥不动了，人自然也变得慵懒了许多。
月头计划和诸君探讨下Compose（Compose-Desktop）和MVI实际投产后的感受，眼看即将到月底，低头看着才写一半的草稿，沉默良久，大抵这个月是没有希望成稿了。
终究，只能挑一些最近遇到的问题写一写，欺骗自己还未曾摆烂。
Android R、S中的外部文件管理权限
想来是舒适太久了，目前负责的核心项目均是面向特定Android-Pad开发的，在 Android 9 已经躺了一年，已经快忘记了 适配 这一祖传包袱。
但还有部分即将推出的项目是面向普通用户的，顺便谈一谈这个 老问题
在 Android 10 中提出了分区存储，对于外部存储空间的读写，除了需要处理FileProvider外，还需要配置 requestLegacyExternalStorage 。
在 Android R、S 中，进行了更严格的限制，需要获取完整的外部存储控制权限。
作者按：笔者负责的项目受技术之外因素的影响，改变现有的文件存储路径的阻力非常大
判断与申请完全的控制权限
补充声明权限

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>

那么，相关权限如下：

记录 Flutter 开发过程中遇到的一些问题和相关的解决方案～
1. --no-sound-null-safety 错误 on vscode
上面是 VSCode 编辑器中空校验错误。解决方案如下：
// vscode 编辑器项目根目录中创建文件 .vscode/launch.json
// 添加内容
"args": [
  "--no-sound-null-safety"
]

// 完整的文件代码示例
{
  "configurations":[
    {
      "name": "jimmy flutter demo",
      "program": "lib/main.dart",
      "request": "launch",
      "type": "dart",
      "args": [
        "--no-sound-null-safety"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

// 之后重新运行项目即可

2. 设置 flutter_screenutil 报错
直接引用包 flutter_screenutil 去使用，会报错使用不了 ScreenUtil().setWidth(width) 等方法。
这个错误就是我们并没有按照官网进行使用。需要根据官网逐步进行。
这里我使用方式一 -- 在app中使用它一次。
void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    //填入设计稿中设备的屏幕尺寸,单位dp

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1. 背景
最近一个需求改版UI视觉觉得微信朋友圈的边缘高斯模糊挺好看，然后就苦逼吭哧的尝试在Flutter实现了，来看微信朋友圈点击展开的大图效果图：

微信朋友圈高斯模糊效果大概分4部分区域实现，如下图：

居中图片为原始图，然后背景模糊全图是原始图放大cover模式的高斯模糊，在上下两个区域分别是两层单独处理边界的高斯模糊效果特殊处理，因此有时候可以看到微信朋友圈在上下两侧有明显分界线；
2. 实践
在Flutter侧实现高斯模糊比较简单，可以直接使用系统的BackdropFilter函数实现，需要传入一个filter方式，然后对child区域进行模糊过滤；
  const BackdropFilter({
    Key? key,
    required this.filter,
    Widget? child,
    this.blendMode = BlendMode.srcOver,
  }) : assert(filter != null),
       super(key: key, child: child);     

Flutter提供了简化ImageFiltered实现高斯模糊，代码如下：
ImageFiltered(
    imageFilter: ImageFilter.blur(sigmaX: 20, sigmaY: 20),
    child: Image.network(url,fit: BoxFit.cover, height: expandedHeight, width: width),
),

通过此方式，可以非常简约实现全屏高斯模糊～，现在难点是上下边界区域的边界模糊处理，这里需要使用一个ShaderMask组件，在Flutter侧ShaderMask主要是实现渐变过渡能力的；

Android 异步加载布局的几种实现
场景如下：当我们启动一个 Activity 的时候，如果此页面的布局太过复杂，或者是一个很长的表单，此时加载布局，执行页面转场动画，等操作都是在主线程，可能会抢Cpu资源，导致主线程block住，感知就是卡顿。
要么是点了跳转按钮，但是等待1S才会出现动画，要么是执行动画的过程中卡顿。有没有什么方式能优化此等复杂页面的启动速度，达到秒启动？
我们之前讲动画的时候就知道，转场动画是无法异步执行的，那么我们能不能再异步加载布局呢？试试！
一、异步加载布局
LayoutInflater 的 inflate 方法的几种重载方法，大家应该都会的。这里我直接把布局加载到容器中试试。
        lifecycleScope.launch {

            val start = System.currentTimeMillis()

            async(Dispatchers.IO) {
                YYLogUtils.w("开始异步加载真正的跟视图")

                val view = layoutInflater.inflate(R.layout.include_pensonal_turn_up_rate, mBinding.rootView,false)

                val end = System.currentTimeMillis()

                YYLogUtils.w("加载真正布局耗时：" + (end - start))

            }…]]></summary>

痛苦
对你来说，读文献，特别是读自己感兴趣的文献，可能是件非常令人愉悦而激动的事儿。例如海华，他读博的时候我到 UNT 访学，跟他在一个实验室。他时常一边读最新的顶会论文，一边击节赞叹。读到开心之处，他会高声喊出来，还兴奋地把我拉过去一起看。我觉得他是把信息检索读出了《冰与火之歌》的意境。
但是论及阅读海量文献，试图从中找寻自己的研究选题，可能就没有那么轻松愉悦了。原因大家都清楚 —— 论文太多了，而且产生速度极快。即便是水平顶尖的学者，也不敢夸下海口，说自己读过领域内全部重要文献。因为就在你说话这几分钟里，可能又有（不止一篇）新的论文发表了，里面兴许就包括重要的新观点和新发现。这于是就构成了个显著的矛盾：

余生也有涯，而论文无涯。以有涯逐无涯，game over .

可是，不充分全面了解领域的发展，你又怎么寻找和验证自己的选题呢？你兴冲冲地给别人展示自己的新发明，一种有效降低界面摩擦提升运输效率的装置。然后别人一脸狐疑：

这玩意儿，不是叫做轮子吗？

对于科研新手来说，通过研读论文来找寻选题，还担负着必要科研训练的目的。新手在选择「读哪些论文」这个问题上，没有经验，整体过程可能要经历更多挫折和弯路。有的学生不愿意自己耗费无用功，会干脆把这个问题推给导师。

老师老师，您给我布置一个论文阅读列表吧。

如果导师对你的研究方向熟悉，这事儿还好说。可如果不巧你的研究方向是导师尝试进入的新领域，那么这件事儿上他能提供的帮助很有限。这么多的新论文，他也没有都读过来，又怎么去分辨其…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[卡顿分析系统
1.系统介绍
此系统拥有了端上采集两个维度数据的能力
方法运行数据：系统在编译期间基于ASM9+AGP7+自定义方法ID映射+自定义字节码指令集实现了方法运行数据的采集。
帧性能数据：系统在运行期间基于FrameMatrix+自定义数据结构体实现了端上帧数据的采集。
当APP发生运行卡顿时，系统可自动分析堆栈，并且关联卡顿帧的方法调用链，并作出记录最终导出至文件。整体基于协程制作，性能损耗仅需1%。
基于Compose KMP独创了多端可用的线下还原器，将采集到的数据做格式效验，并作出二次还原解析，进行了perfetto的二次开发，实现了可视化展示整体信息的能力。
2.思路介绍
2.1方法运行数据采集
2.1.1方法ID映射
由于系统会在运行期间会采集大量数据，所以需要将庞大的方法名映射为指定ID的能力，如下
//方法ID`方法具体全路径和行参
24`com.d.hookplus.HookApplication$onCreate$1.onActivitySaveInstanceState[android.app.Activity,android.os.Bundle,]

此处的方法名包含了全路径和行参，如果通过字符串记录是十分庞大的，所以在编译期间使用ASM技术将其对应成ID，降低空间复杂度
2.2.2函数记录能力
在ASM轮训期间，在方法开始和结束位置各插入对应的指令用于实现标记功能
override fun onMethodEnter() {
    //方法进入
    methodVisitor?.perfettoVisitMethodDelegate(PerfettoCentre.const.METHOD_ENTER, methodId)

0. 前言
之前写过一篇 《[-NDK 导引篇 -] 在NDK开发之前你应知道的东西》 介绍了在进入 NDK 学习之前，如何摆正自己的角色。时隔两年，NDK 系列文章开始填坑，在上一篇 《 NDK 是什么 | FFmpeg 5.0 编译 so 库》 中，介绍了 NDK 的概念，以及其作用。
正所谓，工欲善其事必先利其器，接下来将用 2~3 篇来系统介绍一下 CMake 及 CMakeLists.txt 的语法。CMake 这块知识是比较独立的，不止是 Android NDK 项目，一般的 C++ 项目也可以通过 CMake 进行构建。为了更具有一般性，将在 Linux 环境中，通过 C++ 项目来介绍 CMake 的相关知识，当然这一切也可以用于 Android NDK 项目中。
CMake 本质上是一个 编译工具，其最终目的是方便地生成可执行文件或共享库。编译的过程和项目的配置，由 CMakeLists.txt 文件负责定义。这很像 gradle 构建工具和 build.gradle 文件之间的关系，前者是可执行文件，后者是配置定义。
既然 cmake 是一个工具，在使用它之前，首先要拥有它。一般 linux 环境都会有 CMake , 如果是 Windows 环境，在官网下载 即可。在终端输入如下命令，可以查看版本号，有输出表示环境正常：
---> cmake --version
cmake version 3.16.3

前言
今天我们继续探索绘制与手势的组合的实践，不知道掘金的朋友有没有喜欢下围棋的，其实下棋也是绘制和手势结合的一个典型的实际应用，毕竟棋盘肯定是需要我们自定义绘制出来的，那么今天我们就用Flutter来继续绘制一个标准的围棋棋盘吧。
绘制
绘制之前，我们先了解下，围棋棋盘和棋子以及规则，在我们下棋时，每落下一颗棋子，棋盘是固定不变的，变化的只是棋盘上的棋子，那么在下棋刷新画布时，我们只需刷新棋盘上的棋子即可，棋子落子生根，落下不可随意走动，那么在手势中处理中我们只需处理点击事件即可，没有移动以及其他事件处理，Ok，有了这个思路，接下来我们开始绘制。
棋盘
第一步，画棋盘，围棋中，目前主流的游戏规则有9、13、19路三种棋盘，9路适合新手入门，而19路则是围棋发展至今的标准的围棋棋盘，也是各种比赛默认的围棋棋盘。
题外话：虽然只是19 * 19路的棋盘，但是就在这小小的围棋棋盘上可出现的变化绝对是一个无法想象的天文数字，以至于围棋发展了2000多年，古今棋局至今没有完全相同的一局棋，正所谓千古无同局说的就是围棋，这也是人类对围棋为之着迷的原因，正是这样的原因，人类相较于电脑一直统治着围棋游戏水平的天花板，直至2016年Google研发的Alphago问世之后，首次与当时人类顶尖棋手李世石的对局中，以4-1战绩横扫人类，人类统治围棋的神话也随之崩塌了，而赢的那一局也成为了目前为止人类战胜Alphago的唯一的一局棋，之后Alphago横扫围棋棋坛，对战人类再无败绩，也侧面说明了人类对于围棋当中无穷奥秘的掌握首次被人工智能超越，之后人类不服，约Alphago在17年与当时世界冠军柯洁进行的三番局对弈，结果Alphago以3-0完胜柯洁，随之Google宣布，Alphago将永久退出围棋届所有比赛，并将源代码开源…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[自《PasteNow for iOS 正式发布》后，已有三个月没有介绍 PasteNow 了。这三个月，PasteNow 也没有停止进化的脚步，分别迭代了 2.1、2.2 和 2.3 这几个版本，其中 2.3 于今天刚刚发布。本篇即是汇总一下过去三个月 PasteNow 的发展与变化。
支持 Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴
正如标题所说，2.3 版本带来了「Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴」的功能。这是 PasteNow 迄今为止非常重要的一个改进，不仅带来更加一致的体验，同时也大大提升效率。解决这个问题其实有点周折，我先简单地补充一下背景：

Word 和 Pages，因为其固有机制的原因（也许是 Bug），它不支持剪贴板的多项目粘贴。也就说是，往剪贴板里写入多项内容，再在 Word 里操作粘贴，你会发现只有第一个内容粘贴了进去，但是如果同样在备忘录（或其他 App）里操作粘贴，是会出现多个内容的。

PasteNow 的用户最早在去年7月就给我汇报了这个问题，当时我发现是 Word 和 Pages 的固有机制导致的问题后，决定暂时观察一段时间，因为也许 Word 在更新后会「修复」这个问题。
但是等了很久，这个行为始终没有发生变化，看来确实是固有机制的限制了。正好最近又有用户汇报了相关问题，我换了一下思路，看看能不能从 PasteNow 这边做点什么的方式来解决这个问题。于是还真让我找到了一个办法。
假如你是 Word、Pages 等的重度用户，经常需要粘贴内容至 Word、Pages 里，特别是一次性粘贴多项内容，现在通过 PasteNow 可以更好的做到这些了。请看视频！
 
更加全面和完善的快捷键体验
作为一个效率工具，能100%通过快捷键来达成各种操作一直是 PasteNow 重点优化的方向。在过去几个版本中，PasteNow 加强了以下两方面的快捷键体验：

支持将 F1～F12 录制成快捷键了，这意味着可以用更加轻松的「单键」来达成 PasteNow 的各项操作；
支持通过按下“@、%、$”等特殊符号也进入快速搜索模式；
「添加标题」和「编辑文本」操作，也有了专属快捷键，分别是：Command + T 和 Command + E。

相信通过以上快捷键的改进，使用 PasteNow 的过程将更加流畅。
iOS 版本的变化
三个月前的主要事件是 iOS 版本的发布，过去三个月，iOS 版本发展的怎么样呢？这里不得不承认一个事实，这个版本并没有达到各种预期，无论是我作为开发者的预期，还是用户对它的预期。
首先是我作为开发者的预期，目前 iOS 版本的用户非常少，日活跃用户最多时仅为 macOS 版本的 1/15。相当于 15 个 macOS 版本用户才对应 1 个 iOS 版本。这其实也是在我的预期中，但没想到会差这么多。
另一方面是作为用户的预期，很多用户对这款 iOS 产品寄予了厚望，以为也可以像 macOS 版本一样做到后台记录剪贴板内容、实时同步剪贴板数据。但事实是这个从 iOS 的机制上就做不到，并且在即将发布的 iOS 16 里，对剪贴板的操作将会进一步变得更难。
以上当然不是用户预期的问题，而是我在打造这款产品时没有准确的传达信息导致的，后续在 iOS 版本中，我将增加一个 FAQ 模块，让用户可以非常直观地了解到这个工具能做什么，不能做什么等等。
当然，我依然会尽力去完善 iOS 版本的体验，使其与 macOS 的基本功能靠近，比如在 2.3 版本当中，图片类的数据，现在也可以通过长按保存至相册了。这个是会比较实用且基础的一个操作。
小结
PasteNow 从 1.0 发布到今天，不过一年又三个多月，它依然是一款年轻的产品，我会继续按照既定节奏去稳步迭代，不断完善它的体验与其他 App 的互操作能力。
希望它继续给大家带来愉悦的效率之旅～

In my previous article about rustup, I showed you how to install the Rust toolchain. Well, what good is the toolchain if you won’t be using it to get more hands-on with Rust? Learning any language involves reading existing code and writing a lot of sample programs. That's a good way to become proficient in a language. However, there's a third way: debugging code.
Learning through debugging involves trying to compile a pre-written (buggy) sample program, understanding the errors generated by the compiler, fixing the sample code, and then re-compiling it. Repeat that process until the code successfully compiles and runs.

No one wants to write bad code, but inevitably bugs will be created. Most modern languages like Java, JavaScript, Python, etc., automatically print a stack trace when they encounter an unhandled exception, but not shell scripts. It would make it much easier to find and fix bugs in shell scripts if you could print a stack trace, and, with a little work, you can.
Shell scripts can span multiple files, and well-written code is further broken down into functions. Tracing issues when something goes wrong in a shell script can be difficult when these scripts get large enough. A stack trace that walks the code backward from the error to the beginning can sho…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VSYNC与画面撕裂
VSYNC即vertical sync，也称为垂直同步，是一种图形技术，主要就是强制将帧速率与显示器的刷新率同步，最初由 GPU 制造商提出，主要用来处理屏幕撕裂。首先了解下两个名词：FPS与屏幕刷新频率
帧率[Frame Rate，单位FPS]-显卡生成帧的速率，也可以认为是数据处理的速度
屏幕刷新频率 [Refresh Rate单位赫兹/HZ]：是指硬件设备刷新屏幕的频率，值一般是固定的，以黑白电视的电子扫描枪类比，比如60Hz的显示屏，每16ms电子枪从上到下从左到右一行一行逐渐把图片绘制出来。
两者要同步配合好才能高效的显示图像，可以人为帧率对应的是图像数据的输出，刷新率对应的是图像数据的屏幕展示，如果帧率同设备的刷新率不一致，而又没有采用合适的同步技术，会出现什么问题呢？可能会出现上述的屏幕撕裂[多帧的局部数据共同组成了一个完整帧]，示意如下：

理论上来讲，只要没做到读/写线性同步就有几率发生撕裂， 只有帧数据完整更新+显示设备完整渲染才能阻止撕裂，相对应的撕裂的复现场景有两种：
1：显示设备未完整渲染： 假设显示设备只有一块显存存放显示数据，在没有同步加锁的情况下，帧数据由CPU/GPU处理完可随时写入到显存，如果恰好在上一帧A还没100%在屏幕显示完的时候，B帧到达，并且覆盖了A，那么在继续刷新下半部分时，绘制的就是B帧数据，此时就会出现上半部分是A下半部分是B，即发生屏幕撕裂：如下

2 帧数据未完整更新 ：依旧假设显示设备只有一块显存存放显示数据，如果在GPU覆盖旧帧的间隙，也就是显存数据没有100%刷新的时候，通知渲染到屏幕，这个时候同样会发生上述事情，即使用了半成品的帧：撕裂帧。参考视频
所以同步锁的机制是撕裂的关键，必须有这么一个机制告诉GPU显卡，要等待当前帧绘完整，才能替换当前帧，即VSYNC，VSYNC强制帧率和显示器刷…]]></summary>

上学时最常有的作业就是限制在两千字以内的短 essay，需要引用参考文献，针对某个指定话题援引正反方观点，或者针对某个问题讲述现状及未来的可能发展方向。有时也需要联系同时在学的好几门课，从不同角度切入分析同一个问题。
写作的套路没什么新奇，我一般分成三步：

首先是看一定数量的资料，对这个话题的背景和相关知识有一定的了解，收集有用的信息；
其次是通过已知信息，大概整理出文章框架，包括大致结构、需要提及的论点，以及目前的发现如何支持这些论点；
最后就是整合前两步的发现，写完这篇文章。

其中前两步往往是同时进行，不分先后：了解了基本信息就可以开始搭建结构，在梳理论点和证据时如果出现了逻辑上的断层，就得找更多文献填补空缺。而只要这两步做得足够细致，写作时就可以顺着大纲一路写下去，行云流水毫无阻滞。

然而在实际操作中，却有件事一直困扰我。当时用的软件是 Mendeley 和 MS Word 或 Scrivener 的组合，若想要把找到的资料，按照文章的结构而非阅读顺序，依次放置在合适的位置，并且能够迅速找到引文出处，就只能靠多开窗口和详细记录引文位置来弥补单个软件的不足，稍有不慎就得翻遍资料库寻找某句话到底出自哪篇文章……非常痛苦。
因此，我希望能有一款软件，让我在查阅文献资料时有个「卡片」可以同时存放引文和我自己的总结，并且能及时链接到原文的位置，写作时自动生成参考文献；同时这个卡片可以自由移动，并组成一个思维导图，方便我构建大纲。
直到我最近发现，MarginNote 和上面那个组合相比，能更好地…]]></summary>

前言
从大二上学期开始重新拾起书本大量阅读，到现在差不多刚好一年。这一年里我迭代了许多次学习方法，从最开始的抱着纸质书硬啃，到开始用笔划线做笔记，再到把笔记收集在备忘录，接着开始换电子书，又经历有道云笔记和Obsidian，最后到现在这套自用的学习流程，真的是历经九曲十八弯。
在我目前的理解里，学习的本质就是接触到陌生的信息，然后进行翻译，转化为自己能理解的知识并形成长期记忆，最后在正确的情境下进行正确运用的过程。
根据上述理解，以下是我精简后的学习流程及相关工具。
第一步，阅读时凡是遇到自己有所触动的句子，立刻划线（or摘录）。【微信读书等媒介】
第二步，复述划线句，想象自己将要把这个句子解释给别人。
第三步，所有划线句定期复习。【氢刻】
第四步，根据划线句内容将其分为三类，不同类别不同处理。
     What——概念/观点——以卡片形式记录，不同概念多加碰撞。【幕布】
     Why——原理/本质——及时复习即可，重在理解。【氢刻】
     How——方法/流程——根据主题进行整合，旨在形成自己独有的方法论。【幕布】
第五步，想象每个知识点可能存在的使用场景，以图在未来生活中切实应用。

信息输入
这是一个信息爆炸的时代，我们每天都在接触数以千万计的信息量，但同时我们的精力又是如此有限，因此我们需要有意识地选择高质量的信息来学习。
我目前的信息来源主要是三个方面，书籍、论文和精选社区。
微信读书——腾讯最后的良心
我最早开始电子书阅读是在知乎，里面的会员专栏里有不少好书，但知乎不支持搜索书籍，书籍量也不多，所以最后还是选择了微信读书。在微信读书，90%我想看的书都能找到，而且微信读书没有广告，阅读过程相当赏心悦目。
此外，微信读书的附加功能也比较齐全，仅划线一项就支持荧光笔、直线、波浪线三种划线方式，且所有划线句最后都可以一键导出。

日式整理术的概念，出自《佐藤可士和的超整理术》，是一种能够指导生活方式或是影响工作流的方法论。根据佐藤的阐述，其整理术主要分为三个维度。

空间整理术 —— 讲求「物」的固定位置，归类，优先级的排序；留下或是扔掉。
信息整理术 —— 对文字、图片影像、数据的线形，树形或网状结构归纳。
思维整理术 —— 对「抽象」「混沌」等概念性、无意识内容的可视化、语言化或“意识化”；保存或是删除。

空间整理术 —— 「对所有之物的斟酌」
引子

有关于「量」

我自己从小就是一个囤积狂魔，所有必需品必须是用一囤一，对心爱的事物不满足于只拥有一种款式。横向上我希望有用时下同一系列的所有款式（也就是收集癖），纵向上我期待所有新品，对热门稀有款更是虎视眈眈。后来我长大了，刚刚对金钱有一些许自由支配权，我就理所当然地又被各种社交媒体上的“花花世界”掌控—— 大牌口红的当季热门色号、各种各样像调色盘一般的眼影腮红盘、成份奇妙能使一夜回春的护肤品、花里胡哨的快时尚单品…… 它们没有一样不在扰动我欲望的神经。我的多巴胺就在等快递的时候无限分泌，在拆快递的时候达到顶峰，又在切实拥有“美物”的一瞬间消失殆尽，周而复始，无限循环。
而我的懒惰又让我所能真正使用到位的物品少之又少，每天早起让我没有太多时间化全妆，没有办法好好搭配我买的每一件“潮流单品”。为了避免太扎眼的look，我还是会因为效率和时间而选择低饱和的经典款和各种黑白灰。可谓是身在“潮”营，心在“汗”，穿搭博主穿她的，我依旧我行我“素”。
我并没有因为这些物品赋值，反而被夺去了自由 —— 我被时下热门控制了钱包，被塞得满满的房间夺走了空…]]></summary>

于是小镇青年开始寻找兼职，最终总算托朋友的关系兼职了一份平面+3D效果师的工作。那时候自媒体刚刚兴起，小镇青年也步入了这行，不过也只能算是兼职。而后就是白天上班摸鱼，晚上画效果图，深夜为原创码字的日子。虽然很忙也很累，但小镇青年却觉得很充实。
几年下来，小镇青年也累积了几百篇的图文内容，虽然他在自媒体这行中也没有多少成就，也没有出现任何爆文，但他却获得了分享的乐趣。现在小镇青年开始折腾视频内容了，那么他又有什么经验值得分享呢?

Intro
首先是软件学习，Adobe Premiere Pro最好要会用，当然现在许多短视频也可以在手机上实现剪辑，比如剪映就是这样的工具。但个人觉得，最终还是要向专业靠拢的，所以Adobe Premiere Pro还是得要会用。

技巧学习上主要是转场效果。可以多看看别人的作品，从模仿开始。快慢帧和特效无缝转场要多学习一下，收集几套免费的剪辑素材和资料包。因为不是团队作战，所以精力会比较有限，所以脚本尽量参考别人的。如果不方便自己配音的话，可以考虑用机器声，比如剪映的文本朗读功能又或者是微软的Azure文本转语音。
这里推荐微软Azure云服务文字转语音功能。
azure.microsoft.com/zh-cn/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/

具体方式是使用它的试听功能+脚本插件来完成下载。插件名称是“Azure Speech Download”，以及Tampermonkey脚本。

01/ 携带 OLED 面板登场
OLED面板技术虽然已经应用了一段时间，但很奇怪的，就是在电脑桌面端，它的应用反倒是最晚的，之前基本是无论是笔记本电脑抑或液晶电视都有相关产品，反倒电脑桌面端比较少见，甚至导致把TV电视改为桌面显示器用的玩法，不过这个历史问题在今年应该就可以解决，采用OLED面板的桌面显示器会陆续在市场出现，比如飞利浦今年就带来了其首款OLED面板桌面产品【27E1N8900】。
飞利浦27E1N8900

OLED面板，肉眼可见观感提升
广色域覆盖，出厂校色，高亮度
超高对比度、高响应速度、省电
Type-C 80W充电，简约外观设计

沿用经典纤薄设计
今年上半年，飞记两台重要机型，一台【27B1U7903】，另外一台就是本文的 【27E1N8900】。27E1N8900因为采用OLED面板技术，可以省掉背光组件，所以厚度就是它的天生优势之一，也是如此飞记的27E1N8900，采用了279C9的经典设计，进一步突出OLED面板的优势：整机可以做得非常纤薄。

 
侧面就可以直观感受这台机子带来的纤薄感。

 
甚至支架也是对应风格设计，然后支架的底座也是经典的唱片底座设计，日常使用中倒是可以用来收纳。
这套支架设计看起来简洁，实际支持全向调节。

 
全功能Type-C接口
数据接口部分包含两个HDMI，一个DP口，一个Type-C口，一个音频输出，还有一组USB-HUB（黄色两个支持充电）。其中Type-C口除了支持信号传输以外，也可以反向充电，最高可以实现80W充电功率，所以算是全功能口了。
也是接口的丰富程度，所以KVM功能自然也是保留项，可以多设备同屏使用。

 
附带的配件，主要就是一个外置电源，数据线有一条HDMI线，DP线，及一条“魔术”Type-C线（可切换a2c或者c2c）。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
7月特斯拉官宣了消息，上海的32座特斯拉超充站开启了分时电价计算，每日的22时到次日8时，开始计算谷时电价，最低可以到1.28一度电，贵一些的超充站谷时电价也能在1.5左右。比起上海之前普遍1.8的谷时电价要低上不少。 

2022年作为纯电车补贴和优惠政策的收尾年，纯电车销量有了极大程度的提高，没有家充桩，还要解决车量的日常充电是诸多车主所面临的一个情况，本篇来分享一下使用野外第三方充电桩的体验与技巧。
野外充电桩的种类

熟悉纯电车会知道，除了特别低价的车型，市面上主流的车型都会配备两个国标充电接口，左边的是连接直流充电设备的快充接口；右边是连接交流设备的七孔慢充接口。

对于绝大多数车主而言，在外打野都是充快充的直流充电桩，因为涉及到变压器、安全保护措施、粗电缆，直流桩设备体积相当大，一眼就能识别。目前市面上的直流充电桩主要功率有30KW、60KW、120KW和特斯拉V3超充的250KW，这里的功率是指峰值功率，车辆实际快充保持在峰值功率的时间是非常短的。

当然，除了直流充电桩，第三方还有交流充电桩提供给车主们使用，一般会设计在小区、商场、办公楼地库和CBD中，主要就是给相对固定的车主使用，基本都是配220V电，一般功率是3.5KW或7KW。
两者相比，大电流的直流充电桩充电速度快，交流充电桩则对于电池更友好。目前直流充电桩肯定是大家使用第三方野桩的核心选择。
野外充电桩的品牌
品牌方面，宏观上分为车企自有充电桩和第三方运营商充电桩。

车企自有充电桩方面，最具代表性是特斯拉的超充站，在上海基本立足于百联、万达等各大商场，也辐射一些居民区、商务区和高速服务区。车企自有充电桩的核心优势是只有车主可以使用，不会被占位，充电环境好；劣势就是价格相对较高。目前特斯拉的超充站覆盖面最广，蔚来、小鹏、极氪、上汽大众系也都有充电服务区分布在上海，基本都是以快充为主，上汽系会…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[关于 Building a Second Brain 的概述
前段时间阅读了 Building a Second Brain 一书。正如名字所写的，这是一本教你如何打造第二大脑的书。而打造第二大脑后，就能释放我们的第一大脑，让我们的大脑本身应用在更为有价值的事情上。
第二大脑本身，能够帮助我们：让我们的想法以更为具体的方式记录下来，并且能帮助我们让他们之间产生联系，从而能够在未来以某种形式来孵化出新的想法。
Building a Second Brain 遵循这么一个模型，简称为 CODE：Capture, Organize, Distill, Express，总结来说：

Capture：Keep what resonoates 记录能让你产生共鸣和思考的任何想法
Organize：Save for actionability 把你记录的想法加以整理，形成能行动或者可执行的形式
Distill：Find the essence 找到所记录的事情、想法本身的核心思想
Express：Show your work 利用你记录的事情和想法，产生出经过你思考和理解的知识，并表达和分享出来

其中关于 CODE 里 Organize 这一块，有一个简称为 PARA 方法来做整理：Projects、Areas、Resources 和 Archives：

Projects：Short-terms effects in your work or life that you are working now 表示你当前工作和生活阶段里正在进行的「短期项目」。项目一词可能过于正式，你可以理解为一系列可执行的任务 Task 的结合
Areas：Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time 表示你在当前生活或者工作阶段要涉及的「长…]]></summary>
