YouTube is running a test that places its 4K videos behind a YouTube Premium subscription. In recent weeks, some users have reported seeing playback of 2160p resolution video restricted with text labeling it as a premium feature. YouTube has since confirmed via Twitter that those seeing the new restrictions were part of an experiment to better understand the feature preferences of Premium and non-Premium viewers.
It isn’t clear if YouTube will actually restrict all non-Premium users to 1440p video quality, however, the company did direct its users to leave feedback on the restrictions in order for the Google subsidy to “make improvements.” Google did not provide further clarification when contacted by The Verge for comment.

Each person has his way of communicating and describing things and this is why even if a topic has already been treated, it is not said that you cannot do a talk about it.
We would like to know everything and this often prevents us from addressing certain topics, for sure the Q&A time is the scariest part of any session, but you cannot know everything so on that occasion you can say: it depends!
When I prepare a talk I usually start with the list of topics I would like to cover and the tips I would like to share.
For my first speech, I started the preparation early, 2 months earlier, the result was that I studied a ton of articles and videos on the subject to be prepared for everything, two weeks before my speech I repudiated the topic I had to cover.
🎉 Here are my 4 tips about public speaking 🎉

But I’ve changed my mind. Maybe you should write a new JavaScript framework. And here’s why.
I’m currently building WTF: What the Framework? — a new tool to help developers choose their next JavaScript framework based on the features they need for their new project. The idea for WTF came out of the most frequently asked question in the Jamstack community: “What JavaScript framework should I use?” Whilst the answer is always “it depends,” I wanted to empower developers to drill into those dependencies and make a decision based on the type of project they’re building.

I have no idea what is the correct way to do things. I probably do some things really wrong, and I will be glad to learn that. Here I'm just sharing my experience and where I'm now in using Flask for multiple small-to-medium projects (all basically CRUD apps). Your experience may be different, and I will gladly hear it.
You probably heard about DRY principle. I'm not going into heated discussion if that's something you should code by. Actually, let's forget there's DRY principle at all.

Lets just say that I'm lazy person.

So, idea of writing code I don't have to multiple times is, well, not appealing to me.
But it happens. Especially when project is young, dynamic and you have no idea what code you will need, or how you will structure things.

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a standard for how computers, servers, and people communicate within a system. It was the first standard model for network communications and was adopted in the early 1980s by all major computer and telecommunications companies.
The OSI model provides a universal language for describing networks and thinking about them in discrete chunks, or layers.
Layers of the OSI model
The model describes the seven layers through which computer systems communicate over a network.
Application layer
Presentation layer
Session layer
Transport layer
Network layer
Data link layer
Physical layer
Each of these layers has its own way of working, with its own set of protocols that disti…]]></summary>

Apache ShardingSphere, a powerful distributed database, recently released a major update to optimize and enhance its features, performance, testing, documentation, and examples. In short, the project continues to work hard at development to make it easier for you to manage your organization's data.
1. SQL audit for data sharding
The problem: When a user executes an SQL query without the sharding feature in large-scale data sharding scenarios, the SQL query is routed to the underlying database for execution. As a result, many database connections are occupied, and businesses are severely affected by a timeout or other issues. Worse still, should the user perform an UPDATE/DELETE operation,…]]></summary>

Just do your own research. Just look on Glassdoor.
I'm sure some people have found Glassdoor useful. It probably works well for "Web Developer in San Francisco" because that's like 42% of the city population. Does that mean it universally applies, that the data isn't shit or useless elsewhere? Not in my experience.
Do you remember that after hearing the tip "just do your own research" for the first time, you knew exactly what to do? Well good for you, but many developers I know are not like that.
Your friend is asking an important question, she is at risk of being underpaid for many years in her life. And that sucks.

A database (DB) is a central system in which data is stored is queried.
It is used to query and store structured data. 
It has no relational or tabular schema.
A transactional system records transaction that encapsulates specific events, organization wants to track.
Here transaction can be taken as unit of small work.
OLTP relies on system optimized for CRUD operations, to support transactional workloads.
Now what are these ACID properties...
C stands for Consistency
I stands for Isolation
D stands for durability
OLTP supports live applications.
It  used read only system, stores vast volume of historical data metrics.
Data files are stored
Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) process copies data from files to OLTP databases to data warehouse.


Data in warehouse may be aggregate to OLAP model. Aggregate numeric values are calculated from fact table.


Data in data lake, warehouse and analytical model is queries.



Some terms we should know : 
Data Lakes : Large volume of file based data must be collected and analyzed.


Data warehouses : Stores data in relational database which is optimized for read operations.


OLAP model : Data storage for analytical workloads

Before we dive into the nitty gritty of setting Bun up, let's take a moment to talk about what it is.
Bun is a brand new JavaScript runtime, much like you know Node and potentially Deno already.
It comes packed with 90% of the Node-API function, plus it comes with all the fantastic Web APIs like fetch, WebSockets, and so on.
I won't go into the details, but Bun is written on the JavaScriptCore engine instead of the V8 engine. They wrote the code in ZIG, which helps with memory management.
Alright, I'm not one for long background stories and am eager to see how it works and performs.
First, let's install Bun.
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

Now create a folder, and inside add a http.js file with the following contents.
// http.js
export default {
  port: 3000,
  fetch(request) {
    return new Response('Welcome to Bun!');
  },
};

Now run the following command in this folder:
bun run http.js

And if we now visit http://localhost:3000/ we should see the welcome from Bun.

As Bun is still very much being developed and limited now, I wouldn't rush to migrate all your applications as some essentials still need to be developed.
However, getting a feel for it is good, as it might become the following big framework for runtimes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[安装 Java，使用 Maven 安装 JDBC，并安装数据库。然后，你就可以在 Java 代码中与数据库进行交互了。




当你编写一个应用时，需要数据存储是很常见的。有时你要存储你的应用需要的素材数据，其他时候你要存储用户数据，包括偏好和保存的数据。存储数据的一种方式是在数据库中，为了在你的代码和数据库之间进行通信，你需要为你的语言提供一个数据库绑定或连接器。对于 Java 来说，一个常见的数据库连接器是 JDBC（Java 数据库连接Java database connectivity）。

1、安装 Java

当然，要使用 Java 进行开发，你还必须安装 Java。对于 Linux、macOS 和 WSL 或 Cygwin，我推荐 SDKman。对于 Windows，你可以从 developers.redhat.com 下载 OpenJDK。

2、使用 Maven 安装 JDBC

JDBC 是一种 API，通过语句 import java.sql.* 导入到你的代码中，但要使其有用，你必须安装数据库驱动和数据库以与之交互。你使用的数据库驱动和要通信的数据库必须匹配：要与 MySQL 交互，你需要 MySQL 驱动，要与 SQLite3 交互，你必须具有 SQLite3 驱动等等。

在本文中，我使用 PostgreSQL，但所有主流数据库，包括 MariaDB 和 SQLite3，都有 JDBC 驱动程序。

你可以从 jdbc.postgresql.org 下载 JDBC for PostgreSQL。我使用 Maven 来管理 Java 依赖项，因此我将它包含在 pom.xml 中（调整 Maven Central 上的当前版本号）：

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
    <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
    <version>42.5.0</version>
</dependency>


3、安装数据库

你必须安装要通过 JDBC 连接的数据库。有几个非常好的开源数据库，但是我只能为这篇文章选择一个，所以我选择了 PostgreSQL。

要在 Linux 上安装 PostgreSQL，请使用你的软件仓库。在 Fedora、CentOS、Mageia 和类似设备上：

$ sudo dnf install postgresql postgresql-server


在 Debian、Linux Mint、Elementary 和类似平台上：

$ sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib


数据库连接

如果你不使用 PostgreSQL，同样的一般过程也适用：


安装 Java。

为你选择的数据库找到 JDBC 驱动，并将其包含在你的 pom.xml 文件中。

在你的开发系统上安装数据库（服务器和客户端）。


三个步骤，你就可以开始编写代码了。

提到自定义，改变主题或许是最普遍最直观的方式。

不是说默认的 Breeze 主题不好看。只是你的 Plasma 桌面可以通过新的主题和图标得到截然不同的外观。



让我来帮助你。我将分享一些好看的 KDE Plasma 主题，你可以从中选择。我还会在文末展示安装主题的步骤。

最佳的 KDE Plasma 主题

请注意，这不是主题的排行榜。也就是说，排在第三位的主题不一定比第七位或第八位更好。

1、Sweet

Sweet 是目前最受欢迎的 KDE 主题之一。这个仅提供了深色模式的主题，可以为你的系统带来华丽的外观。



它可以通过 KDE 系统设置安装。它还提供了配套的图标，叫做 “Candy Icons”，如果你通过 KDE 系统设置安装，这套图标将会被自动安装。


Sweet 主题


2、Materia KDE

Materia 是另一个被很多桌面用户喜欢的主题，拥有光洁和优雅的外观。它有三个版本：Materia、Materia Light 和 Materia Dark。



Materia Light 是一个纯白色的主题，Materia Dark 提供了一个完整的深色外观。而 Materia 则是黑色和白色的融合。

它也可以通过 KDE 系统设置安装。


Materia KDE


3、Nordic

Nordic 主题在深色主题爱好者中单独拥有一群粉丝。它是围绕 Nord 色系创作的，看起来既舒服又优雅。



它与 Sweet 主题是 同一个开发者，可以通过 KDE 系统设置安装。


Nordic

WhiteSur 是一个由 Vinceliuice 开发，面向 MacOS 主题爱好者…]]></summary>

Last week, I visited the world of the professionally installed smart home. This is the promised land. Everything just works, your voice assistant doesn’t try to sell you toilet paper, and you can control your whole home with just one app. Of course, you pay a hefty price and have to give up lots of control for the privilege.

Things got dark on House of the Dragon last night as characters stole dragons and other characters made super incestuous life choices. And all of it was done under the cover of darkness, leading many viewers wondering if their TVs were busted. 
But your TV is not busted. Your TV is a victim of the episode’s director, Miguel Sapochnik. The man can presumably see in the dark because this is the second time he’s directed an episode in the Game of Thrones franchise cast in such darkness people questioned their own eyes.
Back in 2019, Sapochnik directed “The Long Night,” a harrowing hour of TV where the many characters of Game of Thrones gathered to finally end the Night King’s invasion of Westeros. Zombies were decapitated. Beloved...

An unnamed source within Sony cited by MP1ST and VideoGamesChronicle pointed to a remastered version of the open-world PlayStation 4 title. 
Details on the remaster are scarce at the moment but reportedly include new character models, lighting, and animations. It’s also likely that it will incorporate new accessibility features, quality of life improvements, and compatibility with the DualSense controller, mirroring some of the improvements we saw with the remastered version of The Last of Us, which came out in early September.

Phil Shapiro
Mon, 10/03/2022 - 03:00

            
You may often hear someone claim a computer, tablet, or smartphone is "obsolete." When you hear such a statement, take a minute to ask yourself, "Is this person speaking an opinion or a fact?"
Many times, their statement is an opinion. Let me explain why.
When someone declares a computer "obsolete," they often speak from their own point of view. So, if you're a technology professional, a five-year-old computer might indeed be obsolete. But is that same five-year-old computer obsolete to a refugee family fleeing war or famine? Probably not. A computer that is obsolete for you might be a dream computer for someone else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux 内核 6.0 正式发布，但更期待 6.1

没有遇到意外，Linus Torvalds 于今天推出了 Linux 6.0 稳定版。不过，虽然是新的大版本号，但是 Linus Torvalds 一如既往地重申，“希望每个人都清楚，主要版本号的变化更多是因为我手指头已经数不过来了，而不是任何重大的根本性变化。”这个版本号的前一个版本号是 5.19，曾有提议将此版本命名为 5.20。另外，这也标志着 Linux 内核 6.1 的合并窗口开启.Linus 说，“与 6.0 不同，6.1 有许多相当核心的新东西”，比如内核对 Rust 初步支持、能够大幅提升性能的 MGLRU 等等。6.1 将于今年年底发布。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：好吧，让我们继续期待 6.1。




2022 全球程序员薪资排行榜，中国倒数第九

CodeSubmit 对二十多个国家的程序员的薪酬做了调查，前三名是：美国、瑞士和以色列。其中美国平均年薪 11 万美元。中国在二十多个国家中排名倒数第九（或者说位列中游），平均年薪 23,790 美元。而倒数第一和第二是尼日利亚（7,255）和印度（7,725）。此外，按编程语言划分：Go 和 Ruby 是收入最高的语言，均为 12 万美元左右；Python、Java、JavaScript 稍少一点，11 万美元。


消息来源：CodeSubmit



老王点评：中国程序员薪酬不算高并不意外。不过印度居然倒数第二，所以，印度的 IT 行业真的发达吗？




黑客利用开源软件和虚假工作机会进行钓鱼式攻击

微软威胁情报中心称，一个钓鱼黑客组织一直在使用木马化的开源应用程序和 LinkedIn 招聘诱饵来诱骗科技行业员工。他们发现该组织自 4 月底以来使用 PuTTY、KiTTY、TightVNC 等软件安装程序进行这些攻击。这和我们之前 报道 的谷歌 Mandiant 发现的情况一样。


消息来源：ZDNet



老王点评：这种被带木马的开源软件钓鱼的员工真的合格吗？我觉得各个企业是不是模拟一下这种钓鱼测试。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Auth UI. We've also added a bunch of features developers we're demanding from us...

💅 Pre built themes  - We will be making pre-made themes so you can get going right away. No styling necessary. 

🧰 Extend appearance of theme -  Not happy with the prebuilt themes? Override variables from prebuilt themes with your own styles.

🌓 Theme sets (dark mode) -  Extend and configure multiple sets of styles in a single theme. That means you can include dark mode, light mode, sepia mode...  

✏️ Custom css classes and inline styles - Inject css classes so you can target specific elements and also inline styles. A prepended ClassName can also be added to all elements.

📣 Custom labels -  Use your own text for any of the labels, so you can now accommodate for various languages, or perhaps different tones of voice.


What's the future of Auth UI?
We'd like to keep working on this and improve it for more use cases such as:

📞 Phone auth - Support for Supabase Phone Auth, so a user can input their OTP into the Auth UI to log in.

🏗 More frameworks - We've only shipped React so far, but we've had requests for Svelte and Flutter support.

🪪 Profile UI - Perhaps prebuilt UI for viewing user information, user profile, and user actions to update password, update details and so on.


One more thing...It's all open source.

View all the code here right now on GitHub.

Thanks everyone.
Feel free to leave your positive (and negative) feedback and comments.

Jonny,

微软的 Visual Studio Code（VSCode）可能是最流行的 开源代码编辑器，仅次于 Vim（当然）。

VSCode 通过提供几乎所有类似 IDE 的功能，提供了令人惊叹的“开箱即用”体验。 但总有一些事情是你希望 VSCode 能够另外做到的。正所谓“邻家芳草绿，隔岸风景好” : )

你可以在 Visual Studio Code 市场Marketplace 找到 VSCode 扩展插件。在 VSCode 市场上发布的扩展插件在发布之前会进行病毒扫描，所以这些扩展可以 信任。

在 VSCode 中安装扩展插件

你不需要访问 VSCode 市场Marketplace 网站就可以安装扩展插件。也就是说，你可以直接从 VSCode 本身安装和管理扩展插件。

我希望你已经在你使用的操作系统（比如 在 Linux）上 安装了 VSCode。

打开 VSCode，最左侧是活动栏。活动栏上的最后一个按钮就是“扩展”按钮。点击它之后你会看到大量可安装的扩展。



你也可以按快捷键组合 Ctrl + Shift + X 来启动扩展栏的侧面面板。

如果你还没有安装任何扩展的话，你会看到 VSCode 市场上最流行的扩展列表。

找到并安装某个扩展（图形界面方法）

现在是时候尝试一下 Linux 人谈论的 vim 了（鼓动的语气）; )

开玩笑啦。让我们安装一些对我们初学者更友好，可以轻松使用而且无需太多练习的扩展吧。

这是一个令人印象深刻的平台，许多专业人士都依赖它。然而，在 2021 年，Figma 通过施加某些限制改变了其免费计划。虽然这使一些用户寻找替代品，但对许多人来说仍然是可接受的。

不幸的是，在 2022 年，Adobe 宣布以 200 亿美元收购 Figma 让许多用户望而却步。因此，每个人都开始寻找免费且可能开源的替代品。

为了帮助你，我们决定编一份 Figma 的自由开源的替代品清单，你可以试试。

注意：提到的替代品不一定是 Figma 的完全替代品。我们建议你尝试一下，看看它们是否符合你的要求。

1、Penpot




主要亮点：


自托管选择。

使用 SVG 作为原生格式。

基于网页。

跨平台。


Penpot 很快被公认为可靠的免费和开源 Figma 替代品。

即使它处于测试阶段，在写这篇文章时，用户似乎喜欢它提供的东西。我不是一个设计专家，但这个工具的用户体验似乎令人印象深刻。

Penpot 的独特之处在于它使用 SVG 作为其原生格式，这很罕见，但也为设计师提供了巨大的好处。



你可以期待具有 Figma 的基本功能，因为开发人员提到该工具的原始灵感是 Figma，他们旨在提供熟悉的用户体验，而不给你的设计冒险增加障碍。

前往其官方网站或 GitHub 页面探索更多信息。

现在越来越多的设备拥有开源的 Linux 驱动，但却需要闭源的固件来实现功能，Debian 开发者一直在考虑对非自由固件采取最新的立场。在 Debian 社区前一段时间发起的投票中，方案 5 获胜：“改变安装程序中的非自由固件的社会契约（SC），采用单个安装程序”。即在 Debian 的官方介质中包含非自由固件，并在《Debian 社会契约》的第 5 点的末尾增加以下一句话以说明：“Debian 官方介质可以包括原本不属于 Debian 系统的固件，以使 Debian 能够在需要此类固件的硬件上使用。”

老王点评：连这么“顽固”的 Debian 社区都不得不向现实低头。




System76 的 COSMIC 桌面将不使用 GTK

System76 一直在开发他们自己的 COSMIC 桌面，准备用在他们的 Pop!_OS Linux 发行版上。在这个用 Rust 编写的桌面环境中，他们决定不再使用 GTK 工具包，而是使用 Iced-Rs 作为 Rust 原生的多平台图形工具包。Iced 是一个原生的 Rust GUI 工具包，他们在 GTK 和 Iced 中开发了各种 COSMIC 小程序以供比较。System76 称，“与 GTK 相比，Iced 的最新开发版本有一个非常灵活、有表现力和直观的 API。它在 Rust 中感觉非常自然。”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本教程将展示如何在 Ubuntu 中使用 MTP 访问安卓设备以及如何访问 SD 卡内容。


MTP，即 媒体传输协议media transfer protocol，是图片传输协议的扩展，它在安卓 6.0（棉花糖）版本中实现。在更新了安卓 6.0 之后，你无法将安卓设备用作典型的大容量存储设备，以便让你直接插入并在文件管理器（例如 Thunar 或 GNOME Files）中查看内部存储内容和 SD 卡内容。这是由于操作系统无法确定 MTP 设备，而且还没有实现支持的设备列表。

在 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 中访问 Android 设备的步骤

使用以下命令为启用 MTP 的设备 mtpfs 安装 libmtp FUSE 文件系统：

sudo apt install go-mtpfs
sudo apt install libmtp
sudo apt install mtpfs mtp-tools


使用 USB 线缆将你的安卓设备插入 Ubuntu。

在你的安卓设备上，在主屏幕下拉，然后单击 “触摸获得更多选项Touch for more options”。

在下面的菜单中，选择“传输文件（MTP）Transfer File (MTP)”选项：





在终端中运行以下命令查找设备 ID 等。你可以在设备的命令输出中看到 VID 和 PID。记下这两个数字（在下图中高亮显示）：

mtp-detect




使用以下命令使用文本编辑器打开安卓规则文件：

sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules


如果你使用的是未安装 gedit 的最新 Ubuntu，请使用以下命令：

sudo gnome-text-editor /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules


在 51-android.rules 文件中使用你设备的 VID 和 PID 输入以下行（你在上面的步骤中记下）：

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="22b8", ATTR{idProduct}=="2e82", MODE="0666"


保存并关闭文件。

运行以下命令通过 systemd 重启设备管理器：

sudo service udev restart


访问内容的后续步骤

接下来的步骤主要用于访问你的 Android 设备的外部 SD 卡的内容。

我必须这样做，因为文件管理器没有显示 SD 卡的内容。不过，这不是一个解决方案，但它是一种临时方案，根据这个 Google 论坛帖子，它适用于大多数用户，并且适用于我的带有闪迪 SD 卡的摩托罗拉 G 2nd Gen：


在 Ubuntu 中安全删除你连接的设备。

关闭设备。从设备中取出 SD 卡。

在没有 SD 卡的情况下打开设备。

再次关闭设备。

将 SD 卡重新插入并再次打开设备。


重启你的 Ubuntu 机器并插入你的安卓设备。

现在你可以看到你的安卓设备的内部存储和 SD 卡的内容。



总结

上述在 Ubuntu 中访问安卓设备内容的教程在旧版和新版 Ubuntu 中的安卓设备（三星、一加和摩托罗拉）上都可以使用。如果你在访问内容时遇到困难，可以试试这些步骤，它可能会起作用。在我看来，MTP 与老式的即插即用方案相比非常慢。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一阵秋雨过后，忽然就意识到气温的变化，于是给衣橱换季也不得不提上了日程。
从收拾夏日衣物并分批洗涤，到把冬衣填进衣柜、不再穿的衣服送去衣物回收，一共用了三四天的时间。其中大部分时间都用在洗涤和晾晒，专门用来收拾布局的只有不到一天的时间。
之前的每次换季都不可避免地会撞上搬家，所以正儿八经的衣橱换季还是第一次。以下就是我这次整理衣橱的心得，另有对消费和断舍离的反思，希望对你有所帮助。
第一步：辞旧
此处的「旧衣服」指的是夏季的衣物，还有一些不打算再穿的衣服。
夏季出汗多，为了防止汗渍沉积，因此需要在收纳前清洗干净。如果是年初的冬夏换季，需要注意的是不能烘干的毛衣等需要更长的时间手洗、晾干，可能需要提前预留更多时间。
第一步就是把所有冬天不准备再穿的衣服都拿出来，掏干净口袋后分门别类放进不同的洗衣袋里。我的分类依据主要是洗涤方式：只可机洗不能烘干的，以及可机洗可烘干，深浅分开，一共四筐。另外还有一个纸箱，专门用来放不准备再穿的衣物。
 
洗涤先从至少需要过夜晾干的娇贵衣服开始，然后是可烘干的那些。中间我留了足够的时间，以确保大部分的衣服都能在差不多的时间内足够干爽，可以安心放进储藏室而不用担心发霉。
接下来，就是把所有衣服，按照洗涤方式分类放入收纳箱。家里的教诲是「把娇贵的衣服放在最上层才不容易被压坏」，但以我对自己的了解，天气热起来的时候肯定直接从最上层拿衣服，所以在上层放好洗的普通衣物总没错；同理，冬装收纳的最上层也是轻薄的毛衣。
这个过程中，我没有把所有洗干净的衣服都放进收纳箱，而是专门留下了许多不打算再穿的衣服。关于我的「断舍离」，会在后面有一节详细讲述。
而收起来准备明年再穿的衣服，都和一小块檀香皂放进可密封的袋子里，明年拿出来再穿的时候，衣服上就自然染上好闻的香气了！除了檀香皂，还可以尝试樟木球、香挂，以及切成小段、放进纸袋里的线香，都是可以持续散发香气、且味道不会…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Julia 是一门高度抽象的动态编程语言。虽然它是一门能够开发所有程序的通用语言，但它有几个特点，非常适用于科学计算和数值计算。Python 在 1990 年初作为一种简单的面向对象的程序语言出现，如今已经有了显著的发展。本文将从它们在神经网络和机器学习的性能表现上进行讨论。

Julia 的架构以动态语言中的参数多态性parametric polymorphism和多重派发multiple dispatch的编程范式为主要特色。它允许使用或不使用消息传递接口message passing interface（MPI）或内置的 “OpenMP 式” 线程进行并发、并行和分布式计算，以及直接调用 C 和 FORTRAN 库而无需额外的代码。Julia 使用 即时just-in-time（JIT）编译器，Julia 社区将其称为 “即时预编译just-ahead-of-time（JAOT）”，因为它在运行之前默认将所有代码编译为机器码。

与 Python 不同，Julia 是专为统计学和机器学习而设计的。Julia 可以快速的完成线性代数的运算，但 Python 很慢。这是因为 Python 从来都不是为了适应机器学习用到的矩阵和方程而设计的。Python 本身并不差，特别是 Numpy，但在没有使用包的情况下，Julia 更像是为数学量身定制的。相比 Python，Julia 的运算符更像 R，这是一个显著的优势。大部分的线性代数运算可以用更少的时间和精力去完成。

众所周知，近年来 Python 在机器学习和数据科学领域占据主导地位。因为在 Python 中我们可以使用各种各样的第三方库来帮助我们编写机器学习的代码。虽然 Python 有这么多优势，但仍有一个主要的缺点——它是一门解释性语言，速度非常慢。现在是数据时代，数据越多我们处理它的时间就越长，这也是 Jul…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[对开源仓库的攻击越来越频繁了。


根据近日的研究，由于越来越多的企业使用开源代码仓库来开发他们的软件及解决方案，网络犯罪分子正在借此获利。根据软件供应链管理服务提供商 Sonatype 最近所做的研究，在最近三年里，受感染的软件包、以及对这些软件平台的仿冒攻击typosquatting assaults和类似的黑客攻击的频率大幅增加。

该企业在过去三年中发现了大约 95000 个有害软件包，以及超过 55000 个最近才使用他们的存储库防火墙公布出来的危险软件包。届时，这个数字在三年内平均增长了 700%。

该企业称，他们的存储库防火墙将通过融合行为分析和自动策略执行的方式，不断发现并阻止有害软件包及潜在的易受攻击的组件。此外，它还使用了人工智能对每个新发布的开源软件进行评估，看它是否会带来一些安全风险。而且该企业断言，由于开源代码的迅速增加，人工分析已变得几乎不可能。

然而，这与企业是否在它的最终产品中包含受感染的恶意组件无关。该公司声称，如果那些恶意组件已经被下载到他们的端点上，就已经太晚了。

“恶意网络攻击的数量、频率、严重性和复杂性还在增长。但企业不能，也不应该仅为保护自身而避免使用开源代码。” Fox 补充说：“但他们可以使用预防性的工具，例如 Sonatype 防火墙来保证开发人员的工作进度和软件供应链的安全。”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[布鲁斯･威利斯成为第一位允许使用深度伪造技术的好莱坞明星

威利斯允许创建 “数字孪生” 的 Deepcake 公司使用他的面容，利用深度伪造技术，将他的脸数字移植到另一个表演者身上。无需出现在拍摄现场，他就出现在一个手机广告中。他说，“即使我在另一个大陆，我也能够沟通、工作和参与拍摄。这是一个非常新的和有趣的经验。”今年早些时候，威利斯在被诊断出患有失语症后“退出”了演艺圈。67 岁的威利斯已经出演了 70 多部电影。


消息来源：Telegraph



老王点评：不但对于“退出”演艺圈的老演员非常有意义，而且，我们还能见到已经去世的明星们。这才是深度伪造的最好的用途之一。




因没人用，谷歌翻译不再向中国区域提供服务

一直以来中国用户还可以使用寥寥无几的谷歌服务，包括翻译和地图服务。而地图服务已经停止了。前两天，网友发现，谷歌翻译被定向到谷歌 .hk 域名下，实际上导致中国区域无法访问。谷歌承认，该公司已经停止了谷歌翻译在中国大陆的服务，“因为使用率低”。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：好吧，确实没什么人（能）用。




隐藏在微软 Windows 标志中的恶意软件

隐写术虽然不是一种新技术，不过，有一种恶意软件将其有效载荷隐藏在旧版的微软 Windows 操作系统的标志中。当加载器在被攻击的系统上下载上述标志时，隐藏在图像文件中的有效载荷被 XOR 密钥解密。如果成功执行，该木马将打开一个功能齐全的后门。


消息来源：赛门铁克



老王点评：虽然这样比较有隐蔽性，不过我能感觉到其中的嘲讽味道。]]></summary>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

数字文具盒征文活动 中看到许多将 Obsidian 纳入日常学习工作流的好文章，想必使用过程中或多或少都与命令（command）打过交道。所谓命令，其实就是在 Obsidian 执行的各种操作：新建文档、星标文档、打开大纲面板等常规操作，以及所有与插件的交互、使用快捷键执行的操作……这些都是命令。
和许多文本编辑器一样，Obsidian 内建了一个命令面板（Command Palette），用于快速搜索并执行命令。默认的快捷键 ⌘+P 唤起方便是方便，只不过这个内建的命令面板还是略显简陋了：只能搜索，顶多在设置中将常用命令置顶，就没了。它没办法记忆最近使用的项目，每次都要重新查找；并且文本编辑、核心插件、社区插件的命令一股脑儿混在一起，很多 几乎永远用不到的命令，由于首字母的关系，排名却很靠前。
尽管 Obsidian 一直在更新，也已经增加了许多呼声颇高的内容（比如 窗口多开），但还是没有往命令面板上做文章。你可能会说，常用的命令，用用快捷键就好了呀。不过我的系统全局快捷键已经很多了，所以除了极为常用的诸如加粗（⌘+B）这种命令，我还是倾向用快捷键以外的方式去执行命令。
那么本文将介绍三款优秀的社区插件，让 Obsidian 的命令更为好用。

写在前面：

本文若涉及快捷键，那么 modifier key 将会使用 Mac 标准的 ⌘、⌥、⇧ 等，Windows 系统请相应替换。
随着 Obsidian 的更新，许多插件已不再适配或是迁移、合并至新的版本。本文推荐的插件都是写作时点（2022-09-20）能够使用的。

Jim Hall

Awk is a powerful scripting tool that makes it easy to process text. Awk scripts use a pattern-action syntax, where Awk performs an action for every line in a file that matches a pattern. This provides a flexible yet powerful scripting language to deal with text. For example, the one-line Awk script /error/ {print $1, $2, $3} will print the first three space-delimited fields for any line that contains the word error.
While we also have the GNU variant of Awk, called Gawk, the original Awk remains under development. Recently, Brian Kernighan started a project to add Unicode support to Awk. I met with Brian to ask about the origins of Awk and his recent development work on Awk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
为了在上班前再抓紧时间享受一下旅行的快乐，我和女朋友一起去了一趟杭州和绍兴。十年前，我和父母曾经去过一次杭州和苏州，但那时正值盛夏，酷暑难耐，我的父亲出行时又是出了名的紧张和暴躁，导致少了不少游玩的乐趣，杭州在我心目中也并没有留下什么深刻的印象。在一位杭州「土著」同学的怂恿下，为了帮助杭州洗刷这个对她并不公平的心理评价，我决定再来一次杭州。
按照这位同学说，我们这一次来得正是时候，赶上了杭州为期两周的秋天，早来了太热，晚来了太冷。
她是没错的。九月底的杭州真的是——好舒服啊！
除了正午那几个小时，杭州的天气这几天一直稳定在很适宜的温度，在室内和室外几乎没有温差。哪怕是上午快十二点，大晴天走在大街上也只是有丝丝暖意，如果这时候有几阵微风从西湖吹来，送上岸边荷叶清新的香气和清凉，我就会情不自禁地把手臂张开，闭上眼睛，好好感受这让人舒服得跺脚的惬意。
因为我们这一次以休闲游为主，并没有安排很满的行程，这几天都是睡到自然醒，吃完饭中午才出门，所以行程上也安排得不是很有效率。作为一个旅行攻略太过勉强，但也确确实实享受到了放空身心的那种悠闲和惬意。
灵隐寺
食
很惭愧，这一次是摆烂的行程。因为不想时间太紧张，所以并没有专门搜一些当地人才会去的苍蝇馆子，吃的都是比较常见的连锁餐厅，外婆家、新白鹿、绿茶。我这个外地人尝不出地不地道，但坐着挺舒适，味道也挺好的。我特别喜欢西湖天地那家外婆家，旁边就是西湖，吃完饭去消消食也是一流的。
第一天晚上杭州的同学带我们去银泰附近吃了一家名为杭州酒家的餐厅。据说已经有一百年历史了。叫花鸡被一层壳包裹，需要客人颇具仪式感地亲自敲几下，而后师傅再帮忙敲开，鸡肉已经酥软无比，香味甚至渗进了骨头；熏鱼比我想象中的多汁，带着一种甜甜的味道；藕粉样子很好看，但感觉味道稍淡了些，响铃沾了不同的酱料味道很丰富。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2021年9月，也许是某一个灵光乍现的瞬间，也许是受到学姐和其他老师重读红楼梦的触动，我开始对红楼梦感到好奇：到底是怎样的一本小说，能成为一代又一代人终身治学的根基。考虑到我浅薄的文化素养，直接阅读文本收益不大，于是曲线救国，从他人的解读开启红楼之旅，所以试听了被高频推荐的《欧丽娟讲红楼梦》。

一入坑就被深深抓住了，198讲，每讲1.5～2h，听之前觉得太多了这怎么可能听得完，听之后感觉时间过得飞快，书里的时间，视频里的时间，还有现实生活中的时间，三条时间线交织重叠，构筑成一个亦真亦幻的世界。
这篇文稿不是为了总结300多小时的视频内容，只是作为一个外行人，分享在窥探瑰丽文学世界时的一些发现，以及这段经历给我带来的改变，包括对红楼梦观感的变化，对学问的深入理解，以及对自身心智模型的重塑。
书中的道理--超越风花雪月，草木荣枯
听完198讲红楼梦，更新了我对红楼梦的认知。目前我对红楼梦的理解，从它是一部关于贵族爱情的小说，变成了它是一部关于人的小说。
金玉良缘与木石前盟，映射着青春期的少男少女对爱情的懵懂。在我还没有足够的耐心去咀嚼优美的文字和艺术的行为前，一连串的言辞已经给我大脑一种“我已知晓此书”的信号：忧郁柔弱的林妹妹和纯真无邪的富家贵公子，爱而不得和包办婚姻，隐忍的，圣洁的；凄清的，热闹的；荒凉的，繁盛的……，构成了红楼的初印象：首先，世界并不只围绕着我；其次，即便如此，我也会被人无条件地坚定地选择。这种印象也可以被概括为：才子佳人模式。
曾经关注发生在人身上的情感流转，视频将我的视角转移到人本身。描写人物关系和个体命运的小说有那么多，红楼梦的精妙之处，是超越了风花雪月，草木荣枯。
每一个人物专论，都很容易让人产生强烈两个阶段的情绪共鸣。第一阶段，太真实了，这不就是我嘛。他们身上有非常鲜明的人格特质，其行事逻辑也能在我们身上找到影子。于国于家无望的宝玉，虽柔弱不安也…]]></summary>

Don Watkins
Fri, 09/30/2022 - 03:00

            
Not that long ago, docking a laptop was a new idea to me. Since then, I've set up two different laptops for docking, and I've been more than satisfied with how this configuration works. This article describes how I set up the laptop docking stations and gives tips and guidance for anyone considering the same.
How I discovered docking
I began 2020 with one laptop: a Darter Pro purchased from System76 the year before. It had been more than adequate, and I enjoyed the freedom of movement that toting a laptop gave me. Then, of course, everything changed.
Suddenly, I was at home all the time. Instead of an occasional video conference, remote meetings and get-togethers became the norm. I grew tired of the little square …]]></summary>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

首先，非常开心少数派上婉莹和甜食大大的播客制作栏目《100 小时后请叫我播客主理人》终于上线了，两位都是我很尊敬的播客制作者，之前也和两位有过关于播客和其他领域（比如音乐收藏和泉州故事）的交流，相信这个栏目一定会给到各位对于播客有兴趣的朋友很多帮助。
关于如何制作播客的相关教程，互联网上已经不少了，我自己之前也和生产力维基的白宦成合作过一期简单教学版本《小白和大耳的播客入门指南》，私下里我也在深圳线下做过几次关于制作播客的心得分享。很多教程和指南往往会集中在技术，设备，内容策划和运营等等方面，是一种「法」或者「术」层面上的描述，对于大多数的个人播客制作者，尤其是以兴趣为出发点的制作者来说，往往看了一些指南以后，就「一时兴起」录制并上传了自己的第一期节目，然后经历了一段时间的「方兴未艾」后，在某个时间突然因为繁忙的工作打断了「周更」的节奏，于是「戛然而止」。我自己的节目《对讲鸡 RadioChicken》也经历过几次这样的过程，曾经我也对诸如断更和订阅数减少（即使现在小宇宙的订阅只有 300 多个，最近几十个还都是各种社交 app 认识的）感到失落甚至焦虑，但经历了一些列佛系的思考后，我发现制作播客对我自己的意义，完全不在于「向外展示性表达」，更多的喜悦和快乐，反而在于「向内探索性成长」。
所以今天我想就此分享一些关于「向内探索性成长」的心得，希望对于各位对于播客有兴趣，甚至已经开始制作播客的朋友有所启发。
降低期待
我给新人播客制作者的第一个建议，是做好「降低期待，甚至不要有期待」的心理建设。我相信可能会有部分朋友开始做播客的原因…]]></summary>

Lokesh Mandvekar

Over the past few months, the Podman project has been reworking its process for generating Debian and Ubuntu packages. This article outlines the past and present of the Debian packaging work done by the Podman project team. Please note that this article does not refer to the official Debian and Ubuntu packages that Reinhard Tartler and team created and maintain.
Debian build process
Long story short, the typical Debian build process involves "Debianizing" an upstream repository. First, a debian subdirectory containing packaging metadata and any necessary patches is added to the upstream repo. Then the dpkg-buildpackage command is run to generate the .deb packages.
Older Debian build process for Podma…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我的 AirPods Pro 2 还没发货，我的 AirPods Pro 1 已经吃灰很久。AirPods Pro 的耳塞我越来越戴不稳，再加上比较「白开水」的调音，以及削弱后的主动降噪效果，让我觉得虽然 AirPods Pro 综合体验不错，但总是少了点意思，对我这个 PC 玩家来说使用场景也有些窄。
在 PC 上玩游戏，我始终不喜欢用头戴耳机，太大一坨挂头上，戴久了累，耳朵闷，还压头发。习惯各种无线 TWS 之后，我也无法再适应回去用有线耳机，有根线扯着，会极大降低我起身活动的频率。所以 TWS 真无线耳塞一直是我的心头好。
以我常玩的 PUBG 为例，PC 桌面端能用来打游戏的真无线耳塞，至少必须得延迟够低，才有可能听声辨位，这样的耳塞市面上少之又少。所以很自然地，踩中我的喜好和需求的怒喵 CYBERBLADE 在发售后，我第一时间就上手并主力用了一段时间。所以这篇文章，我想分享一些我的体验感受。内容比较主观，没有受任一方干涉。
先说结论：抛开前期我也不喜欢的营销方式不谈，上手后的 CYBERBLADE 本身没有让我失望。它主打的桌面端体验不错，实物的质感挺好，佩戴舒适度和音质也有超出我预期，虽然缺点短板都有，但它确实可以称得上是我用过的最好的 PC 桌面端 TWS，而且，没有之一。
我是不是说得太满？请注意定语——「PC 桌面端 TWS」。就像我刚说的，PC 桌面端、能低延迟打游戏的真无线耳塞，市面上的可选项就没两个，这个垂直细分品类太小众，愿意像怒喵这样认真做一个偏高端定位好产品的厂商，更是没有。
你可以说怒喵只是在讨巧，从成熟的音频市场，挑了个没什么竞争的品类来做，没啥了不起；但对我这种目标受众来说，有人做了我需要的东西，并且除了核心的桌面低延迟游戏体验 OK 之外，还做出了别家没有的特色，就很棒。

CYBERBLADE 到底是个怎样的 TWS 耳机？

Open source is a flourishing and beneficial ecosystem that publicly solves problems in communities and industries using software developed through a decentralized model and community contributions. Over the years, this ecosystem has grown in number and strength among hobbyists and professionals alike. It's mainstream now—even proprietary companies use open source to build software.
With the ecosystem booming, many developers want to get in and build new open source projects. The question is: How do you achieve that successfully?

这篇文章将介绍，我为什么以及如何将自动化数据处理应用到 Notion 当中。并通过我实际的案例，介绍自动化工具 Zapier 的用法，分享我的使用体验。
数据更新和维护的不智能，让 Notion 的使用体验变得糟糕
随着 Notion 功能的不断完善，越来越多的人会选择使用 Notion 作为自己的第二大脑。无论是构建个人的知识网络、保存整理数据信息、还是展示自己的数字世界的成就，这些场景中，Notion 提供的功能都显得游刃有余。此外，得益于 Notion 可以高度个人定制化以及提供在线编辑的特性，用 Notion 管理待办事项，规划日程，同步团队信息，乃至于记账、写博客这种更进阶的用法，使用 Notion 都可以让数据为用户服务，一切变得井井有条。
操作的不便
但是，所谓凡事有一利就有一弊。在 Notion 当中构建的精巧且复杂的数据库，不仅意味着数据在展示层面上的美观和应用层面上的便利，同时也意味着需要在数据的更新维护上花更多的时间和精力。
按照我自己的使用习惯，我在 Notion 当中搭建了任务管理的数据库和财务管理的数据库。这其中有着大量的数字格式的数据存储在其中。但是因为 Notion 当中并不支持直接将数据进行运算得出结果
例如，数字一栏记录的值是 100，并不能通过直接填写 「+10」得到 110，数字数据的更新是需要删除原有的数据，并把计算好的新结果填入原来的位置。

在 PC 端或网页端，这样的操作还勉强可以接受，但是在手机的 App 上，这样的操作就显得过于麻烦。更…]]></summary>

武汉水系图
沿江而行
如果你来武汉的时间只有一天，那去江边走上一天，便可以心中有谱地说出：我去过武汉了。那些或声势显赫或寂寂无名的景色，许许多多便是散布在长江汉水之畔的。
汉口江滩
漫步路线：江汉路-江汉关-武汉科学技术馆-汉口江滩
江汉路
每个城市里都有一条名号最响的路，在北京是王府井大街，在上海是南京路，在广州是上下九，在武汉自然就是江汉路了，江汉路很长，它的一头伸到了江边，另一头连着解放大道，被誉为「天下第一步行街」。江汉路在清末时期叫做广利巷，是商人集资修建来往贸易之用的。1861 年，汉口开埠之后，洋人也是看中了这里的临江的交通便利之处，便在广利巷附近的地盘上相继建立租界，江汉路便逐渐形成。现今江汉路著名的建筑，即是当年各个租界遗留的场所。
江汉路沿路与江汉一、二、三路，黎黄陂路，保成路，水塔街等道路相连。弯弯绕绕，一转身，便可以看到不同风景。黎黄陂路是旧时汉口俄租界上的街道改造而成，作为一条拥有百年历史的老路，黎黄陂路见证着滚滚的历史车轮从此经过，漫步在这里，主要体会宁静，在老时光咖啡馆里享受一段悠然时光，在小物商行里欣赏别出心裁的饰件，或是在路上发发呆，看一看那些时不时提着婚纱走过的新人。保成路是承袭了几十年不断演变的夜市，短短几百米的道路上承载了近千家小商贩，漫步在这里…]]></summary>

文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

从这里开始
目前我在用的笔记系统，用一句很简单的话概括就是：本地 markdown 文件 + Dropbox 网盘同步，同时用 Vscode 项目把整个笔记目录管理起来。
大概几年前，我正在 Evernote 、有道云笔记、OneNote 之间反复横跳。当时还没有 Notion，也没有 Roam Research，甚至 PKM（个人知识管理）都很少有人提及。
最后还是选择了本地 markdown 这种「看似不便」的方式，毕竟原生的 markdown有种种缺点（图片管理、没有 Metadata、不支持复杂排版），本地文件的方式摆脱不了树状文件夹的笔记结构……甚至在当时缺少非常顺手的编辑器。但这些年修修补补也一直用下来了，上面提到的种种缺点也都改善或规避，期间也尝试过 Notion、RoamResearch、Logseq，但这种 「基于本地 markdown」的笔记一直都是我的笔记系统基本盘。

 
这种方案的好处是：

数据完全属于自己，Dropbox 网盘 + 自己写的定时脚本备份到 Git ，双重措施可以确保笔记不会丢失，也能通过 Git 的历史追溯修改历史、查看笔记系统的生长过程；
最好的同步体验（Dropbox） + 最好的现代编辑器（Vscode）：Dropbox 的多设备同步近乎实时，并且增量同步非常适合 markdown 这种轻量文本，如果上网不便可以用坚果等其他同步盘替代，如果你用 苹果全家桶且能忍受 iCloud Drive 的同步1，它也是可以的 。至于最好的编辑器……还是看个人习惯吧，现代的编辑器诸如 Su…]]></summary>

1> 使用插件 annotator 时，引用的文本内不能添加链接

如果强行将关键字改成链接，就会出现格式错乱

我想要的效果如下：引用的文本能够给添加链接

2> 使用简悦剪藏文章时 ，文章内的图片是外链。如果图片是外链，那么如果外链链接失效了就找不回图片了

我想要的效果如下：将外链转为图床的链接

3> Media Extended 虽然能使用链接跳转到视频指定时间点，但是手写链接太麻烦了

我想要的效果：自动生成一个视频的全部字幕和引用，且每句字幕和一点时间点引用呈一一对应的关系

❗❗❗为了节省大家的时间，我在文末写了我常用的 Obsidian 插件的下载链接，这些插件中有部分插件的源码都是被我修改过的，有两个需要注意的事项：

被我修改过源码的插件不全是可以直接用的，比如发送图片到 Picgo 时的 url 要换成你在 Picgo 内设置的 url
修改过源码的插件不要升级，如果升级了会导致修改失效

❗❗❗再附加一个注意事项：

入门简悦的时候如果运气不好（比如我），会遇到很多问题，如果看了入门文章还是解决不了就到 https://github.com/Kenshin/simpread/issues 提交自己的问题，简悦的开发者回复消息还是挺快的（顺便夸夸开发者很积极，这很难得）

修改 annotator 引用格式
使用工具
Annotator：是一个用于给 pdf 做标注和跳转的开源插件
Linter：是一个用于格式化笔记的开源插件
配置 Linter
目标：修改其源代码，添加将 Annotator 样式修改为 📌

JavaScript is a rich language, with sometimes a seemingly overwhelming number of libraries and frameworks. With so many options available, it's sometimes useful to just look at the language itself and keep in mind its core components. This glossary covers the core JavaScript language, syntax, and functions.
JavaScript variables
var: The most used variable. Can be reassigned but only accessed within a function, meaning function scope. Variables defined with var move to the top when code is executed.
const: Cannot be reassigned and not accessible before they appear within the code, meaning block scope.
let: Similar to const with block scope, however, the let variable can be reassigned but not re-declare…]]></summary>

But all I needed to know was when my official government guidelines changed. In the end, that's all that mattered to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在以前的文章中，我对笔记软件和写作软件按照类别进行了梳理，参见《盘点那些具有特色的笔记软件》、《盘点那些具有特色的写作软件》。今天承接这一系列，介绍《盘点那些具有特色的电子白板软件》。
在思维导图、概念图之外，白板作为一种强大的思维辅助工具，正在日益流行。为什么很多人喜欢白板呢？
为什么需要白板？

自由。白板没有过多的束缚。就像在一张白纸一样。你可以在空白页面随心所欲地表达你的思想。
可视化。只需要使用画笔、文本框等模块以及模版，快速地将你地思维过程和想法以图文组合地方式加以表达。

事实上，白板也并非什么新鲜事务。很多公司一直在使用实体白板进行开会等活动。如今，随着工作方式的改变，人们在远程工作、远程教育等场景中迫切需要电子白板工具。
那么，如何选择适合自己的电子白板软件呢？我根据对于白板软件的使用需求，依次介绍本地离线的白板软件、免费/好用的在线白板软件、在线协作的白板软件，以满足对白板软件从轻量级到重量级等不同程度的需求。此外，还介绍两种与白板相关、特殊类型的工具：介于白板和笔记之间的可视化知识管理工具、内置白板模块的笔记软件。
本地离线的白板软件
Microsoft Whiteboard 微软出品的免费白板软件
官网：Microsoft Whiteboard 官网

介绍：协作式数字画布，可实现有效会议和互动学习。
优点：微软出品，免费、强大。并且，可以与微软 Office 软件生态进行整合。
Apple Freeform 苹果正在开发的白板应用
Freeform 提供了一个“灵活的画布”，参与者可以在其中将文本、照片、绘图、PDF 和其他内容添加到单个空间中。该应用程序与 Messages 和 FaceTime 密切相关。Freeform 可以在 FaceTime 通话期间启动，并且通过 Messages 反映协作内容。具体发布时间未知，预计首先登录 iPadO…]]></summary>

先给大家展示我去年的一个成果——《御赐小仵作》资料整理。大家可以看看下面这几张动图：

页面详情可点击此链接查看：《御赐小仵作》资料整理
《御赐小仵作》是去年的一部古装悬疑连续剧，算得上是暑期档的最大黑马了。该剧的情节、设定和诸多细节都很讲究，所以我觉得有必要整理一番。一来是出于自己对这部作品的喜爱，二来是想让制作团队的用心能让更多人看到。
去年6月的时候我开始整理，本以为只需要一两个星期，实则大大低估了它的工作量。我那会每天大概抽出半个小时，磨了整整5个月才完成。不过虽然是挺累的，但整理完还是倍有成就感。这次的整理大致分为5个模块：

每集的剧情脉络
剧中重要人物的介绍
相关的历史背景和知识
唐代的官职制度
剧中所涉及的知识点

这几部分主要是通过 wolai 的「双向链接」和「嵌入引用」来实现联动。
比如第一集的剧情这里，红色的部分是双向链接，引用的有人物也有知识点。跳转到人物界面之后，可以看到 ta 的简介，以及相关的经历。人物经历下面通过「嵌入引用」，把剧情里的信息链接过来。因为这部剧的主旋律是验尸和破案，所以几个主角的经历还会分出「工作成果」这一部分。

wolai 是国内开发的一个云端协作平台，用来搭建知识体系也很适合。
2018年的时候我就开始搭建自己的数据库，从最初的印象笔记，到后来的 Onenote 和 Notion，一步步探索，最后在2020年选择了 wolai。
我之所以会选择它，一是因为它的界面清新简洁，颜值高，二是它采取了…]]></summary>

掐指一算，试播集 已经暂别我们两个多月了，在没有南哥发车的这些日子里，我攒了不少读书笔记，决定自发的搞一期 “备播集”，大约等同于电视台里没节目可播的时候强行凑数的节目。
本期车长：@kokdemo
本期车员：@James_Tu
如果大家对这样的形式喜闻乐见，也欢迎在各种渠道找到我，大家一起攒读书笔记并发出来，希望能坚持到试播集回来的那一天。最后也感谢南哥对本文头图的大力支持。

@kokdemo 创业者们的自述
最近看到了巴塔哥尼亚创始人决定把公司“捐给地球1”的新闻，让我感到颇为震撼，在看完新闻之后，我立马去阅读了巴塔哥尼亚创始人伊冯·乔伊纳德所著的《冲浪板上的公司》这本书。
巴塔哥尼亚官网的公告-地球是我们唯一的股东
在读完这本书之后，我对这家公司的文化和理念十分敬佩，于是打算将这一段时间读过的一些公司创始人所写的书放在一起，和大家聊一聊。

《Salesforce传奇》：作者是 Salesforce 创始人马克·贝尼奥夫。Salesforce 是软件即服务行业（SaaS）的先驱和佼佼者，创办于1999年，主要产品是客户管理系统（CRM）；Salesforce 在纽约证券交易所上市，目前市值 1470.10 亿美元。
《发明》：作者是 dyson 创始人詹姆斯戴森。戴森是一家专注家用电器的公司，创办于1991年，其推出的吸尘器、风扇、吹风机等广受好评。戴森仍然是一家私人家族公司，没有上市。
《小米创业思考》：作者是小米集团创始人雷军。小米集团是一家以手机为核心的消费电子公司，创办于2010年。小米集团于港交所上市，目前市值 2366 亿港币。
《冲浪板上的公司》：作者是巴塔哥尼亚创始人伊冯·乔伊纳德。巴塔哥尼亚是一家主营户外服装、户外装备的公司，创办于1972年。巴塔哥尼亚仍然是一家私人家族公司，没有上市。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你有没有想过一个问题：为什么心理学家都喜欢拿老鼠做实验？
一般来说会找一只涉世未深的小白鼠，然后把它放到一个箱子里，还会给它准备一些食物，但是食物会连上老鼠可操控的开关，并且加上电击、喂食等各种条件变量，然后通过设计不同的机制，来看老鼠最后的反应，最后老鼠会因此习得一些惯性的行为模式。
实验完成后，心理学家会把老鼠的这些行为反应总结成规律，然后应用和解释人类的行为和心理机制。
这些实验结论都有一个隐含的前提，那就是老鼠的心智模式在某种情况下，等同于人类的心智模式：都是通过先做一些行为，然后从现实世界获取「反馈」，然后建立对世界的「预测」机制，直到最后形成了一个「稳定」的行为模式。
为什么我们一定要经过反馈、预测、稳定的路径？因为不管是人类，还是老鼠，我们都会遵循一种固定的模式——心智模式。

心智模式是我们简化世界后的知识结构和认知表征，我们常用它来与世界进行互动。
——百度百科

人类如果要在现实世界中生存，就需要认识并且适应所处的不断变化的环境。我们能够通过五官觉察身边的环境，通过短时的记忆去存储一段时间已经发生的变化，然后通过思维去归纳和预测还未发生的变化，最后形成一套自己的心智模式。
可以说，我们只要想在这个世界上好好地活，就离不开我们的心智模式。
我们可以将现实世界投射在心智之中，但是尽管穷尽一生，我们的心智世界也只能涵盖真实世界的很小一部分。
很多时候，我们以为的真实世界其实并不真实。
心智以外的“真实”世界
楚门望着看起来一望无际的大海，不知道海的对面是一堵天蓝色的墙，墙上的楼梯能够通往现实世界。原来自己不过是一个被设定好的角色，眼前的一切都是人造的虚幻。如果周边的环境都是假的，那“我”还是真的吗？

作为观察楚门的看客，我们知道他身处的世界是假的，但我们怎么知道没有人在观察我们？也许是我们的灵魂？或者有某种更广泛的神秘的存在在操控我们的命运。
但我这里不想继…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在正式开始教程之前首先说明一下目前国行系统的状态：最新版三星云（5.2.00.5）屏蔽了OneDrive备份的入口，直接删除了相关备份软件的服务。因此要在国行系统机器上继续使用OneDrive备份需要降级三星云。如果对Samsung Pay没有需求而对同步有比较大的需求，最简单的方法是刷港版系统。本教程基于One UI 4.1，国行S20。所有需要的安装包均可在教程链接或者apkmirror网站上找到。
在开始之前需要的准备：一个非大陆地区的三星账号，一个微软账号（需要是个人账号），一个非国行系统的三星手机（也可以是你的国行设备刷港版系统），以及一部国行系统的三星手机（操作对象）。
第一步，绑定三星账号和微软账户。
在非国行系统的手机上登录三星账号，然后在相册的设置里，找到云同步，点击按照提示登录微软账户。其中某些步骤容易因为网络原因卡住，不过由于我从来没遇到过，所以有需求的建议在酷安上搜索相关资料，或者全程科学网络。这一步很简单，因此不做过多阐述。
第二步，降级三星云。
一般来说，国行系统的三星云会被强制自动更新，因此要想使用备份需要先降级三星云。
目前在apkmirror上找到能安装也能备份的最新版是5.1.00.13，由于版本号相比国行最新版三星云5.1.05.9更低，需要重新安装。可以现在系统里卸载三星云，再安装此版本的三星云。如果不想重新同步之前的云数据，可以使用ADB直接降级安装。代码我放在下面（为了方便输入，包名我改成了123.apk）
adb install -r -d D:\123.apk
第三步，在国行设备上进行后续操作。
登录账号之后，下载一个OneDrive，登录之前和三星账户绑定的那个微软账户。登录成功之后就可以暂时忽略这个软件。然后按照链接里的方法在手机上安装lycan，这一步是关键，否则之后的操作都无法进行。
https://www.coolapk.com/feed/32708070?shareKey=YWUwNDI3ZTU5Y2FmNjMzMTVlN2M~&shareUid=964712&shareFrom=com.coolapk.app_5.0.2
下载「创建快捷方式」这个软件
【创建快捷方式】 ，打开之后右上角三个点勾选「也显示系统应用」，搜索三星云。点击进入三星云的活动列表，搜索「dashboard」，找到图中这个活动，然后创建一个快捷方式放在桌面。

如果此时打开这个快捷方式，会进入OneDrive同步的那个页面，但是会提示三星云需要更新才能同步，如果不更新就会强制退出。所以我们需要用到lycan屏蔽这个更新提示。
打开lycan，搜索三星云，在「服务」中将uploadtodrive两项设置成enable

在「接收器」中将下图三项禁用，三项名字均带有update

在「服务」中打开下图两项

此时重新打开刚刚那个快捷方式，就能够正常同步了。
成功效果如图

如果之后打开三星云又提示更新，可以按照之前的方法降级三星云。不排除之后的系统更新会屏蔽这个接口的可能，只能说且用且珍惜。]]></summary>

Open source software (OSS), once a niche segment of the development landscape, is now ubiquitous. This growth is fantastic for the open source community. However, as the usage of OSS increases, so do concerns about security. Especially in mission-critical applications— think medical devices, automobiles, space flight, and nuclear facilities—securing open source technology is of the utmost priority. No individual entity, whether developers, organizations, or governments, can single-handedly solve this problem. The best outcome is possible when all of them come together to collaborate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[时间切片 Time Slice 是延时摄影的静态表现形式：你通过固定机位并在特定的时间间隔内拍摄一系列照片，得到一组静态照片，然后在后期的时候按照时间顺序，取每一张照片的局部，然后拼接起来，便得到一个名为时间切片的照片。
2022 年 7 月份在梧桐山顶拍摄了一组日落时分的延时照片，并在后期导入电脑并使用 DaVinci Resolve 合成延时视频的时候，我突然想起一个朋友在 2013 年输出的一个时间切片照片。于是也想给我这组照片制作一个时间切片。
后期制作时间切片是一道很复杂的工程（比如，可以参考这里），随着照片数目的增多，操作步骤会越多。在正式使用 Photoshop 尝试制作时间切片之前，我就直接有个想法，要不自己实现一把？
事实上，使用程序来实现一点都不难：给一组照片排好序后，在一个大的画布上，依次取该照片特定的区域，然后绘制到该画布的同样的区域就能实现这种效果。最开始我是在 Android 上进行这块的测试，后来很快就完成并验证了效果的可用性。后来想了下，MyerTidy 虽然目前的功能只有「整理文件」，但它实际上是可以定位为一个「批量处理」的 app。
最后便有了 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新（暂时只有 macOS 版本）。
此版本带来以下的变化：

重新设计的带响应式布局的首页，为未来支持更多批量操作进行前置的支持
新增各个模式的功能介绍以及效果图
支持「延时切片」功能，正如上文所说的，可以为你制作时间切片照片。在下文会做更详细的介绍
进行了小部分重构和性能优化

在首页选择了「延时切片」后，你便可以选择一个文件夹或者一组照片了，之后会自动进行预览渲染：

 
默认的效果是，根据你的文件名升序排序，从左到右，不对图片进行采样来进行绘制。
比如你有文件名为 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg 到 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg 的 100 张图片，会使用以下顺序从左到右来绘制：

绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg
绘制 TIMELAPSE_002.jpg
…
绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg

效果如上。
 
你可以点击「倒序处理」，来使用倒序的方式来从左到右绘制：

绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg
绘制 TIMELAPSE_099.jpg
…
绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg

效果如下：

 
如果你觉得你的图片太多了，想以固定的间隔来取一部分来绘制，那么可以在「跳过合成的数目」来输入你要跳过的数目 X。也就是，每隔 X 张，只会取一张来绘制。

跳过的数目为 5 的情况下，每 5 张会选择第一张来绘制。
对于上述图片，跳过数目设定为 50 的时候（原图片总数目为 654 张）效果如下：

 
最后，上述的布局方式都是「水平布局」：图片以水平方向来进行绘制。
你可以点击「垂直布局」，来开启从上到下的绘制模式，效果如下：

此外特别注意的一点是，MyerTidy 目前不支持图片自动对齐。因此如果你的图片组因为前期拍摄的原因有部分图片对不齐，那么需要你先使用 Photoshop 等工具来前期做对齐（当然，相比做时间切片来说，应该不算太困难）。如果需求强烈，那么可能会调研并加入这块的支持。
以上便是 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新。未来会专注 macOS 下对文件和图片的「批处理」的实现，目前期望会做的下一个大功能便是对文件按照特定的规则批量重命名（比如整理番剧之类的，会很有用），也在思考是否可以加入类似「星轨合成」这样的功能。
你可以通过 App Store 搜索 MyerTidy 来进行下载。如果你有什么想法和反馈，欢迎留言。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1. 两个让我困惑的迷思
在双链笔记兴起后，PKM 领域一直热衷于谈论知识与知识间的联系构建。于是我们经常听到一种流行的讲法：我们的思维方式是网状的，笔记也应如此，传统的文件夹与目录分类已是旧时代的产物。
这种讲法忽视了两个前提：
并不是所有人都有能力在知识间构建联系，尤其对于一个领域的初学者来说；
大脑神经元虽然以网状的形式呈现，但人类的思考方式本质上仍然是结构化的；
20 世纪 50 年代，芝加哥大学教授布鲁姆提出教育目标分类理论，该理论将人类对于知识的认知分为了六个层次：

记忆：对具体事实、概念、术语的回忆；
理解：能够对知识进行转换、解释和推断；
应用：在实际情景中运用知识；
分析：将所学材料分解，明白各部分间的联系；
评价：基于对知识的理解，对知识的价值进行有效判断；
创造：将组成知识的各部分要素重新加工，产生新的模式或结构；

按照布鲁姆的分类理论，知识间如果要产生关联，对于知识的认知必须要达到分析的层次。在实际应用中，我们也许可以跳过记忆和应用，将认知过程的前四步简化为理解->分析，然而这仍然要求我们对知识有充分的吸收和了解。
以语法为例，若我们想要厘清中、英文之间的差异，则必先以其中一种语言作为理解的锚点。对一方的语法有所了解后，才可借此反思与另一方语言的相同、区别。
如此，作为一个初学者，若对两种语言皆不通晓，自然很难有相互关联的能力。再者，一个领域本身有其自身的框架，初学者面对新知尚且招架不住，更遑论还要再负担额外的功夫去思考相关性。
更令人困惑的迷思在于，当我们谈论联系时，我们总是通过网的比喻来形容知识的关联性。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这个大众觉醒的时代，我们常常听到「我们需要探索自我，了解自己」。但是，假设我们很粗暴地把人分为三种：认为不需要寻找自我的人（或不知道「寻找自我」重要性的人）、正在寻找自我的人、以及找到了自我的人，第一类人是绝大多数，第二类是少数，第三类是少数中的少数。
这其实也对应了我们认识自我的三个阶段。
第一阶段是我们需要觉醒，意识到探索自我的重要性。
为什么探索自我对每个人都很重要？
人是需要意义驱动的动物，我们天生有实现自身价值的冲动。但每个人的价值、优势是不同的。我的性格是怎样的？我想做的事情是什么？对我来说，什么最重要？我未来的方向是什么？我想过上怎么样的生活？我的价值实现在哪？这些问题如果得不到解答，短短一生很容易忙忙碌碌、随着大流就这样过去了，实在可惜。
项飙在《把自己作为方法》中说：

（瓶颈的问题）是回到自己作为一个边缘者、回到我是谁的问题。想清楚究竟我能做什么，我跟世界的关系是什么。我认为世界上所有的人都有这个问题，都得搞清楚自己是谁，否则都会有这种危机，除非完全盲目地被主流裹挟进去。

当我们意识到探索自我的需求之后，我们还需要方法，这就来到了第二阶段——开始寻找自我。但我感觉，很多人对于探索自我的方法却没有什么头绪。
困难之处，在于「自我」是非常复杂的，我们之所以是今天这样，受到了童年经历、社交媒体、朋友亲人、国家文化等等各种因素的影响，这些影响之中大部分更是在日常不知不觉之中就成为了我们的一部分，所以无论是从横向（各种因素的复杂性）和纵向（性格和价值观形成过程的复杂性）看，自我都是极其复杂的。
但好在，这几年通过各种各样的渠道和自证，我积累了一些有用的、可执行的方法，想在这里分享给你。
再多读几本书
阅读有什么用呢？学习知识肯定是好处之一，可是看完可能就忘了；拓展眼界也是的，可是没去亲身经历还是差了一点。
那最大的用处是什么呢？我认为， 是读自己。
在《活下去…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[个人日程管理的需求
在选择日程管理的形式或者app的时候，我的要求很简单：即先确定需求，再按照需求探索日程管理方式。我对日程管理的需求有几点：

任务与日程要在同一个页面；
尽可能随手拿起就能使用；
有较大的自由度，即可以根据个人需求添加备注等；
要能够自上而下地「俯视」整个日程管理过程；
随时可以逃离。

根据这几点需求，我开始了自己的日程管理尝试1。
日程管理尝试
1. 纸质日程本
本科时期，还在用着黑莓9790、z10等一些「非主流」手机，他们没办法与电脑形成一个良好的生态系统，所以没有习惯用他们来做日程管理，而是使用传统的纸质日程本。
当时，已经在用Moleskine的单行笔记本做日记本，对M家的本子很有好感，尤其是口袋本，非常便携。出于一种仪式感的传承，我开始尝试M家的周记本：本子摊开，左边是一周的日程记录，可以记录有确定时间的日程，也可以记录只固定日期的日程；右边是一整面的横线页面，可以写下一些备忘事项，例如可能需要本周或者下周要做的事情等，也可以记录本周的一些打卡事项。

后来尝试了M家特有的400页超厚日程本，一天一页，每一页都是当天从8点到22点的日程记录。本子非常厚，携带有点不方便；记录是方便许多，能写的位置也多了很多，但因为不是每天都有排满的日程，一些琐事写进去也没意思，最终本子留了许多空，总感觉有点浪费，尤其是年终总结的时候觉得似乎是虚度了时光一样。

后来也尝试过MUJI的月记本，但是总感觉没有周记本好用，我便回归Moleskine的周记本，直到我后来舍弃它。
2. 手机自带日程管理工具
舍弃纸质日程本的原因有两个：

设备和系统升级了，从「非主流」机升级到了带有安卓系统的Blackberry Keyone，自带的日历强大了很多；
当时正在读研究生，我们的课比谁都多，每天都被课程排满，而这些课程都写进纸质笔记本里不太可能，只把课程外的待办事项写进本…]]></summary>
