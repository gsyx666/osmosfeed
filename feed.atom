The WebView:
<WebView x:Name="webView1" Source="ms-appx-web:///Assets/index.html" NavigationStarting="WebView1_NavigationStarting" NavigationCompleted="WebView1_NavigationCompleted" />

Here you defined the Source and some extra events like NavigationStarting or NavigationCompleted for loading your JS or enabling JS interaction with your third-party lib (that you had to add as a reference in your main project).
Loading your third-party lib:

https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/52696#issuecomment-994137960
To be honest, I was also annoyed with lack of range functionality when I was porting my open-source project to clang.  I spent about 3 hours fixing other errors in a raw then I figured out that the last one cannot be fixed, and I must either remove all ranges or refuse the idea using clang. I preferred the second one.
My conclusion is, if you promise something, you owe it. If something is not working, that is completely understandable, but you should say “sorry” instead of "drop your tone".]]></summary>

Open graph was the brainchild of Facebook and was launched in 2010. What it does is that it promotes integration between other websites and Facebook. It allows other websites to become rich “graph” objects having the same functionality as other Facebook objects. Website masters can control the information that the website passes to Facebook via OG Meta tags. These tags are inserted in the portion of the code of the website.
After seeing the popularity of social media tags on Facebook, all the other major social media sites like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google+, started to recognize meta OG tags. To harness the power of Facebook Graph Meta tags, learning this skill is vital for webmasters…]]></summary>

In this post I will walk you through how to leverage AWS Step Functions to implement the SAGA Pattern.
Put simply, the Saga pattern is a failure management pattern, that provides us the means to establish semantic consistency in our distributed applications by providing compensating transactions for every transaction where you have more than one collaborating services or functions.
For our use case, imagine we have a workflow that goes as the following:
The user books a hotel
If that succeeds, we want to book a flight
If booking a flight succeeds we want to book a rental
If booking a rental succeeds, we consider the flow a success.
As you may have guessed, this is the happy scenario. Where everything went right (shockingly ...).

I love the GNOME desktop, and I use it as my daily Linux desktop environment. I find with GNOME, I can focus on the stuff I need to get done, but I still have flexibility to make the desktop look and act the way I want.
The GNOME Project recently released GNOME 43, the latest version of the GNOME desktop. I met with GNOME developer Emmanuele Bassi to ask a few questions about this latest release:
Jim Hall (Jim): GNOME has lots of great desktop features. What are some of the new features in GNOME 43?
Emmanuele Bassi (Emmanuele): GNOME 43 has a complete redesign of the system status menu in the Shell. The new design is meant to give quick and easy access to various settings: network connections and VPNs; audio input and …]]></summary>

One of my absolute favorite frameworks for building cloud-based, serverless applications is the AWS Amplify framework. I have been spending the better part of this past year learning the ins-and-outs of the framework, as well as extending each of the tools in the tech stack to incorporate new integrations, data models, front-end experiences, and event-driven architectures.
This framework, to me, really conceptualizes what makes serverless applications so powerful. Within the framework, you leverage the @aws-amplify CLI (command line interface) to provision resources in the cloud right from the command line. Most importantly, these resources are deployed with the right IAM (Identity and Access Management) authorization rules and abide by the AWS princ…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本指南解释了在 Fedora Linux 发行版中启用第三方软件仓库 RPM Fusion 的步骤。


RPM Fusion 软件仓库是一个社区维护的软件仓库，它为 Fedora Linux 提供额外的软件包，这些软件包不是由 Fedora 官方团队分发，例如 DVD 播放、媒体播放、来自 GNOME 和 KDE 的软件等。这是因为许可证、其他法律原因和特定国家/地区的软件规范而导致的。

RPM Fusion 为 Red Hat Enterprise Linux（RHEL）以及 Fedora 提供了 .rpm 包。

本指南介绍了在 Fedora Linux 中启用 RPM Fusion 仓库所需的步骤。本指南适用于所有 Fedora 发行版本。

这在所有当前支持的 Fedora 版本（35、36 和 37）中进行了测试。



如何在 Fedora Linux、RHEL、CentOS 中启用 RPM Fusion 仓库

RPM Fusion 有两种版本的仓库：自由和非自由。

顾名思义，自由版包含软件包的自由版本，非自由版包含封闭源代码的编译软件包和“非商业”开源软件。

在继续之前，首先检查你是否安装了 RPM fusion。打开终端并运行以下命令。

dnf repolist | grep rpmfusion


如果安装了 RPM，你应该会看到如下所示的消息。就不用下面的步骤。如果未安装，你可以继续执行以下步骤。



打开终端并根据你的操作系统版本运行以下命令。请注意，这些命令包含自由和非自由版本。如果你愿意，你可以在运行时省略下面的任何一个。

So before NodeJS one can't run JavaScript Code to our system.Now don't confuse here.Before NodeJS developers can write JS Code but in order to see the Working they have to run it on the Browser like we will do when we initially learning HTML, CSS , JavaScript and somehow even now. 
So, When NodeJS was Introduced one can run Javascript code outside the Browser i.e. in our Terminals in any Operating System.
Thus,
For what Purpose we use NodeJS ?
Node.js is widely used for creating  back-end of applications. 
For Example : Express.js which is a NodeJS web application framework used to build the back-end of classic web applications.
Why you Choose NodeJS from Tonnes  of Back-End Development Tools ?
So, here I am not Saying that NodeJS is the best for Backend Development and other are less efficient than this.But if someone who is a Front-End Developer, Javascript Developer, ReactJS Developer or know Javascript Libraries and Framework then NodeJS is boon for him/her as they don't need to learn any new language.
Node.js follows a single threaded model  which means there is no possibility of Deadlocks in this.
Moreover , Node.js is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, so its library is very fast in code execution.
That's all about it's Introduction. I will come up with more Blogs related to MERN Technology soon.]]></summary>

Git is pretty much used by every developer nowadays. Personally, even after using it for approximately two years, I continue to discover new git features. So here are some of the commands I discovered, and seems they aren't popular enough. Without wasting time, let's dive into it.
git log a useful tool for looking back and reading the history of every action taken with a repository. A git log's multiple settings can be utilized to narrow down history. The git log typically contains a list of commits. And sometimes the list is so big it's hard to find anything we need. Let me show you an easier way to do the same, but the output is short yet brief.
It's super helpful to check the latest commits. With the --oneline flag, each commit is reduced to a single line. It just shows t…]]></summary>

敲黑板：PyLint 实际上很好！

&ldquoyLint 可以拯救你的生命”，这是一句夸张的描述，但没有你想象的那么夸张。PyLint 可以让你远离非常难找到的和复杂的缺陷。最差的情况下，它只可以节省测试运行的时间。最好的情况下，它可以帮你避免生产环境中复杂的错误。

优点

我不好意思说这种情况是多么普遍。测试的命名总是那么奇怪：没有人关心这个名称，而且通常也找不到一个自然的名称。例如以下代码：

def test_add_small():
    # Math, am I right?
    assert 1 + 1 == 3
    
def test_add_large():
    assert 5 + 6 == 11
    
def test_add_small():
    assert 1 + 10 == 11


测试生效：

collected 2 items                                                                         
test.py .. 
2 passed


但问题是：如果你覆盖了一个测试的名称，测试框架将愉快地跳过这个测试！

实际上，这些文件可能有数百行，而添加新测试的人可能并不知道所有的名称。除非有人仔细查看测试输出，否则一切看起来都很好。

最糟糕的是，被覆盖测试的添加、被覆盖测试造成的破坏，以及连锁反应的问题可能要几天、几月甚至几年才能发现。

PyLint 会找到它

就像一个好朋友一样，PyLint 可以帮助你。

As a freelancer, you ended up subscribing to many services like Adobe CC, Envato Elements, Render forest, etc... Once you get to the cap of your monthly payments budget, you can't keep adding tools that require monthly payments as well! So I was looking for an alternative powerful enough to handle my needs and that doesn't offer a subscription only deal. I found Pasty! This app was more powerful than Paste, and it also offers a one time payment deal. It changed my life and put me back on track, giving me the productivity speed and useful features I was used to with Paste app. If you're like me and need an alternative without a monthly payment, Pasty is without a doubt better, faster and super useful. I recommend this app 100%. (It's so good that it moves me to create my first post here in Product Hunt and I don't even know the developer!)

“The hell with it,” Musk writes on Twitter. “Even though Starlink is still losing money & other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we’ll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free.”

Apple is working on a dock for the iPad that would allow the device to function as a smart display and speaker, according to a report to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The company reportedly plans on introducing the capability as soon as next year, converting the iPad into an Amazon Echo Show-like device that you can set atop a counter or nightstand.
Amazon already does something similar with its Fire tablets, as the company lets users place the devices into a charging dock to prop them up like a smart display. Even Google announced a docking accessory for its upcoming Pixel Tablet last week, which is supposed to serve as both a magnetic charging station and speaker. Once the tablet’s in place, it’ll function like a Nest Hub Max, letting you...

To stand out from the many over-ear headsets that Razer has released for consoles, the company is bringing a new version of its Hammerhead wireless earbuds to PlayStation and Xbox in November for $149.99. Each console is getting its own color treatment of the Hammerhead HyperSpeed (white with blue accents for PlayStation, black with green for Xbox). This model features active noise cancellation — and of course, Chroma RGB lighting effects. Included with each is a USB-C audio transmitter along with a USB-C-to-A adapter since the Series X / S consoles don’t have a USB-C port.
As you might have anticipated, each version handles connectivity a little differently but both support 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth 5.2 for pairing with mobile...

Razer is finally showing off the Edge, its portable Android gaming handheld. Good news: it looks a lot better than the last time we saw it in December 2021. There’s a lot to go over with this one. The Edge will release in a Wi-Fi-only version for $399.99 in January 2023, followed by a 5G-ready version through Verizon in early 2023. It’ll support the carrier’s ultra wideband and sub-6GHz networks. Razer’s following the Steam Deck reservation model, allowing people to pay $5 to reserve an Edge.
It’s meant to be a great device for cloud game streaming through Xbox Cloud Gaming or Nvidia GeForce Now. Razer says that the Edge supports up to 144 frames per second through the Steam Link app when you’re streaming PC games locally. The Edge runs...

Horizon Worlds, Meta’s social universe set in virtual reality (VR), is reportedly struggling to gain and keep users. According to internal documents obtained by the Wall Street Journal, Horizon Worlds currently has around 200,000 monthly active users, a dip from the 300,000-user milestone Meta confirmed it hit back in February.
Horizon Worlds lets users create (or visit) spaces where they can hang out, play games, meet other people, and chat with friends. The platform’s userbase actually increased tenfold following its expansion to all Quest users in the US and Canada last December, something the popularity of Meta’s Quest 2 headset during last year’s holiday shopping season likely contributed to as well.
But now it looks like Meta’s...

As expected, the sun has set on Amazon’s Prime Early Access sale, along with the litany of counter sales running elsewhere. Despite this, however, there are still plenty of solid deals to check out at Amazon and Best Buy, many of which are holdouts from earlier in the week. Some of these products may not be available for their lowest prices ever, true, but they’re still worth a look if you missed them earlier this week.
A bit of housekeeping before we dig in, though. While there are plenty of other deals available today, you can also sign up for our sweepstakes for a chance to win a sack full of free gear hand-picked by The Verge’s deals team. Just head over to this page and sign up before the morning of October 19th to throw your hat in...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canonical 在 apt 命令中为其 Ubuntu Pro 打广告

之前我们 报道 过，Canonical 公司提供的 Ubuntu Pro 支持现在可供多达五台机器免费使用，为这些机器提供十年的支持服务。这本来是一件好事，但如果你从命令行用 apt 命令更新时，你就会看到 Canonical 发布的宣传这项免费服务的广告。这让一些用户非常恼火。Canonical 在自作主张向 Ubuntu 用户显示广告方面“劣迹斑斑”。上一次在服务器的登录屏幕中显示了促销信息，而在十年前，它还在桌面搜索结果中显示了亚马逊的广告。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：我觉得，可能 Canonical 的初衷或许是好的，但是这种侵入式广告的方式太糟糕。或许，Ubuntu 应该在其桌面版和服务器版中专门提供一个通告服务，以使关注 Ubuntu 相关信息的人可以主动订阅。




黑客利用无人机，通过 Wi-Fi 远程渗透了金融公司内网

安保人员在美国东海岸一家专注于私人投资的金融公司的大楼顶层发现了两架 DJI 无人机，一架虽然炸机但仍在运行，而另一架实现了安全着陆。两架无人机上被加装了渗透套件，包含一台树莓派、GPD 迷你笔记本电脑、4G 调制解调器、Wi-Fi 设备、几块电池，以及一套网络渗透测试设备。攻击者利用该装置拦截了该公司员工的凭据，利用员工 MAC 地址和访问凭据、从屋顶侵入了该公司的内网。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这真是无孔不入，之前曾经有黑客靠近办公室渗透 Wi-Fi 的，现在居然连无人机都用上了。




PostgreSQL 15 发布

新版本进一步改进了性能，主要新特性包括：支持 SQL MERGE 命令；改进内存中和磁盘上的排序性能，最高提升 400%；启用了 Zstd 和 LZ4 压缩支持，并支持写前日志文件；支持 pg_basebackup 期间执行服务器端压缩；等等。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：我当时学习的第一个开源数据库就是 PG，可惜后来它的风头被 MySQL 抢走了，但是实际上 PG 更优秀。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我一直在努力学习关于 IPv6 的相关知识。一方面，IPv6 的基础概念是很简单的（没有足够的 IPv4 地址可以满足互联网上的所有设备，所以人们发明了 IPv6！每个人都能有足够的 IPv6 地址！）

但是当我试图进一步理解它时，我遇到了很多问题。其中一个问题是：为什么 twitter.com 不支持 IPv6。假设，网站不支持 IPv6 并不会造成很多困难，那么为什么网站需要支持 IPv6 呢？

我在 Twitter 上询问了很多人 为什么他们的服务器支持 IPv6，我得到了很多很好的答案，我将在这里总结一下。事先说明一下，因为我对 IPv6 基本上毫无经验，所以下面所总结的理由中可能会有写得不准确的地方，请大家多多包涵。

首先，我想解释一下为什么 twitter.com 可以不支持 IPv6，因为这是最先让我困惑的地方。

怎么知道 twitter.com 不支持 IPv6 呢？

你可以使用 dig 命令以 AAAA 的选项查询某一个域名的 IPv6 地址记录，如果没有记录，则表明该域名不支持 IPv6。除了 twitter.com，还有一些大型网站，如 github.com 和 stripe.com 也不支持 IPv6。

$ dig AAAA twitter.com
(empty response)
$ dig AAAA github.com
(empty response)
$ dig AAAA stripe.com
(empty response)


为什么 twitter.com 仍然适用于 IPv6 用户？

我发现这真的很令人困惑。我一直听说因为 IPv4 地址已经用完了，从而很多互联网用户被迫要使用 IPv6 地址。但如果这是真的，twitter.com 怎么能继续为那些没有 IPv6 支持的人提供服务呢？以下内容…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VirtualBox 7.0 是自其上次大版本更新以来的一次重大升级。有一些不错的进步！




对 VirtualBox 来说，这是一次大的升级。这个版本值得关注，因为我们在最近几年没有看到过它的大版本更新。

对于那些不熟悉 VirtualBox 的人来说，它是一个由 甲骨文公司 开发的虚拟化软件。

随着 VirtualBox 7.0 的推出，增加了许多新功能。

让我们来看看其中最关键的一些。

VirtualBox 7.0 的新内容



VirtualBox 7.0 是一次有益的升级。有图标更新、主题改进，以及一些关键的亮点，包括：


一个显示运行中的客体Guest的性能统计的新工具。

支持安全启动。

支持全加密虚拟机Full VM Encryption（通过 CLI）。

重新设计的新建虚拟机向导。


通过命令行管理的全加密虚拟机

虚拟机（VM）现在可以完全加密了，但只能通过命令行界面。

这也包括加密的配置日志和暂存状态。

截至目前，用户只能通过命令行界面对机器进行加密，未来将增加不同的方式。

新的资源监控工具



新的实用程序可以让你监控性能统计，如 CPU、内存使用、磁盘 I/O 等。它将列出所有正在运行的客体的性能统计。

这不是最吸引人的补充，但很有用。

改进的主题支持

对主题的支持在所有平台上都得到了改进。在 Linux 和 macOS 上使用原生引擎，而在 Windows 上，有一个单独的实现。

对安全启动的支持

VirtualBox 现在支持安全启动，增强了对恶意软件、病毒和间谍软件的安全性。

它还将防止虚拟机使用损坏的驱动程序启动，这对企业应用非常重要。

使用那些需要安全启动才能运行的操作系统的用户现在应该能够轻松创建虚拟机了。

其他变化

VirtualBox 7.0 是一次重大的升级。因此，有几个功能的增加和全面的完善。

例如，新件虚拟机向导现在已经重新设计，以整合无人值守的客体操作系统安装。



其他改进包括：


云端虚拟机现在可以被添加到 VirtualBox，并作为本地虚拟机进行控制。

VirtualBox 的图标在此版本中得到了更新。

引入了一个新的 3D 栈，支持 DirectX 11。它使用 DXVK 来为非 Windows 主机提供同样的支持。

支持虚拟 TPM 1.2/2.0。

改进了多显示器设置中的鼠标处理。

Vorbis 是音频录制的默认音频编解码器。


你可以查看 发行说明 以了解更多信息。

如果你正在寻找增强的功能，如更好的主题支持、加密功能、安全启动支持和类似的功能添加，VirtualBox 7.0 是一个不错的升级。

💬 你对这次升级有什么看法？你会使用较新的版本还是暂时坚持使用旧版本的虚拟机？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is the problem
Until the web app we organized ourselves either with group chats or, well, we didn’t. We ended in text message chaos, missed the messages or simply forgot about them. In the end we had 3 hair dryers but no extra gas for the gas stove. 
Sometimes we bought things and at the trip a friend notes: “Oh, I would have had that at home.”.

How we solve the problem
With a super simple app which is easy to share, simple to access and doesn’t need a new native app on the smartphone. We called our little problem solver whobrings.com

Features
- Simply share the list URL with your group
- Together add items to a list
- Assign yourself if you can bring an item
- Set the amount and description of an item
- Split the people who bring an item if the amount is bigger than 1
- Start a survey if others think the item is needed
- Live updates and list changes

Common use cases
Groups organize their next adventure or mostly camping holidays.
Teachers and parents organize school meetings.
Families organize family gatherings and events.
Small business teams organize meetings.

微软宣布了基于 OpenAI 的 DALL-E 2 模型的应用 Designer。用户可通过输入文字提示生成一系列图像。Designer 有免费版和付费版，将提供给微软 365 个人和家庭订阅用户。目前 Designer 作为一个免费的 Web 应用供公众测试和获取反馈，类似的技术将整合到 Edge 浏览器和 Bing 搜索引擎中。


消息来源：ARS Technica



老王点评：AI 图像生成已经势不可挡，虽然目前还有一些道德瑕疵，但是这总是能解决的。




GNU 工具链考虑将其基础设施转移到 Linux 基金会

GNU 工具链是 GNU/Linux 生态系统、云和嵌入式环境的基石。红帽公司资助的 SourceWare.org 多年来一直在托管 GNU 工具链的大部分基础设施，但最近有提议将其基础设施转移到 Linux 基金会提供的 IT 服务下。Linux 基金会的 IT 服务将管理 Git 存储库、邮件列表、错误跟踪器、网站、CI/CD 以及相关的基础设施。GNU 工具链的领导层已经正式表态支持这一提议。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这件事 Linux 基金会做的不错，毕竟有专门的组织来负责维护，总比红帽员工兼职维护更可靠些。毕竟，现在这种基础软件的安全一旦动摇，影响的范围已经不仅仅是个人爱好者了。




Debian GNU/Linux 14 代号已确定为“Forky”

Debian 方面今天宣布，计划 2027 年发布的 Debian 14 将被称为 “Forky”。Debian 的代号是以《玩具总动员》系列中的玩具命名的。即将在 2023 年发布的 Debian 12 代号为“Bookworm”，而 2025 年发布的 Debian 13 的代号是 “Trixie”。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你在搜索引擎中输入“ARPANET”，搜索相关图片，你会看到许多地图的图片，上面是这个上世纪六十年代末七十年代初 美国政府创建的研究网络，该网络不断延伸扩展，横跨了整个美国。我猜很多人第一次了解到 ARPANET 的时候都看过这种地图。

可以说，这些地图很有意思，毕竟我们很难想象过去连接网络的计算机是那么少，就连如此低保真的图片都可以表示出美国全部机器的所在位置（这里的低保真lo-fi指的是高射投影仪成像技术，而不是大家熟知的 lo-fi 氛围音乐）。不过，这些地图是有问题的。地图上用加粗的线条连接着大陆各地，强化了人们的一种观念：ARPANET 最大的贡献就是首次将横跨美国东西两地的电脑连接了起来。

今天，即便是在病毒肆虐、人们困居家中的情况下，网络也能把我们联系起来，可谓是我们的生命线。所以，如果认为 ARPANET 是最早的互联网，那么在那之前世界必然相互隔绝，毕竟那时还没有今天的互联网，对吧？ARPANET 首次通过计算机将人们连接起来，一定是一件惊天动地的大事。

但是，这一观点却与历史事实不符，而且它也没有进一步解释 ARPANET 的重要性。

初露锋芒

华盛顿希尔顿酒店坐落于国家广场National Mall东北方向约 2.4 千米处的一座小山丘山顶附近。酒店左右两侧白色的现代化立面分别向外延展出半个圆形，活像一只飞鸟的双翼。1965 年，酒店竣工之后，《纽约时报》报道称这座建筑物就像“一只栖息在山顶巢穴上的海鸥” [1]。

不过，这家酒店最有名的特点却深藏在地下。在车道交汇处下方，有着一个巨大的蛋形活动场地，这就是人们熟知的国际宴会厅International Ballroom，多年来一直是华盛顿特区最大的无柱宴会厅。1967 年，大门乐队在此举办了一场音乐会。1968 年，“吉他之神”吉米·亨德里克斯也在此举办了一场音乐会。到了 …]]></summary>

Rom Adams

I started my automation journey when I adopted Gentoo Linux as my primary operating system in 2002. Twenty years later, automation is not yet a done deal. When I meet with customers and partners, they share automation wins within teams, but they also describe the challenges to achieving similar success at an organizational level.
Most IT organizations have the ability to provision a virtual machine end to end, reducing what used to be a four-week lead time to just five minutes. That level of automation is itself a complex workflow, requiring networking (IP address management, DNS, proxy, networking zones, and so on), identity access management, hypervisor, storage, backup, updating the operatin…]]></summary>

多家机构在近期都发布了 AIGC 报告，这个尚在萌芽的赛道获得了巨大的关注，但在更早一些的时候，其中一些更细，更窄的领域，就已经发生了惊天动地的变化，我们将专注其中一个赛道，即 AIGC 中的「生成式文生图」领域，从技术发展，用户调研，商业模式和争议，以及对未来的一些展望，为大家呈现这份报告。
报告的数据及来源包括公开新闻媒体文章，第三方统计数据，6pen 自身数据，以及我们收回的 2398 份问卷调查和对部分行业资深人士的深度访谈。我们的问卷通过 6pen 自有渠道，即刻，微博，以及行业 KOL 分发，最终有效收到 2398 个提交，它们可能是这个行业首次的大批量对用户的直接调查，并聚焦在国内市场，我们认为其具有相当的参考性。
利益相关：本报告由 6pen 调查发布，作为行业从业者，本报告将更多从技术，用户及行业整体视角出发。
 
AI绘画技术发展的简要脉络
GAN时代
在 diffusion 被广泛运用于AI绘画之前，这种艺术形式的主要实现方式 GAN （Generative Adversarial Nets ），以NVlabs的SPADE为例：用户提供草图，由GAN模型将其转化为真实的风景图像。这听起来有点像AI绘画里的img2img，但在这类模型里，用户无法通过文本影响生成结果。

直到类似 CLIP 这种跨模态的图文模型出现，才让用户有办法用文字实现AI作画。后来者如VQGAN+CLIP 或StyleCLIP，均是因为CLIP打通文本和图形域(domain)，用户输入的文本与GAN生成的结果真正有了「可比较性」，这使得计算二者误差并迭代效果成为了可能。

GAN在模拟分布方面有着天然的优势，因此它在人脸属性编辑、风格模仿等领域大放异彩，例如给人戴上墨镜、加上胡子、生成动漫脸、模仿小说风格。也正因如此，它也很容易陷入模型坍缩(Model Collapse)，即…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们大部分人总会身处在一种「身不由己」的状态里，然后内心有一些向往的生活状态，但是现实很残酷，导致自己现在无法去达到目标，于是陷入到了焦虑和无奈的情绪中。
在国庆的节假日里，我见了一个很久未见的朋友。他的孩子已经两岁了，在聊天时，我能感觉到他因为有了孩子后，产生了很大的压力和焦虑。他说，因为有了孩子以后，以往的时间都不由自己来做主了，然后未来所有的计划都变了，已经买好的不错的房子，会因为学区房做改变的计划，然后自己也舍不得消费，想把挣到的钱给孩子准备上。他是一个很负责的人，也希望能多陪孩子，努力工作把孩子养大。但是他觉得自己牺牲了自己看电影、健身，以及和爱人出门旅游的机会，如果要恢复这些，要等孩子长到18岁的成年以后，也就是说，还要等16年。说到这里，他的眼神里露出了一丝无奈。
听到这里，我总觉得哪里不太对，于是产生了一些疑问，面临这样的不由己状态，我们只能无奈或者焦虑？我希望通过这篇文章，呈现出我对这个问题的完整思考，希望你看完后，能够从新的视角去看待自己的问题。
我们不妨先问一个问题：我们为什么讨厌「不由己」的感觉？
答案是：每个人的内心都在追寻某种「自由」。人为什么要追寻自由？其实不仅是人，只要是生物，就会追求自由，追求一种随性地、自然地、丰富地生长。任何人都不希望自己的眼睛永远只盯着一个地方，耳朵只能听见一成不变的音色和音调；不希望身体被禁锢在一个狭小幽闭的空间里不能动弹，不希望思想停止运行，因为当思考停止，就意味着自己不再存在。
自由是人的天性，也可以说，自由是我们不得不接受的权利。
说了那么多自由的不可或缺，那什么才算自由？
一、什么才算自由？
提到自由，我最先想到的是时间和地点的自由。比如做一个旅行 up 主，可以随时出去旅游，想去哪儿就去哪儿，这叫自由。而每天在格子间上班，按照准确的时间上下班打卡，一天里重要的时间都交付给公司和老板，这叫不自由。

Source code must be compiled in order to run, and in open source software everyone has access to source code. Whether you've written code yourself and you want to compile and run it, or whether you've downloaded somebody's project to try it out, it's useful to know how to process source code through a compiler, and also what exactly a compiler does with all that code.

Asynchronous programming: Incredibly useful but difficult to learn. You can't avoid async programming to create a fast and reactive application. Applications with a high amount of file or network I/O or with a GUI that should always be reactive benefit tremendously from async programming. Tasks can be executed in the background while the user still makes inputs. Async programming is possible in many languages, each with different styles and syntax. Rust is no exception. In Rust, this feature is called async-await.
While async-await has been an integral part of Rust since version 1.39.0, most applications depend on community crates. In Rust, except for a larger binary, async-await comes with zero costs.…]]></summary>

文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

一、问题描述
前段时间碰到一个问题，我 iPhone 背板碎了，需要走 AppleCare 交给苹果返厂维修，而我的 iPhone 是 512GB 的，在备份数据时候麻烦了，我笔记本本身就是 512GB 空间的，肯定不够用呀。
而备份 iPhone 默认的存储位置是在本机的硬盘上，我有个 14T 的硬盘，那么如何将默认的备份位置改到外部存储设备上呢。

二、如何设置备份位置到外部存储器
默认的备份位置在下面这个目录
~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup
其目录是这样的，Backup 里面就是你的每个设备每次的备份记录

我们要做的就是将这个位置映射到你的移动硬盘上去。
1. 确定你的移动硬盘位置
你需要知道自己硬盘的完整文件路径：

打开终端，
输入 cd 然后将你的硬盘图标拖到终端中，就会看到它的路径了
回车进入到移动硬盘目录下，指令 ls -al 能看到硬盘中的所有文件（图片中的 ll 是我自定义的一个指令）
我的就是 /Volumes/Kyle 14TB/ （在终端的路径需要转义空格，所以能看到终端中名字空格前面有个 \）

2. 移动硬盘中新建一个备份文件夹
在你的移动硬盘中新建一个备份文件夹，用于存储接下来的手机备份文件。
mkdir Backup
此时能看到目录中多出一个名为 Backup 的文件夹
 

进入这个文件夹并展示它的绝对路径
cd Backup
pwd
能看到我的这个文件夹的绝对路径是 /Volumes/Kyle 14TB/Backup，这个会在下…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[现今社会高速发展，充满了不确定性。我们置身于时代的洪流中，被裹挟着不知冲向何处。诚然，时代给了我们更多的选择，同时也让我们更加迷茫，仿佛处在一个有无数岔路的迷宫里，不知道自己将走向何方。
「如何在不确定的风浪里，实现确定性的成长？」这应该是现今大多人所关注的问题吧。
关于成长，市面上有很多方法论，但它往往都不讲背后的原理。不知道大家是否也和我一样，看到一些方法或者教程，经常会收藏起来，跟练一段时间，但大多都是半途而废，坚持一阵子后又打回原形了。
为什么会这样呢？因为每个人的情况不同，适用的方法也不同。如果只是知其然不知其所以然，那只有不断地尝试各种方法，不断地去磨合，才能找到适合自身的。这个尝试的过程，其实就是通过外界的方法，来获得自身的反馈，从而更了解自己。
但如果我们换个角度，一开始就从了解自己出发，再剖析方法背后的原理，那是不是更容易找到适合自己的方法呢？所以我认为，知其然又知其所以然，反倒是一条捷径。
要了解自己，就得先知道我们的心智是怎么运作的。所谓「心智」，就像是大脑里一个可以不断升级的系统，包含了我们对外部世界的所有认知，也包括因此所造就的思维方式。我们的认知和感觉，其实也只是心智对外部世界的投射而已。
前不久出版的一本新书——《打开心智》，正是围绕「心智」这个概念展开的。兵书有云，「知己知彼，百战不殆」。书中先是阐述了大脑的四个基本原理，帮助我们了解心智是怎么运作的，此为「知己」；然后又围绕情绪、习惯、动力、学习、思考和创造等方面，剖析背后的原理，此为「知彼」。不仅如此，它还提供一套行之有效的方法，让我们能更好地实现自己的目标。所以，这是一本帮助我们认识自我、突破自我的书籍，知己知彼，我们才能更有效实现自我成长，去应对时代的不确定性。
书籍作者是李睿秋（Lachel），一名深度思考践行者，常年专注于心理学、认知科学与心智研究，同时也是虎嗅年度十大作者、36氪…]]></summary>

Maximilian Kolb
Wed, 10/12/2022 - 03:00

            
When you manage your IT infrastructure using Foreman and Katello, the smallest unit to operate on is generally a host. You can provision hosts, deliver versioned content, and set configurations. Using Foreman ACD, you can use your Foreman instance to deploy applications consisting of multiple services spanning multiple hosts. This blog post briefly introduces the Foreman ACD plugin and explains how it can help you deploy a Prometheus and Grafana stack. If you want to know more about deploying an ELK stack consisting of an Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana, look at Deploying an ELK Cluster with Application Centric Deployment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
本教程源于 @yetone 的一篇 推文 ，和 @Jack Huang 讨论后稍作修改。
苹果自带的翻译功能在几次版本更新之后已很好用，但需要多个步骤，对专业词汇的支持也没有欧陆词典好（欧陆词典可自行扩充词库）。本教程基于 iOS 自带的 Back Tap 功能，快速启动翻译软件，并支持截图 OCR 翻译。
前期准备
下载软件： 欧路词典 (Eudic) 和快捷指令 (Shortcuts)
「欧路词典」，是一款经典的翻译软件，可自行扩充词库，专业版需付费。
「快捷指令」是苹果官方的软件，前身是 Workflow Gallery，可以理解成一个无代码开发平台（No-Code Development Platform），不需要编程知识，就能完成很多自动化功能的实现。如果对这方面感兴趣，可访问 Shortcuts Gallery 。
安装 Shortcuts
在 Safari 中打开以下两个链接，点击「获取捷径」，再点击「添加快捷方式」。
Clipboard Translate: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b643ecb89dbd4468b8679cd4888b13d9
Image Translate: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/02bf2bb484a54f50897b8a3f315d48fd
设置快捷方式
点击「设置」- 辅助功能 – 触控 – 轻点背面（Back Tap）- 设置如图所示：

使用
Clipboard Translate：轻点手机背面两次，自动读取「剪切板」中的文本，并跳转欧路词典翻译。
Image Translate: 轻点手机背面三次，自动截屏，并识别图片中的文本，跳转欧路词典翻译。
扩展：

上文是通过 Back Tap 实现的，日常使用中偶尔会有误触的可能，也可以通过「辅助触控」，俗称「小白点」实现。
macOS 上的全文翻译可参考这篇文章：一种几乎永不失效的网页中英对照翻译方案]]></summary>

Tech is everywhere! And it's important to remember, everyone is a beginner once. The industry is continually growing, looking for new folks to add valuable perspectives. How do we inspire our next batch of tech contributors?
In honor of Ada Lovelace Day, we asked our community of writers if they had any resources or books they recommend for young programmers or enthusiasts. Here's what they had to share.
Start from Scratch
I recommend Coding Games in Scratch: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide to Building Your Own Computer Games by Jon Woodcock and Code Your Own Games!: 20 Games to Create with Scratch by Max Wainewright. Being a LEGO family, all of my kids have spent time with …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当我第一次接触「断舍离」这个概念的时候，不仅对它描绘的图景所震撼，而且深切认为这就是我想要的生活。于是我在家里翻箱倒柜的搜索可以丢弃物品，从没用的数据线到大件的废纸箱，只要是能扔的我都直接从家中扔了出去。
也许是一次性丢弃的东西过多，还没等到我开始审视剩下的东西要不要留下，家中有些东西就已经告急了，无奈又开始了买买买的旅程。当我检查购物订单，发现其中含有已经丢弃的物品，我才意识到出现了问题。例如有一次，我需要同时充电多个设备，需要多根数据线，但为了实现「断舍离」，只保留了一根。那时我发现，很多我所丢弃的东西不是不需要的，而是在扔东西那一刻我认为不需要。
仔细想想，这种丢完东西后，又重新买的行为不正是商家所乐意看到的吗？把这种观念作为生活的准则似乎是从另一个方面掉入了消费主义的陷阱。为此我重新审视、省察了「断舍离」这个概念和我所想象的生活，并重新制定了一套可行、节俭的规则。
谨慎购买物品
谨慎购买物品应该是我认为最能体现「断舍离」后生活的方法了。毕竟，我希望看到的是一个没有过多杂物和没用物品的家。既然我无法将所有东西都丢弃，那么就控制新增物品的数量。先对已有物品尽可能收纳，让空间看起来不那么杂乱，再对每个想买的东西进行衡量，如果不是必须的，那就对它说不。
当然，谨慎购买物品也要购买物品。例如：平时生活需要用的牙膏、毛巾等必需品直接买就可以了，买时尽可能货比三家，选择合适的价格和种类。真正应该谨慎购买的是那些看起来有大用，但实际到手可能不会使用的东西。
这里可以分享几个我自己的衡量方法作为参考：
谨慎购买「美好生活」
例如，当我在网上看到了一个洗碗机的广告，它不断的宣传购买洗碗机后解放双手的美好。如果按照宣传所描述的，我是可以购买后有更多的时间去干其他的事情。然而，我回顾日常生活后发现我平时并没有洗大量碗的需求，也就是说，在没看到这个广告前我是不会想象到它所描绘的「美好生活」，…]]></summary>

Chris Hermansen
Tue, 10/11/2022 - 03:00

            
Lately, I've been looking at how Groovy streamlines the slight clunkiness of Java. This article examines some differences between connecting to a PostgreSQL database using JDBC in Java versus Groovy.
Install Java and Groovy
Groovy is based on Java and requires a Java installation. Both a recent/decent version of Java and Groovy might be in your Linux distribution's repositories, or you can install Groovy by following these instructions. A nice alternative for Linux users is SDKMan, which provides multiple versions of Java, Groovy, and many other related tools. For this article, I'm using SDK's releases of:
Java version 11.0.12-open of OpenJDK 11
Groovy version 3.0.8

设想这样一个情况吧：
你带着愉快的心情到了一个地方度假，结果在度假期间遭遇新毒株的新冠疫情爆发，全城宣布静默，城市道路、公共交通和出港港口全部封闭或停运。在配合社区每天的核酸检测和居家不出门同时，你也在仔细留意当地发布的相关信息 —— 十分幸运的是，尽管此刻的疫情还很严重，但当地已经宣布恢复机场运行，你似乎看到了一丝曙光，决定购买机票离开。
然而，事情似乎并没有你想象的这么简单。从恢复机场的商业化运行之后，到你真正坐上飞机离开这里的时间，却过去了一个月。那么这一个月里，到底发生了什么？
偶遇三亚疫情，与「幽灵航班」斗智斗勇
我和朋友在今年的 7 月 16 日回到三亚，开始为期一个月的旅居生活。然而半个月后，一起从崖州区爆发的境外输入疫情在短短几天内就席卷了整个三亚，然后迅速波及了整个海南岛内。受到疫情的影响，我和朋友只能决定提前结束旅居，在 8 月 5 日的晚上购买了 8 月 9 日从海口回广州的火车票，并决定在 8 月 6 日一早坐环岛高铁前往海口。
但计划总是赶不上变化。就在 8 月 6 日的凌晨 3 点 52 分，三亚发布发出通知，宣布全域进入静默状态。

自 2022 年 8 月 6 日凌晨 6 时起，全市实行临时性全域静态管理，除保障社会基本运行服务、疫情防控和紧急特殊情况外，全市范围限制人员流动，暂停城市公共交通。恢复时间另行通告。
原本 7 月最后一个周末还因为办音乐节而人流爆满的三亚后海主街，短短一周就变得萧条异常
好在 8 月 15 日之后，三亚宣布有序恢复凤凰国际机场国内客运航班商业化运行。这意味着，只要是符合…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[平时工作中往往会遇到新的知识点，这个时候需要我们快速学习并且进行最佳实践。往往是在真正学习了一段时间之后，才会发现有哪些地方可以优化，这样磨合出来的工作流才是最适合自己的。经过两年工作之余的学习后，我磨合出了以下学习工作流：

底层核心逻辑
一开始我学习新知识时会参考一些博客或者是视频，当我开始敲代码实践时往往会出现一些纰漏和错误，我开始意识到我参考的信息可能是错误的，毕竟发博客的门槛低，因此文章的可信度可能不高，于是我开始查阅一些相关的中文书籍。
中文书籍的确是比较全面且系统地讲解了知识点，但众所周知，技术更迭很迅速，又因为老美在 CS 方面一直都是灯塔，所以一般中文书籍里的内容会滞后于当前最新的知识，导致我跟着中文书籍实践会出现软件版本差异的问题。这时我开始意识到一手信息的重要性，有些中文书籍是翻译英文书籍的，一般翻译一本书也要一两年，这会导致信息传递的延迟，还有就是翻译的过程中信息会有损失。如果一本中文书籍不是翻译的呢，那么它肯定也是参考其他书籍的，参考的过程会带有对英文原著中语言和语义理解的偏差。
于是我就顺其自然地开始翻阅英文书籍。不得不说，整体英文书籍内容的质量是比中文书籍高的，一个原因是写英文书籍的作者更会写作，他们会用自己的话很详尽地解释一个知识点，而不是像一些中文书籍那样罗列知识点并且理所当然地以为读者能读懂而忽略一些细节的描述，还有一个原因就是知识很注重时效性，英文书籍的内容往往更新一点。后来随着学习的层层深入，以知识的时效性和完整性出发，我发现 源代码 > 官方文档 > 英文书籍 > 英文博客，最后我得出了一张 信息损失图

虽然一手信息很重要，但后面的 N 手信息并非一无是处，往往这 N 手资料里写了作者对源知识的转化——作者对知识基于某种逻辑的梳理（流程图、思维导图等）以及自己的一些理解（对源知识的抽象、类比、延伸到其他知识点），这些转化可以帮助我…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果说苹果发布会是每年一度的春晚，微信的间歇性更新就像不期而至的假期。在过去的十一年间，微信逐步从最初的简单样子一步步变迁为现在承载了许多功能和期待的国民软件。
而我作为一个非极客普通用户，在翻看朋友圈时蓦然发现这款软件自己也已经不知不觉得用了九年，发布了无数朋友圈内容和加入了许许多多的群聊。自己也从一个微信聊天使用者变成了公众号重度用户和创作者。不妨总结下过去这些年我是如何一步步从抗拒到全面使用微信的以及它带给了我日常生活哪些改变。
面朝屏幕的对话
毫无疑问，所有微信用户使用频率最高的一定是微信的基本功能：聊天。一对一或一对多，文字或语音。每个人都习惯了面对着屏幕表达自己。
加个微信
随着微信的普及，几乎没有朋友没有微信，以至于“加个微信”变成一个礼貌性和建立连接的标准动作。
我一开始并不理解为何微信会拿下偌大的市场，但过年回到老家后看到那么多中老年非QQ用户拿着微信发语音消息时，我才意识到它极大得拓宽了用户群体：“按住说话，松开发送” 简洁而易用。即便是我自己并不喜欢对面突如其来的数个60秒语音（希望微信语音能像子弹短信那样实现可以自动转为文字或者暂停播放的语音管理），但毕竟使用门槛大大降低了，而且简洁爽气的操作界面远远超过了当时花里胡哨的QQ。
所以几乎国内智能手机用户人均一个微信号时，加个微信，犹如一个登门入户的邀请，使得物理分离开之后，依旧保持了进一步交流的可能性，既有的情感更容易维系或加深。
当我们都拥有了一个便宜而高清的通讯渠道时，高昂的运营商资费带来的束缚瞬间被打破，许多亲人和朋友的联系变得频繁。当某个中秋和朋友们打着微信视频“云喝酒”，一起庆祝花好月圆夜时突然觉得科技的进步真好。如果哪一天能够启用Callkit（即像接听电话一样接听），微信电话或视频的体验应该会更好。
遇见陌生人
刚刚开始使用微信时的的朋友大多是熟人，群聊大多是家庭群，工作群，同学群。之后…]]></summary>

什么是NAS

NAS (Network Attached Storage：网络附属存储) 是一种连接您家中或办公室网路的智慧储存装置。您可以将家人或同事的重要文件、珍贵的相片、影音收藏等档案储存于 NAS，仅需透过网页浏览器或手机应用程式，即可轻松存取档案并享有 NAS 提供的丰富服务。

NAS 也可以简单理解为：「不限速的个性化本地网盘」。
不知道你在日常生活中是否遇到过以下的情形：

电脑的储存空间不够用，想要使用文件，但不想把所有文件存在本地；
存在百度云盘的文件或视频，下载速度仅有 69KB/s；
急需从 OneDrive 下载一个文件，却发现 OneDrive 无法打开；
迅雷下载影片，进度超过 98% 之后下载速度只有 5KB/s；
无处安放的照片存在云相册，画质受到不可逆损伤；
MAC 内建备份功能「时间机器」无处备份个人数据；
无法忍受互联网大厂的隐私乱象；
团队协作交互讨论、修改、审批效率太低，大文件传输困难；

如果你在生活中遇到过以上痛点，这篇文章或许会给你提供一个解决思路。
如何选购 NAS
目前的 NAS 市场基本被群晖和威联通垄断，即便是采用 DIY 方案，也还是要使用黑群晖或黑威联通的系统（即破解版系统）。本文以本土化更好些的群晖NAS（Synology NAS）为例，介绍如何选购家用 NAS。

「盘位」代表可以安装的硬盘数量，部分型号可以通过购买扩充装置的方法进行盘位扩展。
「双核和四核」表示可以同时运行的程序数量。
「2GB内存」代表程序运行的速度，部分型号可以进行扩展。但要注意，部分…]]></summary>

我是特斯拉 Model 3 的用户，个人觉得特斯拉在大陆的导航和娱乐系统确实不太好用，当然可能也和我日常喜欢用高德导航、Spotify 听歌这些比较多有关系。相信很多特斯拉的用户也和我一样，非常希望能用上苹果的 CarPlay，但特斯拉的车机系统其实是 Linux 并且非常封闭，目前也不太存在破解和安装软件这种捷径的可能。
特斯拉 CarPlay
不过波兰的开发者 Michał Gapiński 前段时间给出了一个用树莓派的解决方法，实现了在特斯拉上使用 CarPlay。因为之前一直需要的两块树莓派的开发板，直到最近简化到了一个并且也简单稳定了不少，我也就做个教程和大家分享下。
准备工作
需要说一下，树莓派 4B 目前的价格依然比较高，整个过程也稍微有点麻烦，折腾的乐趣大于实际使用的意义，不太建议特意为这个去买树莓派，也不太建议不熟悉刷机的朋友尝试。
为了实现在特斯拉上使用 CarPlay 的效果，你需要准备：

树莓派 4B 开发板（需包含 SD 卡和读卡器）
HDMI 转 CSI-2 转接板
Micro HDMI to HDMI 连接线
车连易的 CarPlay 盒子
USB Type-C 数据线（用于刷机以及连接车供电）
一台电脑（用于给树莓派安装系统 Win Mac 都可以）
下载好系统 （版本：2022.38.1)

当然有些是可选的：比如树莓派的外壳和散热风扇，推荐选择塑料的外壳，因为金属的可能会屏蔽树莓派的 Wi-Fi 信号；如果想让特斯拉连接到树莓派的 Wi-Fi 的时候还能使用网络，则需要再购买一个 USB 4G…]]></summary>

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become more prevalent in our daily lives. While AI systems may intend to offer users convenience, there have been numerous examples of automated tools getting it wrong, resulting in serious consequences. What's happening in the AI system that leads to erroneous and harmful conclusions? Probably a dramatic combo of bad AI combined with a lack of human oversight. How do we as a society prevent AI ethics fails?
The open source community has had, for well over 20 years, clear processes for dealing with errors ("bugs") in software. The Open Source Definition firmly establishes the rights of developers and the rights of users. There are frameworks, licenses, and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我的第一部手机是在去外地上初中时，从我妈那里淘汰下来的诺基亚 3100，之后是高中时用的诺基亚 5320XM。读中学时移动互联网才初露头角，5320XM 用 100 MB 流量的 EDGE 网套餐承载了我躲在宿舍床上的摸鱼时光，按键的漆也在一条条聊天短信里被磨掉。当时我的所有朋友都在用全拼打字，而我为了提高速度，把手指挪动更少的笔划输入法练得飞快。

后来我换了 Android 机器，在还有不少想去把玩的手机没试过时，迎来了 Symbian 与诺基亚的衰落，送走了滑盖、旋盖、全键盘。移动互联网改变了我们使用手机的习惯，也同样改变手机的形态——所以当我发现还有厂商在出实体数字键盘的智能机时，就一直想找个机会试试。赶上多亲 F22 Pro 新品发布，我付了款，等过了两周的疫情，终于把它拿到了手。
这份喜悦在到手的一小时内烟消云散。

青涩但合格的硬件设计
多亲 F22 Pro 的设计和前代的 F21 Pro 其实有很多不同。
除了处理器从 MT6761 / 虎贲 T310 一下跃升到 MTK G85 以外（虽然还是挺弱的），比较显眼的就是尺寸变化。屏幕从此前的 2.8 英寸 480*640 升级到了 3.5 英寸 640*960，这样的参数现在看来可能并不出色，但它和 iPhone 4 的那块 Retina 细腻程度其实一致，文字显示效果不错。而且由于用了几天只有三英寸的 Jelly 2，这块屏幕甚至让我有种换上大屏手机的错觉。

机身和之前的多亲手机一致，依然是与功能机一样的瘦长手感，再加上与 iPhone 4 一样的屏幕和圆形的导航键，整个手机颇有一种当年 iPhone 配上 Typo 键盘壳的感觉。手机的宽度也因为屏幕增大从 53 mm 扩展到 58 mm，和现在流行的尺寸相比，仍然很容易上手。
按键方面，F22 Pro 抛弃了上代采用的孤岛式按键，转向了一体式的按键设计…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我在硅谷科技大厂工作，自20年初疫情爆发至今居家办公已有2年半。在此期间，为应对远程办公而打造的软件、平台、工具雨后春笋般涌现而发展壮大，工作中的沟通协同方式乃至绩效考核机制也随之发生了深刻的改变。相信如此大规模且持续的远程办公潮流在人类工业发展史上都是头一次，而这种趋势还将继续延续下去。
这股远程办公的潮流和趋势，对于身处其间的打工仔而言又有怎样的影响呢？首先要强调的是，远程办公也许并不适用于所有行业(至少在现阶段)，居家远程办公也未必适合所有人。
以我个人的经历而言，我的小孩在此期间出生现都已2岁有余，除此之外我还经历了买房升职。似乎远程办公的工作形式并没有对我的人生重要节点造成什么特别的影响。然而回过头来看又不能不承认，我的生活作息、社交活动与工作方式都已发生积极正面的改变。
居家办公始末
20年初，随着疫情的爆发和公司对于员工健康的关注，硅谷的科技公司陆续允许员工在家远程办公。除去极少数公司在初期就允诺疫情结束之后员工可以继续远程工作，绝大多数的公司还是给出了一个返回办公室的预定时间目标。不过由于漂亮国防疫政策的拉垮，这个预定时间不断地被推迟。直到疫苗的大规模铺开，最终在今年的5月前后，各大公司开始号召员工返回办公室。
2年多的远程办公已经深刻地改变了人们的生活方式：有人已经离开房价高企的硅谷或大都市搬迁到物价更低的偏远地区，有人因为家中有高危人群（老人或小孩）而不愿意回到办公司暴露在潜在的感染风险之中，有人单纯习惯了不用上下班通勤的生活而不再愿意花费时间去办公室。把四散各地的员工“驱赶”回办公室并非可一蹴而就。有感于此，大多数“开明”的公司都发布了混合办公的政策，即一周可以有若干个工作日在家办公（其余工作日仍然需要回到办公室）；又或者开放了永久远程办公的申请，为铁了心不回办公室的员工打开一个通道。某种程度而言，全员远程办公这件事情，已经在今年夏天结束。

最近需要给长辈置换一下手机，在有限的预算内，经过多次比较发现还是小米的硬件配置更好一些，最后也是下单了小米。
在 2022 年，Android 系统对手机权限的进一步限制，一些过往的卡顿问题都得到了一定的解决。但是在国内的定制版 Android 机上，和原生 Android 系统还是多了一些特色的东西：

无处不在的系统级广告，诱导用户点击/误触，从而去跳转/下载 APP
“不小心下载” 的 APP，占用宝贵的内存/硬盘资源，拖慢手机速度
国内特色的航母级 APP，一个 APP 占几个 G 的硬盘，有些小而美的应用甚至几十个 G

上面的三个问题中，前两个可以通过一定的努力解决大部分，第三个大家都没得选只能硬抗。本文就是聚焦于「关闭 MIUI 无处不在的广告」这个话题的。

虽然 MIUI 一直有 ADUI 的称呼，但是个人身处这个行业也能表示理解：
小米把硬件上的利润压到了最低，赚不到钱就要从其他路子上想办法，只能不停的“加点儿广告怎么了”

废话不多说，我们直接开始。

本文成文于 2022.09，使用的是 MIUI 13.0.4 版本，随着时间的推移，其它版本 MIUI 可能有操作不一致的情况，这点需要读者注意。

一、通过常规手段关闭广告推送
1.1 关闭系统广告
MIUI 的许多内置应用（例如 天气、万年历、音乐）和系统级页面（例如桌面文件夹）上都会推送一些贴片广告，诱导用户观看和点击。
可能用户反馈过于激烈，2019 年年末某个版本更新中，新增了「一键关闭系统广告」的功能。这个开关也很好找，我们直接进入「设置」，然后在搜索框里输入「系统广告」，然后点击进入新页面，把「系统工具广告」这个开关关上即可。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[相信对于很多小伙伴来说，Twitter并非单纯是一个“社交”平台，而是“信息获取”平台。通过追踪各类名人、机构的账号来了解所关注领域的最新动向。比如最近火热的NFT、Web3.0社区中就有大量的意见领袖在Twitter发声。
然而从获取信息效率的视角来看，常规Twitter浏览界面并不是特别友好，时间线上有着各类广告，同时经常用着用着就发现自己迷失在几十个选项卡和搜索结果页中。如果你遇到过类似问题，并希望提高在Twitter获取信息的效率，我会强烈推荐Tweetdeck这个功能。
Tweetdeck是Twitter官方提供的在线工具，有模块化，高度自定义化的浏览界面，不仅适合专业的Twitter运营人员工作使用，也非常适合个人用户来改造优化自己的信息时间线。通过对比图片，可以很清楚的看到两种模式的差异。Tweetdeck可以在设置中选择 黑/白 两种显示模式，我个人更喜欢黑暗模式，看起来更轻松。
4K显示器下的twitter常规界面，大量留白非常浪费空间4K显示器下的tweetdeck界面
 
基础介绍
Tweetdeck和常规界面相比最重要的功能主要是3点：自动刷新、多列显示和自定义模块。自动刷新不需要过多解释，节省频繁刷新的操作和时间。自定义模块可以定制每一列种显示的内容，例如：

我想单独查看Elon Musk的所有推特或者他直发的内容。 - 单用户模式
我希望把多个账号归为一个主题，单独浏览，如：NBA球星们、实时股市新闻、NFT相关资讯。 - 清单模式
我想追踪网友对正在发生的热点事件的评论，如：WWDC大会、俄乌冲突事件等 - 搜索模式

多列显示则大幅度提升了屏幕利用率，让我们可以同时间追踪上述这些不同的主题。

上图是我最近使用Tweetdeck的截图，我通过Vivaldi浏览器“垂直平铺”功能在右边放置了Tesla AI Day的视频直播，在左边放置了Tweetdeck，并添加了：“tesla ai day”搜索结果列、“tesla bot”搜索结果列、Elon的个人内容列，和常用的市场资讯列。
 
模块选择
在Tweetdeck中，可以选择添加多种不同的模块，其中包含，
内容类模块：单用户模式、搜索模式、清单模式、正在流行内容等
功能类模块：通知、站内信、@我的、已预约内容等
我并没有做账户运营的需求，因此最常使用的还是：搜索结果、单个用户、多用户清单这几个内容类模块。
可添加模块截图
 
搜索模式：
显示关键词搜索结果配合自动刷新功能，达成“直播”的效果。并且可以通过设置条件对搜索结果进一步筛选，可设置条件包含：

按推文类型过滤：例如包含图片、视频、GIF等的推文；或者是否显示“转发”内容。
筛选内容的发布时间范围，最小单位可以精确到半个小时。
按照推文语言类型筛选，例如：中文、英文、日语等。
筛选推文发布者：选择特定的单个用户或者一组用户的搜索结果。
内容互动情况：显示至少有多少点赞、转发或评论的内容。

 
单用户模式 & 多用户清单：
这2个模式本质差别就是关注用户的多少，选定关注范围后的筛选条件选项完全一致。在这2个模块中，同样可以通过设置筛选条件，包含：

按推文类型过滤：例如包含图片、视频、GIF等的推文；或者是否显示“转发”内容。
关键词过滤：显示或排除包含指定关键词的内容。
用户筛选：由指定用户发布的内容 或 @特定用户的内容。

在Tweetdeck追踪的，不管是单用户还是清单，并不要求是关注的账户。这点非常贴心，也帮助我区分不同使用场景，我把大量“新闻资讯”类账号从关注列表中去除，放在Tweetdeck清单中，日常在手机上浏览就不会被刷屏，而更关注轻松的内容，坐在电脑前则可以追踪查看这些庞杂的资讯。
在Tweetdeck创建的清单可以选择设置为公开或者私有列表，同时这个列表也会同步到常规界面左侧的列表按钮中。

 
模块设置：
这几个内容模块中都可以单独设置“媒体展示尺寸大小”，可以大体理解为模块中每一条内容的高度。以及是否通过“声音”或者“桌面通知”的形式发送通知，提示关注的内容有更新。

Tweetdeck是简单，但又很强大的工具，给我带来了很多的便利，也希望分享给大家，打造适合自己的内容模块。
 
PS：
Tweetdeck访问地址：https://tweetdeck.twitter.com
今年Twitter官方下架了Tweetdeck的桌面客户端软件，仅提供网页版本，如果想在电脑上安装独立客户端可以使用Tweeten，有Windows和Mac版本，并且基于Tweetdeck提供了更多的功能。

在不久之前，我写了一篇文章，大概讲了一下我认为出国留学「摄影」这件事对我而言的几个较有价值的部分，其中有一点是获得了「从学术的角度出发理解摄影」的一个方法。今天我就打算展开讲讲我从英国这个摄影的「发源地」学到的方法论之——如何理解摄影，希望和大家一同探讨。
需要提醒的是，这篇文章里有一些学术概念，我已经用了尽量简单易懂的方式表述，但出于对「信息传递更精准」的目的，我依然保留了一些可能不好理解的名词，建议大家收藏本文，慢慢看。
首先，我想先对「理解摄影」这个话题加上一个更具体的语境，即——如何用一种具有创造性的方式理解摄影，而这也是我们上个学年在讨论的一个核心议题：「The central question will be how to read photographic images in an innovative manner. 」。
正如上面提到的，「用创造性的方式解读摄影」，这个表述背后事实上是默认了在「创造性 」的解读照片的方式背后还有一种「非创造性」的方式解读照片。那么所谓的「非创造性」和「创造性」指的是什么呢？让我们先从「非创造性」开始说起。
「非创造性」——摄影的本质
首先，要从沃克·埃文斯（Walker Evans）在 1931 年写的一篇名为《摄影的重生》（The Reappearance of Photography）的文章说起。这篇文章里提到了尤金·阿杰特（Eugene Atget）、史泰钦（Edward Steichen）、阿尔伯特·伦格-帕茨（Renger Patzsch）等多位摄影师的作品，并对他们有…]]></summary>

Open Jam game jam is happening from October 28 to November 9 this year. Every year for the past several years, programmers from around the globe build open source video games, and then play and rate one another's games. Just for fun.
Open Jam is a "game jam," which is a casual way to inspire programmers of all skill levels to focus on a just-for-fun project for a concentrated period of time. It promotes open source games as well as open source game creation tools. While participants aren't required to use open source tools to create their game, the games themselves must bear an open license, and you literally get extra points during the scoring round for using open source tools.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol based on SSLv3 designed to encrypt and decrypt traffic between two sites. In other words, TLS ensures that you're visiting the site you meant to visit and prevents anyone between you and the website from seeing the data being passed back and forth. This is achieved through the mutual exchange of digital certificates: a private one that exists on the web server, and a public one typically distributed with web browsers.
In production environments, all servers run securely, but server certificates may expire after some period. It is then the server's responsibility to validate, regenerate, and reuse newly genera…]]></summary>

@甜食：神藤毛巾内毛圈浴巾

入手渠道：淘宝
入手价格：370 元

最近因为搬家，许多生活用品需要重新购买，其中自然也包括各类卫浴洗漱用品这种又占空间、单价又便宜，导致搬走不如买新的的物件。在物色新浴巾的时候，我发现了神藤毛巾这个品牌。神藤毛巾是日本大阪的毛巾品牌，有别于传统的毛圈表面的毛巾，他们的产品以棉纱材质的毛巾见长。
传统毛巾的毛圈材质表面积更大，用来清洁自然是效率更高的，不过生活在南方的读者应该多少都会有潮湿天气下毛巾连日难以风干，甚至产生异味的经验，神藤的毛巾采用了多层纱布的织法，既保证了良好的吸水性，疏松的质地也让毛巾更加速干，同时比较平滑的表面也提供了更清爽的触感。
我最终购买的这款产品叫作 Inner Pile，算是神藤毛巾比较创新的一款产品（和很多刻板印象中的日本作坊式品牌一样，他们总共只有三款产品 —— 另外两款是多层棉纱毛巾「2.5-PLY GAUZE」和传统的毛圈毛巾「YUKINE」，具体用途只通过尺寸来区分），由外层的两层纱布夹着中间的一层毛圈构成。由于中间的毛圈层，这款毛巾的吸水性比纯纱布的毛巾更胜一筹，整体也更蓬松，摸起来甚至有点冬天棉衣的蓬松感，但又非常轻。外层的纱布又保证了清爽的触感，格外适合作为浴巾使用。
毛巾的近距离状态，可以看到多层疏松透光的结构毛巾的标签，我到手之后直接把标签拆了，没有拍到新品缝在毛巾上的样子
我这些年的一个经验是，从所谓改善生活质量的角度出发，买更多更好更贵的大件（如电子产品）带来的幸福感往往远不如买一些高品质的小件生活用品。…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[本文首发于CITYLAB公众号]
今年，赛博朋克的风又刮了起来。一部《赛博朋克：边缘行者》的热播动画，不仅让游戏《赛博朋克2077》的玩家数量暴涨近400%，也让赛博朋克风再度成为亚文化讨论焦点。而说起赛博朋克美学，则绕不开一座城——香港。
香港街头琳琅满目的霓虹灯招牌，曾是赛博朋克视觉想象的灵感之源，但时至今日，这些霓虹魅影正在被拆除、消亡、遗忘。
01.赛博朋克的视觉语言
「Cyberpunk」一词源自1983年美国作家Bruce Bethke创作的短篇小说，是「Cybernetics」与「Punk」的结合词。「Cybernetics」是一种「关于在动物和机器中控制和通信」的科学研究，又称模控学，「Punk」则是由1960年代摇滚乐流派延伸出来的词，指涉那些对主流社会充满反叛精神的边缘人群。
《赛博朋克：边缘行者》中的主角出身贫民阶层
赛博朋克作品一般设定在科技高度发达的近未来，模控化的义体人或仿生人被大量应用，同时，这样的社会又往往被极权政府、跨国财团或秘密组织所掌控，导致贫富差距严重，恶劣的生存环境刺激底层punk们进行反叛。因此，高科技、低生活的反乌托邦景象成为赛博朋克作品的鲜明特征。
而赛博朋克的视觉化构建，是早于这个词诞生的。
1982年的电影《银翼杀手》，可以说是奠定了赛博朋克视觉美学的基础。片中总是雨水潮湿的街道、鱼龙混杂的路边摊、荧光闪烁的立面装饰、英文与亚洲文字混杂的霓虹灯招牌……成为众多观众心目中对于赛博朋克的经典印象，导演雷德利·斯科特曾经表示，这些布景的感觉是参考了「天气很差时的香港街道」。
电影《银翼杀手》中的街道
1995年的动画电影《攻壳机动队》则将香港与赛博朋克更紧密地联系在一起。导演押井守认为21世纪的亚洲将主导未来世界的发展，而香港是当时其他城市效仿的对象，于是他选择了香港作为片中未来大都会「新港市」的想象蓝本。
经过押井守多次到香…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一阵秋雨过后，忽然就意识到气温的变化，于是给衣橱换季也不得不提上了日程。
从收拾夏日衣物并分批洗涤，到把冬衣填进衣柜、不再穿的衣服送去衣物回收，一共用了三四天的时间。其中大部分时间都用在洗涤和晾晒，专门用来收拾布局的只有不到一天的时间。
之前的每次换季都不可避免地会撞上搬家，所以正儿八经的衣橱换季还是第一次。以下就是我这次整理衣橱的心得，另有对消费和断舍离的反思，希望对你有所帮助。
第一步：辞旧
此处的「旧衣服」指的是夏季的衣物，还有一些不打算再穿的衣服。
夏季出汗多，为了防止汗渍沉积，因此需要在收纳前清洗干净。如果是年初的冬夏换季，需要注意的是不能烘干的毛衣等需要更长的时间手洗、晾干，可能需要提前预留更多时间。
第一步就是把所有冬天不准备再穿的衣服都拿出来，掏干净口袋后分门别类放进不同的洗衣袋里。我的分类依据主要是洗涤方式：只可机洗不能烘干的，以及可机洗可烘干，深浅分开，一共四筐。另外还有一个纸箱，专门用来放不准备再穿的衣物。
 
洗涤先从至少需要过夜晾干的娇贵衣服开始，然后是可烘干的那些。中间我留了足够的时间，以确保大部分的衣服都能在差不多的时间内足够干爽，可以安心放进储藏室而不用担心发霉。
接下来，就是把所有衣服，按照洗涤方式分类放入收纳箱。家里的教诲是「把娇贵的衣服放在最上层才不容易被压坏」，但以我对自己的了解，天气热起来的时候肯定直接从最上层拿衣服，所以在上层放好洗的普通衣物总没错；同理，冬装收纳的最上层也是轻薄的毛衣。
这个过程中，我没有把所有洗干净的衣服都放进收纳箱，而是专门留下了许多不打算再穿的衣服。关于我的「断舍离」，会在后面有一节详细讲述。
而收起来准备明年再穿的衣服，都和一小块檀香皂放进可密封的袋子里，明年拿出来再穿的时候，衣服上就自然染上好闻的香气了！除了檀香皂，还可以尝试樟木球、香挂，以及切成小段、放进纸袋里的线香，都是可以持续散发香气、且味道不会…]]></summary>
