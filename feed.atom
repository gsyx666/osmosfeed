LG Display has developed a new “invisible” speaker technology for vehicles that uses a passport-sized vibrating panel to generate sound. It was developed with an unnamed “global audio company” and is expected to be ready for car interiors next year for installation in places like the dashboard and headliner.
The south-Korean tech giant’s Thin Actuator Sound Solution is being promoted as a replacement for traditional speaker systems within cars and other vehicles. Unlike current in-car speaker systems that use heavy components like voice coils, cones, and magnets, the Thin Actuator Sound Solution uses LG Display’s film-type exciter technology to generate sound by vibrating off display panels and various materials within the vehicle, which...

Traditionally, adding a load more button which sends a request to the database to load more data is done with JavaScript.

First, we need to set up our Django project by first creating a virtual environment and installing the necessary dependencies.

python -m venv my_project

Next, we need to change the directory into the newly created virtual environment with the command below;

I previously talked about how you can simulate a production load using Gatling Load-Test-as-Code. Gatling provides a way for you to write client requests in code, and run it from your local machine with different injection rates that you specify.
In the real world scenario, traffic does not come from just one client. Multiple users login from different clients and this creates a different scenario in comparison to a load test from just one machine. With more than one client, there are other factors that come in to play that affects performance, specifically on establishing the connection between client and server.

As Gatling load tests are written in code, and ran with scripts, you can always make use of any pipeline tool to…]]></summary>

For example Array.from is a static method, which can be called from the Array class itself, whereas Array.prototype.includes is an instance method, which can be called from the actual array itself.
Array.from() is a static method of the Array class. It creates a new Array instance from an array-like or iterable object.

Kubernetes defines Limits as the maximum amount of a resource to be used by a container.
Requests, on the other hand, are the minimum guaranteed amount of a resource that is reserved for a container.
Knowing that, we should configure our containers and Pods properly in order to get the best of both.

Dwayne McDaniel
Mon, 11/21/2022 - 03:00

            
When I talk to people about Git, almost everyone has a strong reaction to the git rebase command. This command has caused many people to change directory, remove the repository, and just re-clone to start over. I think this comes from misconceptions about how branching actually works, a pretty terrible default interface, and some merge conflicts mucking things up.
Git squash
If you've ever made a lot of commits locally and wish there was a way to smash them all down into a single commit, you're in luck. Git calls this concept "squashing commits." I discovered the concept while working on documentation. It took me over a dozen commits to finally get a bit of markdown just right. The repo maint…]]></summary>

程序员和开发人员在其工作或项目中会使用各种工具和应用程序，包括代码编辑器、编程语言编译器、附加组件、数据库等。如果你对现代开发者的工作流程进行分类，它包含以下典型的工作流程：


访问代码库

编程

调试

测试

部署


而这种典型的工作流程可能需要各种工具。一个标准的清单可能是这样的：


代码编辑器

简单的文本编辑器

网页浏览器（网页开发者需要所有变体）

数据库引擎

一个本地服务器

编程语言相应的编译器

调试器

可以说，与 Windows 相比，Linux 是编程的最佳选择。（出于几个原因，我在本文中不对 macOS 进行比较。）Linux 是最佳选择的主要原因是，与 Windows 相比，在 Linux 发行版中已经预装具有现代技术的软件包和应用程序，或非常容易安装。

因此，在这篇文章中，我们想列出 2022 年最适合程序员的 Linux 发行版。

2022 年适合程序员的十大 Linux 发行版

1、Fedora Workstation



也许这个名单中最完美的 Linux 发行版是 Fedora Linux。它用于桌面的默认 Workstation 版通过其选择的软件包带来了正宗的 GNOME 桌面体验。

Fedora Linux 的默认安装为你提供了所有主要的开发包，开箱即用。它们包括 PHP、OpenJDK、PostgreSQL、Django、Ruby on Rails、Ansible 等。

通过 dnf 软件包管理器安装更多的应用程序是非常简单的，如 VS Code 编辑器和其他软件包。你也可以借助“软件Softw…]]></summary>

In a sudden turn of events, Disney has reversed the CEO swap that surprised us in early 2020, with Bob Iger returning to his post, replacing his own successor, Bob Chapek. Iger, who is also the company’s largest shareholder, is now set to serve a new two-year term as CEO. Part of Iger’s job in those two years will be to pick and groom his long-term successor.
Of course, Chapek was an Iger choice too. Chapek had been called the “Tim Cook to Iger’s Steve Jobs,” but during his tenure, their handover got off to a rocky start, while blowups like the Scarlett Johansson Black Widow lawsuit and Disney’s initial lack of reaction to the “Don’t Say Gay” bill in Florida scuffed its all-important reputation.

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15274-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是你如何在 Debian、Ubuntu 和其他发行版中修复 “bash: wget command not found” 的错误。


著名的 wget 工具被用来通过终端从 URL 下载任何文件。它是 Linux 终端中最流行和最快速的工具之一。

作为一个 GNU 工具，wget 带来了一些奇妙的功能。你可以实现各种目的，如从网上提取信息、下载文件、暂停/恢复等。

然而，许多 Linux 发行版 在默认安装时并没有附带这个工具。因此，当你想用 wget 下载一些文件时，你会得到 wget 命令未找到的错误。

修复它其实很容易。

修复 wget 命令未找到

你所需要做的就是打开终端，运行以下命令来安装 wget。

对于 Ubuntu、Linux Mint、elementaryOS、Debian 和相关发行版：

sudo apt install wget


Arch Linux：

pacman -S wget


对于 Fedora（虽然它默认包括）：

sudo dnf install wget


安装后，你就可以使用 wget 程序了。你也可以通过检查其版本来验证它是否正确安装。

wget --version


如何使用 wget

下面是一些关于如何使用 wget 的例子。

命令的语法如下：

wget [选项]… [URL]…


例如，如果我想下载 Ubuntu 的 ISO 文件，那么我可以运行下面的命令，用 URL 直接下载。

wget https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04.1/ubuntu-22.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso




同样，你也可以使用上述命令下载，或者，通过下面描述的几个开关组合。你也可以通过 wget --help 命令得到这个：


-t, --tries=NUMBER 设置重试次数为 NUMBER（0 为不限）

--retry-connrefused 即使连接被拒绝，也要重试

--retry-on-http-error=ERRORS 逗号分隔的 HTTP 错误列表，以便重试

-O, --output-document=FILE 将文件写入 FILE 中

--nc, --no-clobber 跳过那些会下载到现有文件的下载（即覆盖它们）

--no-netrc 不要试图从 .netrc 中获取证书

-c, --continue 继续已部分下载的文件

--start-pos=OFFSET 从 OFFSET 位置开始下载

--progress=TYPE 选择进度条类型

--show-progress 在详细模式下显示进度条

--N, --timestamping 不重新获取文件，除非比本地文件新

--no-if-modified-since 在时间戳模式下不使用条件性的 if-modified-since 获取请求的资源

--no-use-server-timestamps 不以服务器上的时间戳来设置本地文件的时间戳

--S, --server-response 打印服务器响应

--spider 不下载任何东西

-T, --timeout=SECONDS 设置所有的超时值为 SECONDS 秒

--dns-timeout=SECS 将 DNS 查询超时设置为 SECS

--connect-timeout=SECS 将连接超时设置为 SECS

--read-timeout=SECS 设置读取超时为 SECS

--w, --wait=SECONDS 在两次检索之间等待 SECONDS 秒（适用于检索的 URL 超过 1个）

--waitretry=SECONDS 在检索的重试之间等待 1 到 SECONDS 秒（适用于检索的 URL 超过 1 个）

--random-wait 在两次检索之间等待 0.5WAIT 到 1.5WAIT 秒（适用于检索的 URL 超过 1 个）


总结

我希望这个指南能帮助你解决 Linux 发行版中的 wget 错误。显然方案是非常简单的。

如果有帮助或者你有任何问题，请在下面留言。

Tesla’s recalling over 321,000 vehicles over a software glitch causing the taillights on some cars to illuminate improperly (via Reuters). According to a filing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the recall covers certain 2023 Model 3 vehicles and 2020 to 2023 Model Y vehicles.
Tesla says the rear lights on one or both sides of the vehicle may “intermittently illuminate” due to an issue “that may cause false fault detections during the vehicle wake up process.” The NHTSA says this could “increase the risk of a collision” in dark conditions, but Tesla hasn’t received any reports of injuries or accidents related to this problem. Like most Tesla recalls (except this one affecting the Model 3’s seat belt buckles), the...

Jason David Frank, an actor and mixed martial artist best known for his role as Tommy Oliver in the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, has died at age 49, as first reported by TMZ (via Gizmodo). Fellow Power Rangers stars Walter Jones, Blake Foster, and Amy Jo Johnson have since confirmed his death on Instagram.
Born on September 4th, 1973, Frank originally starred as the Green Ranger in the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, which ran from 1993 to 1996, before swapping to the White Ranger during its second season. His character popped up in other Power Ranger seasons as well, including Wild Force, Turbo, Zeo, Dino Thunder, Megaforce, and HyperForce.

Federal law enforcement arrested and charged two Russian individuals with criminal copyright infringement over their alleged involvement with the pirated ebook Z-Library. Z-Library, which has been around since 2009, billed itself as the “world’s largest ebook library” before the US government shut down the site earlier this month.
According to the Department of Justice, the pair in question, Anton Napolsky and Valeriia Ermakova, were arrested in Argentina at the request of the US government on November 3rd. In addition to criminal copyright infringement, the two are also facing charges of money laundering and wire fraud.

Despite both using DallE 2, the artist still won (!!)

This sent me down the "prompt engineering" rabbit hole (where I studied every book and blog post I could find).

Eventually I broke the process down to 7 main modifiers that are super commonly used (artist, style, type, quality, lighting, proximity, and photography).

As you can guess, my AI generated images became way, wayyyyy better. So we decided to turn it into a tool 🙂

We hope you like it too!

As users migrate away from Twitter, many wonder what the equivalent of the famous blue checkmark is on Mastodon. Ignoring debates about how anyone can be sure of anyone's true identity online, it's easy to verify yourself on Mastodon when you have a WordPress site.
1. Get your verification code
Sign in to your Mastodon account and click the edit profile link under your Mastodon handle.

In the Edit Profile screen that appears, scroll down to the Verification section. This section contains a special verification code. Click the Copy button to copy your verification code to your clipboard.

MacOS 包管理器 Homebrew 的创建者新开发了一个名为 Tea 的包管理器，作为 Homebrew 的最终继承者。Tea 除了一些包管理器的新功能之外，还有一种基于区块链的方法，以确保开源软件的创造者、维护者和贡献者都能为他们的努力获得报酬。他从 NFT 中获得了灵感，简单来说，关注开源软件生态健康的人可以购买通证并质押，而 Tea 作为一个 DAO 会奖励质押者和注册的软件包及其依赖关系的贡献者。

老王点评：一个探索的方向，不过我不是很看好。




协调世界时将停止添加“闰秒”

11 月 18 日，全球代表在计量大会（CGPM）上投票决定，“从 2035 年起，将搁置在官方时钟上增加‘闰秒’以使其与地球自转同步的做法。”这意味着从 2035 年开始，或者可能更早，天文时间（称为 UT1）将被允许与协调世界时（UTC）相差一秒以上，甚至多达一分钟，而协调世界时是以原子钟的稳定滴答为基础。添加闰秒的做法始于 1972 年。


消息来源：《自然杂志》



老王点评：添加闰秒给互联网服务和各种依赖精确计时的服务带来很多麻烦，而且我们可能还面临着史无前例的负闰秒。取消了也好。




GIMP 2.99.14 发布

这是迈向 GIMP 3.0 的最新开发版本，GIMP 3.0 将从 GTK2 切换到 GTK3 工具箱，并有大量仍在开发中的其他改进。此版本的具体改进没有什么太值得说的，在发布公告中说，“从 3.0 的路线图中可以看出，大多数项目都‘接近完成’或‘已经完成’。……真正接近了 GIMP 3.0 的发布。……开始针对具体的痛点，很多痛点。”

Fedora Workstation 37 中包含的 GNOME 核心应用已经进行了一轮调整和改进：


“文件Files”应用已移植到 GTK 4，并且用户界面有许多改进。这里只是其中的一些：

它现在是自适应的，这意味着它会自动调整到更窄的尺寸，从而更好地利用可用空间。

列表视图已重新设计，使橡皮筋选择更容易。

重新设计了 “属性Properties” 和 “打开方式……Open With…” 对话框。 




“日历Calendar”应用有一个新的边栏，可以一目了然地显示即将发生的事件。它与“联系人Contacts”应用一起，现在具有自适应用户界面。

“角色Characters”应用现在会向你显示不同的肤色、头发颜色和表情符号的性别选项。

“软件Software” 中的包源选择器已重新设计并移至更显眼的位置。

“地图Maps”应用已移植到 GTK 4。

“设置Settings”应用包括一个新的“设备安全Device Security”面板，让你可以轻松查看你的设备提供或缺少的硬件安全功能！ 


新补充的默认壁纸

Fedora Workstation 37 附带一组新的补充壁纸。 在这里看看它们是如何制作的！



Fedora Linux 37 的底层变化

Fedora Linux 37 具有许多底层更改。以下是一些值得注意的：


现已正式支持树莓派 4 单板机，包括 3D 加速！

在 BIOS 系统上的新安装将使用 GPT 磁盘布局，而不是传统的 MBR 布局。在 BIOS 系统上，安装程序镜像现在还将使用 GRUB 而不是 syslinux 进行引导。

如果你禁用然后重新启用 SELinux，或运行 fixfiles onboot 命令，文件系统的重新标记过程现在将并行完成，从而显着提高速度。

波斯语的默认字体已从 DejaVu 和 Noto Sans Arabic 更改为 Vazirmatn，为在波斯语中使用 Fedora Linux 的用户提供更一致的体验。


还有这些...

Fedora 项目中发生的很酷的事情！


Fedora CoreOS 和 Fedora Cloud Base 已升级为 “版本Edition” 级别！

Fedora Linux 系统安装程序，带有新 GUI 的 Anaconda 预览安装程序镜像将在大约一周内可用。我将发布一篇文章以提供更多详细信息，敬请关注！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本文中，我们将讨论网络连接最基本的诊断工具之一：ping 命令。




如今，联网计算机变得十分普遍，以至于我们大多数人都理所当然地认为，房间一侧的计算机可以连接上房间另一侧的计算机，更不用说能连接上世界的另一端的计算机了。如此，网络使互联网、云、文件共享、媒体流、远程管理、打印等服务成为可能。但是当网络出现问题时，有时很难诊断到底是其中哪一环节出现了问题。下面，我们就来介绍：网络连接最基本的诊断工具之一—— ping 命令。

基本的 ping 命令

当你无法访问本地网络上的计算机或互联网上的服务器时，你可以 ping 它的 IP 地址。ping 将 互联网控制报文协议Internet Control Message Protocol（ICMP）数据包发送到目标 IP 地址。当我们要对网路连接状况进行判断时，ICMP 是个非常有用的协议，本质上 ICMP 是一个响应和应答信号。

让我们由近及远地进行故障排除。请先 ping 你自己的计算机，以确保你的计算机正在运行 网络栈networking stack。你正在操作的计算机称为 主机localhost，本地回环地址是：127.0.0.1。

ping 命令能用主机的 主机名 hostname、IP 地址（即 127.0.0.1）或者仅仅用简写 0 来表示 “主机”。

你可以使用 -c 选项，来控制发送数据包的 次数count。

$ ping 0 -c 1
PING 0 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.069 ms

--- 0 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% pack…]]></summary>

The app is easy to use and gives a simple overview of your worked hours, either per day or week. You can get notified when it is time to leave, view your work history, and automatically clock in and out with the premium location based clocking feature.

Over time I will be adding more features, but won’t spoil anything yet to keep off the pressure on myself.

I hope the app can also help you getting a better grip on your work time.

Feedback is always welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Focal is the supporting architecture your Notion workspace demands. 

👉🏼  If you're anything like me, you've probably tried (and failed) to keep on top of your productivity with to-do lists, planners and other methods only to find yourself in the same position a few weeks later. 

👉🏼  Focal helps you to take a step back and look at the bigger picture by asking you the right questions to set goals that are aligned with your identity and breaking these goals down into manageable tasks that you can complete each day.

👉🏼  Focal offers a methodical way of setting goals, reflecting on progress and adjusting as needed by using a system of Spheres and Arcs to categorise your life.


Focal helps you to: 

✔️ Simplify and declutter your Notion workspace using a system of Spheres and Arcs. Focal helps you to focus on what matters by breaking down your life into Spheres. Each Sphere has a number of Arcs that correspond to different areas of your life. 

✔️ Break down big goals into manageable tasks by laddering up daily tasks to sequential weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly goals. Stay focused and motivated by only showcasing small daily and micro tasks to complete. 

✔️ Set, track and stay accountable to your goals using the reflection templates across the weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly timelines. Finally, start doing those weekly reflections on a consistent basis!


🧐   Want to learn more about Focal?   Jump over to Gumroad to find a full product description.

💬   I'll be around all day so drop any questions/comments here or send me a dm on Twitter.


🥳 p.s. use the code FOCAL at checkout for 25% off!

11 月 15 日，Meta 公司发布了一个名为 Galactica 的新的大型语言模型。它是一个用于科学的大型语言模型，由 4800 万篇科学文章、网站文章、教科书、讲义和维基等训练而成。Meta 公司将其模型宣传为研究人员和学生的捷径，说它“可以总结学术论文，解决数学问题，生成维基文章，编写科学代码，为分子和蛋白质做注解，等等。”但是，像所有的语言模型一样，Galactica 只是一个无意识的机器人，无法区分事实与虚构。几小时内，科学家们就在社交媒体上分享了它有偏见和不正确的结果。三天后，Meta 撤下了它的在线演示版本。

老王点评：这可能是最短命的 AI。不过抛开夸大的宣传，它或许会有一些更务实的用途。




中国在全球顶级芯片峰会上发表的论文数超越美国

国际固态电路会议（ISSCC）将于明年初在旧金山举行。据会议委员会称，本次会议通过了筛选的 198 篇论文中有 59 篇来自中国，42 篇来自美国，32 篇来自韩国。中国论文数从第三位上升到第一位，中国在每个类别的入选研究论文数量都有所增加。ISSCC 于 1954 年首次举行，它是该领域最大和最著名的国际会议。

对多因素认证的攻击正在增加

三年前，针对多因素认证（MFA）的攻击非常罕见，因为很少有机构启用 MFA。但随着微软、谷歌等开始推行多因素认证，对它的攻击开始增加。在这些攻击中，攻击者破坏了发给已经完成多因素认证的人的令牌，并复制该令牌以获得不同设备的访问。令牌是 OAuth 2.0 身份平台的核心，其目的是使用户的身份验证更简单、更快速，并能抵御密码攻击。微软的检测和响应团队发现攻击者为此目的利用令牌盗窃的情况有所增加。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[@nrek ) and in 2017 I started to put an application together to address the Tokyo 2020 Olympics called Wandur. The market research, consumer analysis, application POC, and various other aspects of the product were all pieced together through the end of 2019, with a  plan to launch at the end of Q4 2019. 

COVID. 

Well, everything got put on hold, and the Olympics came and went. Now, here we are, post-pandemic, 5 years after the inception of an idea, 3 years after developing the POC, and just a few months after vaccination cards and mask requirements have been lifted, ready to rock again. 

The launch phase of Wandur lacks layers of complexity to focus on user acquisition by providing curated maps that help navigate landmarks through scenic areas of walkable tourist destinations. This period exists to allow Wandur to accumulate gig workers who will operate as travel guides/companions. The path is pretty straightforward - gather users, make guides available, and release follow-up features based on app usage. 

It's just a matter of marketing, timing, and narrow focus - it's why we've chosen Rome, Italy as the first city where Wandur will be available. Wandur is set to launch in early/mid 2023.

Keyboards are necessary to work with a computer system whether it's for coding, writing, or moving around items in a spreadsheet. They allow access to a computer's peripherals and are used to get deep into the operating system of any computer. Keyboards come in all shapes and sizes. Some are more comfortable to use than others. We asked our community members to share the best (and the worst) keyboard they'd ever used. Some of the answers might surprise you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用这个开源工具，即使是批量校正图像也很容易。


多年前，在翻阅一家旧书店的书架上的内容时，我偶然发现了一本名为 《UNIX System Command Summary for Berkeley 4.2 & 4.3 BSD》 的小册子，由 Specialized Systems Consultants 出版。我买它是出于好奇，因为它已经有将近 20 年的历史了，但仍然在很大程度上适用于现代 Linux 和 BSD。

无论是当时还是现在，我都很开心。一本写于 1986 年的小册子在 2016 年仍然很重要，而同一个书架上关于专有操作系统的书籍并不值得印刷它们的纸张。（想一想：你认为什么技术可以在僵尸末日中幸存下来？）这本小册子已经放在我自己的书架上好几年了，但我突然想到可能值得对这个作品做一点数字保存，所以我决定扫描这本小册子来创建一本 CBZ 电子书。

使用 Skanlite 进行扫描很容易，但很耗时。然而，当我完成后，我发现有些页面不是很平整。



在打印中，这称为配准问题，这意味着打印内容的位置在页面上的方向不正确。

ImageMagick

ImageMagick 是基于终端的非交互式图形编辑器。尝试在无图形环境（如纯文本终端）中编辑图形似乎违反直觉，但实际上很常见。例如，当你将图像上传到 Web 应用用作个人资料图片时，应用服务器上的脚本可能会使用 ImageMagick 或其库处理你的图像。非交互式编辑器的优点是你可以制定需要对示例图像执行的操作，然后只需按一下按钮即可将这些效果应用于数百个其他图像。

ImageMagick 通常与其他图形编辑器一样强大，只要你花时间了解它的许多功能以及如何组合它们以实现所需的效果。在这种情况下，我想旋转歪斜的页面。在搜索了 ImageMagick 的文档后，我发现我需要的解决方案的 ImageMagick 术语称为纠偏。将你的术语与其他人的术语保持一致对于你不知道的任何事情都是一个挑战，因此当你使用 ImageMagick（或其他任何东西）时，请记住，你描述问题或解决方案的用词可能和别人不一样。

要使用 ImageMagick 对带有弯曲文本的图像进行校正：

$ convert page_0052.webp -deskew25% fix_0052.webp


-deskew 选项表示可接受偏差的阈值。通过跟踪看似字母的对象的峰谷来确定倾斜。根据扫描的弯曲程度，你可能需要多于或少于 25% 的阈值。我已经达到了 80%，到目前为止，低于 25% 没用效果。

结果如下：



修复了！将其应用于文档的剩余 55 页以修复倾斜的页面，而对已经笔直的页面不做任何事情。换句话说，由于我的阈值设置，在不需要调整的页面上运行此命令是安全的。

使用 ImageMagick 裁剪图像

在纠正了歪斜之后，因为我扫描每一页都比必要的范围要多，以防止意外切断单词，我认为裁剪我纠正的页面是有意义的。我很高兴在页边空白处保留一些空间，但没有以前那么多。我经常使用 ImageMagick 的“裁剪”功能来处理这个网站上的图像，所以我很熟悉这个选项。但是，我需要确定如何裁剪每一页。

首先，我需要图像的大小：

$ identify fixed_0052.webp
WEBP 1128x2593 1128x2593+0+08-bit sRGB 114732B 0.020u 0:00.021


知道尺寸后，我能够对我可以承受的丢失多少像素做出一些估计。经过几次试运行，我得到了这个：

convert fix_0052.webp -gravity Center -crop 950x2450+0+0 crop_0052.webp


这并不完全适合，但当我将它应用于册子中的其他图像时，它被证明很重要。这些页面的内容和扫描仪位置各不相同，所以我很高兴给每一页一点空余空间。

这是校正和裁剪的图像：



使用开源批量编辑图像

ImageMagick 的美妙之处在于，当你确定了修复图像的公式，你就可以将该修复应用于需要相同修复的所有图像。我使用 GNU Parallel 执行此操作，它使用我所有的 CPU 内核来完成数百页的图像校正。这并不需要很长时间，而且结果不言而喻。更重要的是，我已经有了一个 UNIX 历史上有趣作品的数字档案。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这些年来，我通过这些开源资源提高了我的 Python 技能。


我最近决定进一步学习 Python，以便提高我的教学技能，拓宽我的学生的视野。在这个过程中，我发现了这些优秀的资源，让我学习新的代码，并提高了对 Python 的整体理解。

1、《教孩子学编程 Python 语言版》

我的 Python 之旅大约是 7 年前开始的，当时我发现了 Apple LOGO 和 Python 中的 Turtle 模块 之间的联系。当时使用的 Linux 计算机的默认 Python 版本为 Python 2.7，我很快发现我想使用 Python 3。我成功地安装了它，并开始使用 Turtle 模块编写一些简单的程序。在阅读 Dr. Bryson Payne 的 《教孩子学编程 Python 语言版》 之后，我意识到 Python 不仅仅是 Turtle。那时我安装了 IDLE。

2、IDLE

在使用 IDLE 工作的过程中，交互式界面优化了我的体验，并让我有足够的信心来考虑向学生教授 Python。我志愿帮助我社区中的一群在家学习的孩子，很快我发现自己在教授一个有十六个孩子的班级！我很高兴他们的父母同意帮助我，否则我想我会被压垮。这个经历激发了我学习更多的欲望，以便我可以教授更多。

3.、Mu 编辑器

2018 年春天，我参加了 PyConUS。我听了一场由中学老师 Nicholas Tollervey 主讲的演讲，他为学龄前儿童编写了一个 Python 开发环境。Mu 编辑器 内置了一个可以帮助我找到代码中的错误的 质检工具Linter。Mu 帮助我提高了我的编码技能，我也能够与学生分享这些技能，他们也从中受益。

我的自信和经验增长后，我希望与更多的学生分享 Python 之旅。我与其他人合作撰写了一个申请书，以教授一个使用树莓派 4 和 Python 的课程。疫情打断了这个计划。在此期间，树莓派基金会发布了树莓派 400。2021 年春天，我使用了前一年开发的材料和一个来自当地图书馆的慷慨的资助，来 教授两组 学生如何编程。这个活动非常成功并在今年再次举办。

4、Codium

几年前，我了解到微软的 VS Code 是一个可以在 Linux 上使用的开源代码编辑器。我最近才了解到，如何在 VS Code 中配置和使用 Python 虚拟环境。我的问题在一篇 关于虚拟环境的文章 中得到了解答，这让我可以知道如何在 Linux 计算机上设置和配置 Python 虚拟环境。大约在同一时间，我发现了 Codium，一个围绕 VS Code 构建的社区项目。

现在我希望与我的学生分享 VS Codium 的体验，并让他们对 Python 的理解不再局限于 Turtle 模块。这种学习的热情让我寻找开源且可以在互联网上随意获得的教学资源。

5、《Python 编程练习，简单解释》

《Python 编程快速上手 让繁琐工作自动化》 这本书是我最喜欢的一本书。现在，作者已经发布了 《Python 编程练习，简单解释》。这两本书都可以免费在线阅读，并且都采用了知识共享许可证。

6、《每个人都可以使用 Python》

Dr. Charles Severance 在 2017 年发布了 《每个人都可以使用 Python》，我非常推荐这本书。他为像我这样的有抱负的程序员提供了简短的课程。课程的代码可以在 GitHub 上找到，所以你可以下载它并在自己的计算机或学校网络上安装它。

7. Python 视频

最近，我了解到 Jay LaCroix 在 YouTube 上有一系列精彩的视频，其中包括 28 个免费视频，从 Python 基础开始，涵盖了 Python 编程 的全面介绍。最重要的是，他使用的是 Linux 计算机，因此他的课程特别适合 Linux 编程环境。这些视频的其中一个收获是学习如何使用 nano 作为编程环境，它默认情况下包含在大多数 Linux 发行版中。

你的学习之路

此处提到的这七个资源帮助我成长为一名程序员，它们都是开源的并可以与其他人分享。你是如何提高编程技能的？你有什么要分享的吗？在评论中告诉我们。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[@itsmaleen, I'm super stoked to introduce Jive 😊

Why Jive
==========
The main thing that keeps us coming back to Twitter is the content. Specifically, the nuggets of value hidden in great threads written by brilliant builders and creators. From how-tos to opinion pieces, we've found that threads are a treasure trove of information that rival any blog.

The Problem
==========
Although there is a lot of value in Twitter threads, and that creators put lots of time / energy into creating them, there is no real place for them to live permanently. Too often do great threads fade away in the avalanche of new content. Now that there is some concern about the future of the platform, we want to ensure that no content gets lost.

The Solution
==========
So, why not help creators turn their already written out content into a personal blog? Well, that's what we did.

For Creators:
✍️ Automatically turn threads into a personal blog
📈 Track analytics across topics and posts
🔭 Have your content discoverable with a new audience

For Readers:
🧭 Explore new topics and creators
🔖 Bookmark relevant threads
🖤 Follow topics that interest you

If you want an easier way to go through valuable Twitter content without the noise, or if you want to leverage your existing work, join Jive!

Coming soon: export your Twitter threads to publishing platforms you love (whether that's Jive, Medium, Mirror, etc.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一半的 macOS 恶意软件都来自一个“杀毒软件”

Elastic 安全实验室发现，一半 macOS 恶意软件来自 MacKeeper。讽刺的是，MacKeeper 声称 “以零努力保持你的 Mac 清洁和安全”。该程序可以被威胁者滥用，因为它有广泛的权限和对进程和文件的访问。这意味着，一个旨在保持 Mac 安全不受网络威胁的程序可能使你的系统处于危险之中。 MacKeeper 也以难以完全卸载而著称。然而，Mac 仍然是恶意软件最少的操作系统，研究发现只有 6.2% 的恶意软件出现在 macOS 上，而 Windows 和 Linux 上则分别为 54.4% 和 39.4%。


消息来源：Neowin



老王点评：这可真够讽刺的，一个杀毒软件反而是最大的黑窝。




开源推动 5G 占据了 50% 的电信市场

5G 部署现在已经超过 50% 的电信市场规模，这得益于开源。Linux 基金会称，在这一切的背后，“是向开放网络和框架的彻底转变。无论经济和政治风向如何，这种转变都在继续。事实上，开源可能是唯一没有受到影响的领域，因为它有能力跨越国界和边界来做需要做的事情。”据一些分析师的说法，到 2030 年，5G 的经济价值将达到 7 万亿美元。


消息来源：ZDNet



老王点评：开源居然对 5G 的推广有这么大的作用，这是有些想不到。




Mozilla 收入更多样，但仍然主要依靠谷歌

Mozilla 今天发布了其年度《Mozilla 状况》报告，2021 年，Mozilla 公司从搜索合作、订阅和广告收入中获得了 5.85 亿美元，比前一年增长了 25%。除了主要来自谷歌的搜索合作的收入之外，来自 Mozilla VPN、Mozilla MDN Plus、Pocket 等新产品的收入为 5700 万美元，与前一年相比增长了 125%。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：虽然 Mozilla 也有一些让人批评的地方，但是这已经是自由开源世界不多的重要旗舰了。]]></summary>

As with any other technology or skill, just reading about Git cannot make you proficient at it or make you an "advanced" user. Now it's time to dig into some of the tools in Git that I've found useful, and hopefully, that will help you use Git.
Git reflog
In my previous article, I wrote about Git history as a chain of commits, and that's a very good model for most purposes. However, Git actually remembers everything you do with Git, not just commits. You can see your entire recent history with git reflog.

The log that reflog refers to is found in .git/logs, and it's called HEAD. Opening this file, you can quickly see all the actions taken recently. Inside .git/logs/HEAD…]]></summary>

If you're migrating away from Twitter, you might be looking for a way to ensure your followers that you are who you say you are. Ignoring debates of how anyone can be sure of anyone's true identity online, it's easy to verify yourself on Mastodon if you already have your own website. This requires a very basic understanding of HTML, so if you don't maintain your own website, then send this article to your web maintainer instead.
1. Get your verification code
Sign in to your Mastodon account and click the edit profile link under your Mastodon handle.

Git has become the default way to store and transport code in the DevOps generation. Over 93% of developers report that Git is their primary version control system. Almost anyone who has used version control is familiar with git add, git commit, and git push. For most users, that’s all they ever plan to do with Git, and they're comfortable with that. It just works for their needs.
However, from time to time, almost everyone encounters the need to do something a little more advanced, like git rebase or git cherry-pick or work in a detached head state. This is where many devs start to get a bit nervous.

Linux has a good track record for software support. There are about 60 commands in man section 1 of Unix 1st edition, and the majority still work today. Still, progress stops for no one. Thanks to vast global participation in open source, new commands are frequently developed. Sometimes a new command gains popularity, usually because it offers new features, or the same features but with consistent maintenance. Here are ten old commands that have recently been reinvented.

The man page is functional, and it works well for what it does. However, man pages aren't always the most succinct at demonstrating how to use the command you're trying to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[虽然现在多屏用户逐渐变多，但仍是小众，Windows 也并没过对多屏使用进行太多的优化。所以只好自己动手，于是有了以下一些个人自用的优化设置。
窗口出现位置优化
Windows 系统仅对多屏用户提供了简单主显示器的设置，默认情况下所有新打开的窗口都只会出现在主显示器上，即使你在使用另一个的显示器。而「基于显示器连接记住窗口位置」只能记住上次关闭时所在的屏幕，实用性并不高。

这时微软自家的 Power Toys 里的 FancyZones 就可以派上用场了，除了我们熟知的窗口布局设置外，它还可以调整窗口行为，在这里我们可以通过启用「将新创建的窗口移动到当前 活动的监视器（实验性）」来达到这一效果，美中不足的是动画不够优雅。

窗口出现的问题解决了，但任务栏上默认是显示所有屏幕上的窗口，不能让我们快速区分哪些应用是在当前屏幕下的。

为了解决该问题，如下图所示，Windows 提供了简陋的选项加让人摸不着头脑的翻译。设置后，每个屏幕下的任务栏就只显示当前屏幕下打开的窗口，更符合直觉，不过 Win + 数字 的快捷键就只能在主显示器上使用了。

内容显示优化
现在 Windows 下大部分的应用都适配高 DPI 的，少部分不支持的，也可以通过 Windows 自带的属性 - 兼容性选项来调整。

上面的设置仅解决了单个应用在高分辨率屏幕下的问题，并不能解决应用在分辨率相差太大的显示器间移动时会出现界面变形问题。这时，如果你使用的 AMD 显卡，那你可以通过启用 AMD Radeon Software 里的「超虚拟分辨率」来让低分辨率屏切换到更高的逻辑分辨率，不仅缩小的多屏间的分辨率差距，还有抗锯齿的效果。由于个人没有使用 Nvidia 和 Intel 显卡，相关选项是否存在请自行到显卡设置里翻找。

设置完成后到 Windows 设置调整下逻辑分辨率和缩放即可。

除此之外，对于我们网上冲浪必备的浏览器，它的缩放是固定的，且只有一个设置选项。不知道有没有人跟我一样两个屏幕的缩放比例是不一样的，在两个屏幕间移动浏览器时，网页内容并不会根据 DPI 而变化，导致观感割裂。在这里我推荐一个 FireFox 浏览器插件：ffreszoom，它可以实时感知屏幕宽度的变化，当宽度超过指定值时，自动调整到指定缩放比例。设置前先通过这个网站查看自己的屏幕宽度：http://whatismyscreenresolution.net/，需要将 Firefox 浏览器移动到不同显示器上刷新。

如图所示我的外屏宽度是 1728 px，笔记本内屏为 1024，所以我在两者之间随意取了一个值用于判断，若当前屏幕宽度超过 1600 px，就自动设置缩放为 1.5，也即 150%。若小于 1600 px，则使用浏览器设置里的值。两种缩放无缝切换，只会多了一个缩放的动画。由于本人没使用 Chromium 类浏览器，并没有对应的插件推荐，不过其用户这么多，应该会有类似的插件。

利用「闲置的」触摸板
不知有没有跟我一样喜欢使用笔记本键盘的，且平时一些简单的操作直接用触摸板直接操作。现在 Windows 11 已经支持自定义触摸板多指手势了，但其不能根据不同应用设置不同的手势，例如：A 软件可以用 Ctrl  + W 关闭，但 B 软件只能用 Alt + F4，同一个操作有不同的快捷键。

这时就需要第三方软件了，这里我推荐 GestureSign，界面虽然是 Windows 10 风格，但不影响使用，毕竟设置完就不用再看了。它可以为不同应用的不同快捷键键设置相同的触控手势，手势类型也不再仅限于横平竖直，可以自由发挥。同时软件也内置了一些常用的命令供选择。

上图是我的一些设置，双指一般使用系统默认就不添加上去了。其中个人最爱的是三指滑动切换标签，体验比鼠标点击更加符合人的直觉。对于频繁使用搜索启动器的我，把三指上滑指定为搜索启动器的快捷键，方便呼出。
 
对了，设置前记得把系统自带的相关手势取消掉，不然会冲突。若你仍不习惯使用触摸板，该软件也支持鼠标手势，具体可以自行下载体验。
结尾
以上便是我在使用多屏时遇到的问题，及相关解决方法，希望对多屏用户有帮助。]]></summary>

世界杯赛程赛制
2022年世界杯将在中东国家卡塔尔举办，这是历史上首次在中东地区举办世界杯。
小组赛分组（来源：国际足联官网）
本届世界杯将有32支球队参加，分成8个小组。

A组：卡塔尔，厄瓜多尔，塞内加尔，荷兰
B组：英格兰，伊朗，美国，威尔士
C组：阿根廷，沙特阿拉伯，墨西哥，波兰
D组：法国，澳大利亚，丹麦，突尼斯
E组：西班牙，哥斯达黎加，德国，日本
F组：比利时，加拿大，摩洛哥，克罗地亚
G组：巴西，塞尔维亚，瑞士，喀麦隆
H组：葡萄牙，加纳，乌拉圭，韩国

世界杯31支参赛队伍由各个洲世界杯预选赛选出，其中欧洲拥有13个参赛名额，非洲5个名额，亚洲4.5个名额，南美洲4.5个名额，北美及加勒比地区3.5个名额和大洋洲0.5个名额。其中的半个名额是附加赛名额，澳大利亚和哥斯达黎加通过附加赛获得世界杯参赛资格。东道主卡塔尔自动获得参赛资格。
世界杯遵循杯赛赛制，分为小组赛和淘汰赛，与欧冠、亚冠等冠军联赛不同，世界杯小组赛为单回合制，每支队伍踢3场小组赛，积分前2名晋级淘汰赛。淘汰赛不再抽签，A组第一对阵B组第二，B组第一对阵A组第二，C组第一对阵D组第二，D组第一对阵C组第二，以此类推，同时，小组前二的两支队伍将分在上下两个半区，保证决赛前不再相遇。

Where do people come together to make cutting-edge invention and innovation happen?
The corporate lab
One possible answer is the corporate research lab. More long-term focused than most company product development efforts, corporate labs have a long history, going back to Thomas Edison's Menlo Park laboratory in New Jersey. Perhaps most famous is Bell Labs' invention of the transistor—although software folks may associate it more with Unix and the C programming language.
But corporate laboratories have tended to be more associated with dominant firms that could afford to let large staffs work on very forward-looking and speculative research projects. After all, Bell Labs was born of the AT&T telephone monop…]]></summary>

The previous two articles in this series looked at open source community health and the metrics used to understand it. They showed examples of how open source communities have measured at their health through metrics. This final article brings those ideas together, discussing the challenges of implementing community health metrics for your own community.
Organizational challenges
First, you must decide which metrics you want to examine. This requires understanding your questions about reaching your goals as a community. The metrics relevant to you are those that can answer your questions. Otherwise, you risk being overwhelmed by the amount of data available.

在介绍我的线上授课经验之前，有必要先对我当前线下授课的方式进行简单介绍，我所在的小学使用的硬件设备是希沃白板，日常完成备课后，我会到教室使用希沃白板打开 PPT 进行授课。希沃白板的便利之处在于，即便你不使用内置的同名应用「希沃白板」进行备课、授课，它仍然支持打开课件后，直接在课件上使用不同颜色的画笔进行标记、圈画，并支持橡皮擦功能，大大节省了备课时间。
此外，希沃白板通常会配备有投影仪，一般我会在习题讲评课上利用投影仪播放练习单或是课堂作业，来完成习题讲评课；或是在随堂课上实时对学生的作业、作品进行展示。希沃白板还内置了多种工具，我使用频率较高的是其内置的倒计时功能，当课堂上需要进行限时练习或讨论时，它便能派上用场。
居家授课如何复制线下经验
我手上的电脑设备一共有两台，对于使用 Windows 电脑的用户而言，在电脑上直接下载前文提到过的「希沃白板」应用，便能把制作好的课件直接导入希沃（或直接利用希沃制作课件）实现实时圈画、倒计时等常用功能。而我的 Windows 电脑借给了同样有网课需求的同事，因此我可以用来上网课的主要设备就是一台 16+256G 的 …]]></summary>

本文提供了一个使用 iPad 进行数字阅读的低成本实用方案。
使用数字工具建立工作流基本上都遵循「收集-整理-阅读-输出」这样一个基本流程。在少数派上已经有很多文章关注了获取信息、收集整理、笔记输出等方面的方法论，但似乎比较少有人专门关注「阅读」这件事情。
阅读好像是一项不言自明、人人具备的技能，但是在数字时代，如何打造自己的数字阅读方案仍然是一个值得讨论的问题。虽然数字设备摆脱了纸质材料笨重的束缚，提供了更多的内容信息来源，但是也带来了新的难题。电脑、平板、手机……什么才是更好的阅读设备？书籍、报刊杂志、网页、社交媒体信息，如何更好的整合多源信息？
我认为，一个好的数字阅读方案应当满足以下要求：

简洁实用、舒适方便，专注于阅读本身；
提供一体化的阅读平台，既能广泛容纳各类来源、形式的内容，又能方便地记录标注笔记，对接后续内容输出；
成本较低，能够为更多人所用。

围绕这些目标，这篇文章介绍了我是如何从自己的需求出发，尝试用 iPad 打造适合自己的阅读工具的，希望能够给大家提供一些参考。
关于数字阅读：我需要什么样的工具
选择有效的工具必须先明确自己的需求。作为一个社科博士研究生以及数字工具的爱好者，我的日常阅读内容与来源大致包括这几个方面：

与个人研究议题相关的中英学术书籍、论文以及报告；
其他书籍，包括人文社科经典、人物传记、非虚构类作品、小说等；
专业媒体与官方资讯，个人关注的信源如财新、晚点、联合早报、澎湃、各类官媒等；
其他互联网信息，来自微信、微博等社交媒体以及其他网站。

在过去，我的阅读方式大致是这样的：…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PicGo，一个用于快速上传图片并获取图片 URL 链接的工具。
今年是 PicGo 的五周年，虽然我真的很想推出一个大的正式版 (2.4.0) ，但是平时工作实在忙碌，只能抽空在闲暇时间写写 PicGo，因此没能交出一个让自己满意的答卷。所以本次时隔一年的更新只能以一个小版本更新。
不过对于用户来说，这个小版本还是修复了不少问题以及带来了不少新功能，我挑了其中一些比较有代表性的，快来看看吧。
Features
macOS arm64 的构建版本
从 2.3.1 版本开始，PicGo 也为 arm64 版本的 mac 带来适配的构建版本。为此，PicGo 更新了底层的 Electron 版本，跨越非常大，没少做适配。不过 arm64 版本的原生应用确实速度非常快。
如果你是 macOS 用户，但是遇到了安装、使用的问题，可以参考 PicGo 的 FAQ 最后一条进行处理。
多语言支持
一直以来 PicGo 只有简体中文的界面。从 2.3.1 版本开始，引入了 简体中文 \ 繁體中文 \ English 三种语言的界面。你可以在设置界面中切换语言。如果你想为 PicGo 添加更多的语言支持，欢迎参考贡献指南。
i18n 多语言设置
使用内置剪贴板上传
PicGo 对于剪贴板图片一直是采用脚本的方式获取的，同时不同平台的脚本不一样。但是不同的系统、用户环境会带来脚本执行结果不一定符合预期的情况。例如某些 Windows 用户使用「剪贴板上传」的时候就会遇到脚本报错或者进程残留的问题。因此这个版本新增了一个配置项，可以使用 Electron 提供的剪贴板 API 进行剪贴板图片获取以及上传。如果你遇到了上述的问题，不妨开启这个选项。
使用内置剪贴板上传
日志文件大小控制
2.3.0 版本优化了一些启动相关的日志，但是由于代码和系统的原因，某些用户会遇到写入日志死循环的问题，导致日…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[什么是合格的PPT？
我们做演示幻灯片（后用PPT指代）最好的结果是什么？就是让自己想要传达的目标与听众期待的目标尽量匹配，如何能达成这效果，那就能说这样PPT是合格的。

 
我们拿可以称之为每年“年度最佳PPT”的苹果发布会举例，苹果想要传达的是“我们又创造了一些NB的产品，快来买!"，而用户期待的是“今年又会拿什么让人惊叹的产品跟功能出来震撼到我”，苹果为了传达产品的厉害之处，会用大大的数字突出性能提升百分比，会通过一个个实际使用场景来说明新功能能够帮助用户解决痛点，会通过层层递进的方式，让爆点越来越大，惊喜接踵而来……通过一系列的手段来满足用户的期待，通过发布会让新产品特性，深刻的传达到用户脑中。

 
说完了飘在天上的，再来说些更加接地气的，例如打工人每年必须要做的年终总结PPT。
年终总结大部分人的目标应该是“快看我今年干了好多好多的事，没闲着，给我多点年终奖”，很多初入职场的打工人会把做过的所有事情堆进PPT中，来个十几页，希望领导看到，“我今年都干了这么多事情了，没有功劳也有苦劳吧”，但是这样的PPT不是领导所期望的。

领导其实期望看到的是“你为今年的目标做了什么，有什么成长，明年如何达成目标”，归根到底就是要表现出你这个人如何，有没有潜力，值不值得被激励。还有你的领导也需要对上汇报，你报告里的部分内容将会成为他的汇报内容，他要达成的汇报目标是“今年目标我们团队是这样达成的，整个团队在成长，明年我们将会达成更高的目标”，他要表现出自己是一个合格的团队领导，能够带领团队完成目标，他也希望拿到更多的年终奖或者升职。
看完上面的分析，我想你应该清楚一个合格的年终总结PPT应该怎么做了吧，多写自己是如何的优秀，如何帮助完成了团队年终目标，自己的成长以及明年的计划，对于一些与团队目标关系不大的工作，可以简单带过。
大而广之，其实做任何内容输出，都不要脱离或者偏离自己…]]></summary>

如果你经常看赶海视频的话，对这些出镜率极高的海洋生物都不会感到陌生。近年来生活类自媒体的蓬勃发展，使得赶海1这一沿海地区的常见活动也得以进入镜头，并逐渐为大众所熟知。
然而，赶海真的像视频里那样，一袋食盐、一把小铲，在沙滩上挖几下，就能轻松收获一桶海鲜吗？镜头之外的真实赶海生活，是什么样子的呢？专业赶海人都如何赶海呢？
居住在北方某沿海城市的我，虽然不是一个专业的赶海人，但几次赶海下来，倒是收获了一肚子见闻，遂整理出这篇观察日记，以飨读者。
赶海群体：什么人在赶海？
第一类是专业赶海人。专业赶海人从外观上是最容易辨别出来的群体，他们的装备专业且齐全，从头戴式探照灯到防水雨裤，从钓竿到抽虾筒。他们干活熟练麻利，且通常不会聚集作业，而是分散开来、独自行动，一人承包一片区域，维持着互不侵犯、心照不宣的默契。对他们来说，赶海是经济收入的重要来源，他们所收获的海产品可用于贩卖，有时也会「拿回自己家做着吃」。
夜钓的大爷，穿着雨裤方便下海放鱼饵。交谈中大爷自述是因身背负债而每晚赶海。摄于10月29日。
第二类是业余赶海人，以村民和游客为主，他们的熟练程度、赶海目的也各不相同。
附近村庄的居民对赶海更熟悉些，更善于寻找海洋生物的呼吸孔。尽管装备不如专业赶海人那么齐全，但他们仅凭一把小铲子和一个小桶，也能有相当不错的收获，足够做一顿饭。一次赶海时，我们碰见了一对年轻的小情侣，听口音像是附近的村民，女生向我展示了当晚的收获——小半桶的狗虾，并「打算回去拿椒盐炒着吃」。
游客则多半是抱着玩乐的心态，将赶海当成一次有趣的家庭活动。

赶海攻略：时间，装备和收获
赶海时间
赶海前需要提前查好当地的潮汐时间表，重点关注水位高度和涨潮、落潮时间。每天的落潮时间有所不同，一般初一、十五会落大潮，海水退得更远，给赶海人提供了更广阔的探…]]></summary>

下载：官网、微软商店（部分功能受限）

Fluent Search 一款不满足于只提供「Fluent 流畅」搜索体验，还想在外观、交互、工作流上进一步拓展的高颜值搜索软件。
Fluent 设计 + 个性化
相关设置页面：外观、特效、主页
颜值就是生产力，这句话在 Windows 平台似乎并没有得到很好的验证，关注 Windows 的用户都知道微软虽有设计规范，但对软件生态的掌控力约等于没有，连自家应用也不一定会及时跟进，更何况第三方软件，因此在 Windows 平台上一款遵守规范且好看的应用是可遇不可求的。身为一款随时随地都有可能跟用户打交道的应用，好看的设计会让用户体验更上一层楼。以下是其三种搜索窗口基础样式：
搜索栏 + 自定义图标、水印窗口窗口 + 主页 = 类开始菜单风格
Fluent Search 不仅自带不同风格的主题，同时也提供大量的选项让其更具个性化，从浅色、深色模式，到窗口样式、大小、字体、图标、水印、颜色、透明材质、动画等都可调整。不同于其它跨平台的应用，基于 C# 开发的 Fluent Search 可以快速跟进 Windows 新设计的同时仍有着原生的性能表现。

「流畅」搜索
相关设置页面：搜索、文件、标签、屏幕、应用内搜索、上下文、网页、进程、应用程序、UI
搜索可以说是该类软件的基本功，一个优秀的索引器决定着它的基础用户体验，Fluent Search 的索引器除了可以搜索文件、目录、设置、进程、应用程序、浏览器（火狐需要安装插件）书签和历史记录，还可以对部分格式进行全文搜索，当你只想查相关内容时，通过 files content 标签即可进行搜索，不过受限于性能，搜索内容需要超过 3 个字符才会进行搜索。
全文搜索
作为一款外国软件， Fluent Search 也提供了中文搜索，全拼、拼音首字母搜索都支持，…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2014 年，那时候我还在读大三，某一天突然萌发了一个想法，要将自己看过的书和电影记录下来。我隐隐约约感受到，沉淀自己的精神生活，竟然让我觉得人生充满意义。记录的瞬间让我觉得会有成就感；等哪天，拿起这份清单，我可以清楚回顾某段时间内看过了哪些书籍和电影，也从侧面知晓当时精神生活的丰富程度
从那时起，我的记录习惯从未断绝过，不知不觉已经 8 年。从最初的用豆瓣记录，到使用纯文本 Markdown 记录，到自己搭建博客，再到使用公众号留言自动生成博客的方式记录。有些方式比较 Geek，不适合普通人，直到去年，我开发了一款 App，来满足跟我有同样需求的普通用户
这就是「已阅：书影记录」，一款快速记录自己看过的书籍和电影的 App，并支持将精美的观影列表和书单海报一键分享给朋友。献给所有希望构建自己精神角落的人

细数曾经那些不够好用的工具
为什么要开发「已阅：书影记录」呢？我综合对比了市面上多款工具，发现如果想要记录自己看过的书籍或电影，使用的方式不外乎以下几类
Excel
这是一类以 Excel 为代表的纯手动记录工具，除了 Excel 还包括在线文档、Notion 甚至是手写到自己的笔记本等
这个方式无疑费时费力，且数据是死的，很难被二次利用（如灵活筛选、统计、分享等）
让人惊讶的是，用这个方式记录的人还真不少，毕竟大部分人找不到更好的办法
豆瓣
豆瓣很伟大，是中文互联网上最全面的书影音资料库。功能上非常丰富，但是正因为它太全了，很难在这个垂直功能上做到极致

豆瓣记录的步骤比较麻烦，且默认会被分享到公共领域，下图是豆瓣和已阅的记录界面对比

 
「豆瓣」和「已阅」的记录界面对比
无法快速回顾，比如我想查看 2022 年看过了哪些书或我看过的所有五星电影，豆瓣都无法支持
「已阅」可以方便地筛选
分享功能缺乏自定义，比如我想自定义分享 2022 年看过了哪些书或我看过的所有五…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
在经历了成都连续的半个月高温居家办公，以及两周的疫情封控后，我思考了一下关于城市生活与孤独的关系，以及如何排解孤独，理解孤独。在这一个多月中，我一直是一个人在屋子里，未曾踏出家一步。我不是一个爱做饭柴米油盐的人，就这样，在家中面对着日复一日的琐事，面对没有人可以说话的孤独，面对着工作、生活的焦虑。在与安静和极度的自由的碰撞里，除了偶尔的空虚与崩溃以外，我想分享一下我如何逐渐的找回自己的生活节奏，并喜欢上一个人安排自己的方方面面。
孤独是什么

如果我们所期待的人际关系数量和质量与我们当前实际情形存在较大差距，就会产生令人不悦的厌烦、悲伤和绝望的孤独体验（de Jong Gierveld et al.，2006）。

孤独有两种：
其一是社会隔离，指缺少朋友和熟人的社交。
你或许也有这样的感受，常常用「社恐」来武装自己，鲜少与人交流。那怕是点个外卖、出门买个东西都是能不交流就不交流。性格内向的人更喜欢和自己交流，陶醉在自己所热爱的精神世界之中。在周末和假期，相比和朋友出去游玩他们更倾向于选择在家中折腾自己的爱好，渐渐的在和陌生人交往时变的畏惧，不知所措。久而久之，除了身边寥寥无几的挚友以外，几乎没有任何的交流，孤独感进一步加深。
其二是情感隔离，指缺少亲密而深厚的情感关系。
人生活在社会中，总是会渴望着被他人理解的。有的人虽然辗转于各种聚会，时时刻刻都沉浸在热闹场合之中，但是浮于表面的热闹并不总是意味着有人真正了解自己。可能你真正渴望的目标无人诉说，心中的艰苦无人知晓。理解就像是人生的底色，我们渴望着，但却不可能有人能完全理解自己。
孤独的危害
对于大部分人来说，长期保持孤独是有一定危害的。
在生理上，长期孤独的人血压更高，更容易发生应激反应。在晚上的时候孤独也会让人辗转反侧，不仅睡眠质量下降，免疫力也会随之一起走下坡路。
在生活中，孤独有时候也会带来不少的麻烦，比如因…]]></summary>

树状结构是自上而下的，网络结构是自下而上的。
但知识还有多少种结构呢？为什么是这两种？
知识本质上是信息的一种，想了解知识的结构，也可以类比信息的结构。一直以来我回答不好这个问题。
日复一日，在日常使用知识库和产品经理的工作中，无论是对知识库中的每一张知识卡片进行整理，还是在工作中经常需要查看数据库的数据结构，都将我指向一个词「信息架构」
于是，我想起了那本经典的的「北极熊」之书 —— 《信息架构 超越 Web 设计》
并且，我在这本三年前读过的书里，找到了现在的我想要的答案。

信息结构
在《信息架构》这本书中，将信息分为了以下三种结构
组织系统：组织结构可以分为互补的三种结构
层级结构
以数据库为导向的模式
超文本

信息结构会定义用户浏览的主要方式。适用于信息架构的主要组织结构包括层级结构 、以数据库为导向的模式和超文本，每种组织结构都有其优缺点。在某些情况下，只使用一 种是合理的。但在很多情况下，需要以互补的方式使用这 3 种组织 结构。 —— 《信息架构》第六章

看到这三个结构，我恍然大悟，觉得非常了不起。
简单的三种结构，几乎可以用来解释现在所有的笔记软件。
下面我将介绍每一种结构在知识库软件中的运用。结合我日常的使用经历，也给出一些建议。
（注：目前市面上可以作为知识库的软件有很多。我只选取我有使用过的软件作为本次功能的介绍。也就是 Notion、Obsidian、Logseq、wolai…）

信息结构会定义用户浏览的主要方式。适用于信息架构的主要组织结构包括层级结构 、以数据库为导向的模式和超文本， 每种组织结构都有其优缺点。

层级结构
层级结构，即是上一层级包括下一层级的结构。
层级结构的优势和劣势都很明显。优势是其层次清晰，劣势是维护成本高。
层级结构的广度和深度均不宜…]]></summary>

又到双十一购物节，说来有趣，每年双十一我都会关注羽绒服这一品类，原因大概是冬天即将到来，我隐约有添购衣服的担忧，可又因为此时我还身穿短袖，买羽绒服有种错季购物的感觉，在将羽绒服加入购物车后往往又放弃下单。于是这些年，每到双十一，我的购物车里的羽绒服更新一次，羽绒服照片成了淘宝的皮肤挂件，年年换新。
我当然是有买羽绒服，但往往不是购物车里那件，我在淘宝上浏览的是万元左右的始祖鸟、Moncler、加拿大鹅，加入购物车里的是两千元左右的北面，但最终购买的是千元以内的波司登和优衣库轻薄款，哦对了，还有老家线下店铺的以纯羽绒服。
不过长期以往，我倒是对羽绒服有了足够多的了解，足以写下这篇有参考价值的文章，帮助人们选购羽绒服。
羽绒服的历史
人类自古以来就有利用动物皮毛御寒的历史，早在原始社会时期，人类祖先就已经初步掌握了将兽皮制作成衣物的方法，用兽皮和树叶蔽体防寒，后来逐渐出现麻、棉、丝等纺织物，人类衣物变得丰富。相对来说，人类利用禽类羽毛御寒的历史要短得多，在唐朝，人们用鹅绒和布混合填充在被子中，在十三四世纪的欧洲，人们用鸭和鹅的羽毛填充进被套中。
直到 1940 年，现代羽绒服才被发明出来，主角是美国的艾迪·鲍尔，作为一名狂热户外运动爱好者，他在一次户外钓鱼过程中差点冻死，于是决心制作一件真正保暖的外套。鲍尔找到了鹅毛的羽绒，又恰逢杜邦实验室在 1938 年发明了尼龙，尼龙织物质地紧密，与棉布相比，尼龙面料可以防止羽绒「钻绒」，于是，他将二者结合，把羽绒填充进尼龙面料的衣服，绗缝锁绒，并将第一件羽绒外套命名为「Skyliner」，申…]]></summary>

前言
毋庸置疑，如今的 Chrome 及其他基于 Chromium 的 Blink 内核浏览器因其速度快、网页兼容性好的优点，以绝对的优势占据了浏览器市场的主导地位。但与此同时，因为 Chrome 与 Chromium 被一家号称「不作恶」但处处作恶的公司所拥有，所以经常被诟病存在隐私问题。许多想要逃离 Chrome 统治的人都转向了更加自由的 Firefox 浏览器，尽管其母公司 Mozilla 近年来也是骚操作不断，但 Firefox 仍然是除 Chromium 的 Blink 和 Safari 的 WebKit 外唯一选择。
我曾经也很喜欢用 Chrome（或者说是 Chromium），使用 ArchLinux 作为主力系统的我，官方软件源中使用开源 Chromium 代码编译出的 Chromium 浏览器在当时体验基本与谷歌官方的闭源 Chrome 一致。促使我转向使用 Firefox 的契机开始于一年多前，谷歌限制了第三方浏览器对其数据同步 API 的使用，这样一来各家发行版自行编译的 Chromium 浏览器都失去了账户同步功能，这在当时引起了很多不满。从那时开始，我就开始尝试使用 Firefox 替代 Chromium 作为我的主力浏览器，并最终彻底淘汰掉了 Chromium。
无独有偶，谷歌又宣布将会在 2022 年底彻底禁用 Manifest V2 规范（后来又推迟了半年），作为替代者的 Manifest V3 规范，用谷歌的话说是为了「保护用户隐私」，限制了浏览器扩展的很多权限，其中影响最大的是禁用了 We…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本次更新：
前几天看了「赛博朋克：边缘行者」，觉得里面的拖影效果非常有趣，就在 app 里做了一下。

App 介绍：
CUBE 是一款结合 iOS 软硬件新特性来完成实时特效的 app ，希望大家在手机上就可以玩到有趣的特效。 以我看过的热门影音作品为灵感，已经完成下面三个主要特效：
LiDAR 扫描效果：
日本女团 Perfume 在 Flow 的 MV 中大量使用点云这种技术，而正好配备 LiDAR 的 iPhone 可以感知深度，生成点云。
 
采样实时图像与 LiDAR 扫描仪生成的深度图，生成 3D 粒子（点云）。至多可生成 3,000,000 个粒子。
将生成的 3D 粒子与现实世界的场景混合在一起，让你感觉身处超现实世界。

Matrix 效果：
之前 黑客帝国 4 上映，黑客帝国又变成热门话题，就很想复刻一下经典的 code rain 。
 
这一次会选蓝色药丸还是红色药丸？

液态金属效果：
 
既然都提到了黑客帝国，那么终结者也不能不提。贯穿全系列的液态金属杀手也是经典之一。CUBE 带你回到 1991 年，化身成为詹姆斯·卡梅隆所拍摄的电影「终结者 2：审判日」中的终结者 T-1000 。

App Store
 
兑换码：
如果你对上面三个特效感兴趣，你可以在这里找到兑换码。
（我把码都放到一个 notion page 里，可以回复用掉的兑换码编号，方便我编辑。）

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如何让枯燥的读书像看剧、享受美食、打游戏一样快乐？
读书上瘾模型，让读书成为一个上瘾循环。

上学的时候我比较喜欢玩游戏，但是在图书馆有很好的学习看书的氛围，游戏玩得比较少。毕业后，不再有看书的氛围了，玩游戏的频率逐渐增加，从每周1天增加到2天、后来逐步增加到7天，每天都玩游戏。
那个时候我意识到已经游戏上瘾了，打游戏占据了太多的时间，所以决定戒掉游戏，经过几次尝试，终于在2020年把游戏戒掉了。

即从游戏上瘾转变为读书上瘾，读书包括输入和输出两个步骤。输入指的是看书，从去年开始在豆瓣记录读书情况，利用周末和工作日的被动等待时间，每个月最多读过11本书。
输出分为写、说、实践3种形式。

写，发表长篇博客或简短的书评。
说，分为线上和线下两种形式，线上指在各个自媒体平台发布读书视频；线下指面对面形式，1对1的交流沟通或1对多的分享。
实践，看书不应该只停留在改变认知的程度，还要实践、改变自己的行为习惯。比如看了一本关于运动的书，不仅要有每天都运动的认知，还要付诸于每天的实践行动。

上一次玩游戏是在2020年，接下来详细介绍如何从游戏上瘾转变为读书上瘾。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文仅代表个人观点，用于记录和观望一些键帽。

PBTFANS KABUKI-CHO 歌舞伎町
2022.4 
IC Base
这套键帽是由设计师OAY （罗马音？大概能翻译成哦呀，语气词）设计的第二套键帽，此前他还设计过pbtfans的深海来客，感兴趣的可以看我之前盘点的蓝色系键帽。
这套歌舞伎町键帽，灵感来源于日本的歌舞伎町——东京的娱乐中心之一。电影院、电玩舞厅、酒吧等等，从深夜到黎明，也是为数不多的大型红灯区，我对于歌舞伎町最深刻的印象则是来自于《银魂》中主角团所居住的歌舞伎町一条街。
配色：

这次的配色非常丰富，主要还是由于个性部分选用多种不同色彩。键帽整体底色以深蓝暗色调为主，而字符和个性选用明亮的色调，如同霓虹灯招牌的颜色，侧面烘托出歌舞伎町“不眠之街”的名号，到深夜依然灯火通明、灯红酒绿。
个性部分：
大货版本
这次的现货销售是直接将个性和base进行了捆绑，还包含了四个颜色的盖帽。
个性部分主要由歌舞伎、酒精和没事组成，以及歌舞伎町的招牌和著名的“一丁目”。颜色上也是选择非常丰富，盖帽倒是提供了一种略微复古但俏皮的感觉，七字回车则是意味着现代的电力为这般灯红酒绿提供了便利。
搭配展示：
该键帽已经开售有一段时间，所以已经有玩家提供了实拍的照片，有这些实物图，能更好的帮助我们来判断是否购入。
乐总拍摄阿门JV拍摄Vanthic Noel 拍摄
键帽信息：
材质：PBT材质
高度：原厂高度
工艺：二色工艺
厂商：PBTFANS
淘宝有售卖，据悉歌舞伎町卖的很好，货量有限，kbd自己的店铺已经卖完了，经销商仍有现货。 
个人评分:7-8（深色键帽非常耐看，歌舞伎町的主题也很新鲜，个性颜色丰富,PBTFANS代工水平不错）
购买建议：喜欢这个主题的值得入手，现货也无需等待

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
仔细翻了翻我个人的钢笔产品分享，和大家讨论过的都是以著名品牌的钢笔产品为主，对于国内钢笔品牌主要还是分享英雄旗下的经典产品与创新之作，毕竟其它钢笔品牌以我个人的眼光去看，都是没有太多购买意义的产品。
对于钢笔入门我始终推荐白金preppy系列、白金小流星系列、百乐78g、凌美狩猎者这些海外品牌的平价款式。
但因为英雄的关系，国人对于暗尖结构的钢笔有着相当的偏好，并且海外知名品牌如今也没有任何纯粹的现产暗尖钢笔产品。所以如今暗尖钢笔的赛道上全是国产钢笔品牌，并且价位主战场就是十元上下的低端市场，本篇中，我在某多多以零售价格，购买了十余款销量出色的国产暗尖，文内将从暗尖钢笔的用料、设计、特点来对它们进行全面的横评对比，希望能为大家了解这些产品带来帮助。
暗尖钢笔的发源与如今价位分布

暗尖钢笔发源于人类历史上最为成功的钢笔派克51，其诞生于1939年，暨派克成立51周年，故因此得以型号命名。
派克51的暗尖结构，通过树脂包裹了笔尖，在当年革新性得提高了钢笔的气密性，并根据结构，设计了新一代的毛细供墨系统，达到了更为稳定的书写效果。
在当年，暗尖钢笔以这两点综合的超强实用性，得到了市场的一致认可，直至停产派克51累计销售4000万支，是人类历史上最为成功的系列钢笔。
之所以停产，是因为后续钢笔的气密性与供墨毛细结构材料随着现代工业不断革新，暗尖已经不再具备核心优势。
现在的暗尖钢笔从高到底个人认为是三个层次，首先是派克前年复刻了51，做了个包住明尖的假暗尖，是目前价格最高的笔款，但不怎么值得去买。其次是英雄100代表了国产暗尖金笔，曾经100多元的价格性价比非常好，如今价格普遍要200以上，还是可以买，但没曾经的极致性价比了；最后就是本篇讲的10元上下，国产的钢尖暗尖钢笔！
暗尖钢笔的特点

一、暗尖钢笔因为笔尖露出部分少，书写时可以产生形变的笔尖体积相对较小，所以书写时感…]]></summary>

在 Android 手机的宣传稿中，我们经常能听到厂商宣传其所搭载的图像传感器型号，例如索尼 IMX***、三星 S5K***、豪威 OV**** 等。但在 iPhone 的宣传中，我们就不曾听过苹果声明 iPhone 使用的图像传感器型号，一般都是使用「传感器面积增大了百分之几」「像素更大更深」「全新的高速传感器」之类的比较模糊的用词，所以对于历代 iPhone 具体使用何种传感器，互联网上有诸多不能明确的信息。此文意在将我自己搜集到的相关信息进行梳理，试图考证它们的可靠性，为之后写作 iPhone 图像传感器进化打下基础。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[写在最前面，CFE卡贵谁都知道，但是这玩意性能是真的强，不管你现在用不用得着，都建议你收藏一下，虽然现在买不起，但是梦想还是要有的嘛！
CFE-A卡是索尼从A7S3开始使用的新一代高速存储设备，以应对越来越大的视频录制码率。早先使用CFE-A卡的机型都比较贵（A7S3,FX3,A1等），受众并不多。但从A7M4的大卖和FX30的发布，越来越多的用户开始使用支持CFE-A卡的相机，如何选购一张合适的CFE-A卡就成了许多用户头疼的问题。
懂数码的都知道，索尼虽然“爱好广泛”，但唯独没有生产研发存储产品的业务，也就是说索尼的卡都是其他厂家代工的贴牌产品，理论上是不可能干得过拥有独立生产研发存储颗粒的品牌的，所谓的索尼大法黑科技在存储领域也仅仅是索尼粉丝自己加上的滤镜而已。
由于CFE-A卡是索尼独占的新卡型，在发布之初的相当长一段时间里都只有索尼原厂的卡可以选择，因为缺少比较的竞品，让许多人养成了原厂=最好的固有印象。
如今第三方的CFE-A品牌越来越多，索尼原厂卡到底是个什么水平，终于可以有一个正经的横向比较了。
市面上可以做CFE-A卡的品牌有索尼，雷克沙，天硕，和至誉科技四家，笔者手里正好分别有一张拿来比较测试，他们是

索尼原厂的80G，官方售价699;
分别是雷克沙的320G，官方售价5599带读卡器;
天硕的80G，官方售价399；
至誉科技的120G，官方售价1599;

少数派不让带货就不放链接了。

之所以价格区间跨度很大，从几百到几千，主要是为了照顾不同经济实力的用户。
测试采用的读卡器是雷克沙的RW530，是一个CFA和SD卡双卡槽的读卡器，采用USB 3.2gen2接口，两个卡槽可以同时工作，可以实现互拷的功能。

一、性能对比
1、索尼80G

首先出场的是原厂的80G，由于这张卡是在套机里一起售卖的，拆机卡很多，只要六七百。买的人很多，不过大多数都舍…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[作为一名iPhone用户，快捷指令是系统中我觉得很有趣但实际上用得不是很多的应用。
最初对快捷指令的理解仅限于将多个操作步骤简化成一个，最直观的应用就是在功能日益繁杂的APP中实现功能的一键直达，比如疫情期间的健康码。
但深入探究一番后，我认为快捷指令的本质其实是打破各个APP沙盒的壁垒，实现不同应用程序的能力互通，提升个人的自动化水平。
但事情情况并不尽如人意，虽然快捷指令编辑器提供了足够强大的编辑器，但三方应用对其支持并不好，大多数APP还是尽可能期望把用户圈在自己的生态中，没有开放足够的能力出来，这也是一款生态级应用的无奈。
想象中的快捷指令
现在应用商店的APP已经足够多，可以帮助人们解决足够多的问题，但有时候一款应用并不能完全解决某项任务，需要多个应用配合操作，如果用户可以随意调用应用中功能并组合成自己所需要完成特定任务的能力，那么用户体验和效率都将提升到新的高度。
想象一种场景，当我在观看自己感兴趣的外语视频时，因为语言的障碍可能不能足够理解视频内容，我需要一些辅助支持：我希望翻译软件能够帮我把外语翻译成母语，甚至希望语音合成软件将翻译后的语言读出来。孤立地看这个场景中的每个需求，都有应用能很好得实现：视频网站能够提供我感兴趣的内容，翻译软件能将语言进行较高准确度的翻译，语音合成软件能够将文字朗读出来。但是当这三个需求点分布在三个不同的APP时，用户就难以较高效率完成这个场景的任务。实际上每个APP的能力都被封锁在了自己APP里面。

上面说的这个场景我自己就有，但是因为没能使用现有工具很好使用，只得自己动手做了一个插件，可以朗读B站上面带有字幕的视频，因为微软的中文语音合成做得比较好，所以先放在Edge浏览器上了，目前还只支持带外挂字幕的视频，大家感兴趣也可以使用。

B站视频字幕朗读（中文同传）插件地址-> Microsoft Edge Addons
现实中的快捷指令
虽然当前快捷指令还不够优秀，但对于日常效率的提升还是有一定帮助的，特别是对于实现与苹果自带应用的互通。
举个使用的例子，每天早上我会用笔记软件记录一下昨日回顾、思考以及今日的计划，对于今日计划，我希望用待办应用去跟踪计划中事项的状态，但是手动把写过的东西在另一个APP里面再写一遍实在是太过愚蠢，于是我就写了快捷指令去实现。

实际使用中，只要选择对应的文本并在共享表单中点击对应的操作就可以同步到系统自带的提醒事项中，在mac上还可以添加快捷键一键实现（应该还可以通过「自动化」省去手动操作这一步）。
当前的快捷指令有三个亮点：

在快捷指令的编辑上采用图形化拖拽操作，相对于写脚本，这种操作显得更加友好，并且也可以支持自定义脚本的加入，甚至让我一度觉得学编程的第一个应用是用快捷指令写得；
在快捷指令的运行上打通了Siri、小组件以及共享操作，特别是后者，为与三方应用的结合提供了基础的平台；
加入了自动化功能，可以根据一定的规则直接省去了用户主动调用快捷指令这一步。

但要让更多的人在更多场景下使用快捷指令，还有着一些明显的不足：

上手使用上有一些门槛，官方没有详细的教程，虽然提供了一些案例，但是大多数人应该没有耐心仔细去看快捷中心中那些精选的指令是如何实现的，这点Mac上快捷指令前辈「自动操作」可能给点其启示，其中「录制」功能可以通过「我做给你看」自动识别操作中的事件；
快捷指令的分发做得还不够，既然不是每个人都能轻松使用快捷指令，那么获取现成的快捷指令则更加重要，但快捷指令中心中精选的指令本土化、个性化做得并不好，我觉得如果能根据用户所安装的APP来个性化分发常用的快捷指令会更友好；
三方应用的能力开放明显不足，大多数的使用场景还是围绕在苹果自带应用提供的能力，这点极大限制了快捷指令的应用场景；
使用Siri来激活快捷指令时对于指令的识别非常差，官方有说使用快捷指令的名称就可以通过Siri调用，但实际使用时不时语音识别不出来就是调用的指令不正确；

有趣的是，在WWDC2022中，我们看到苹果开始推广App Intent框架，通过为应用开发者提供更多系统级的入口曝光来吸引他们将其应用所能满足的用户意图曝光给系统，从而使得系统可以通过学习用户行为实现跨应用的能力整合。
结语
很多人即使生活中充满重复的事情也不会去探索提高效率方式，因为对比眼前简单的操作，去探究增进效率操作的所花费的学习努力带来的成本更加高，只是把时间线拉得足够远，才能看见效率提升所带来收益。
自动化所存在的意义是帮助人完成任务并节省时间，虽然我们每个人都已经拥有足够多的计算设备，但我们并没有充分发挥其拥有的算力，个人的自动化仍是一个尚待开发的领域。
期待未来的快捷指令能为个人的自动化增添更多的可能性。]]></summary>
