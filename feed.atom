Twitter’s former security chief Peiter “Mudge” Zatko will testify in Congress next month after he went public with damning allegations about the social media company’s security practices and attempts to mislead regulators, the Washington Post reports. Zatko is scheduled to speak at a hearing on September 13th and is expected to address the privacy and national security concerns raised in his complaint.
“Mr. Zatko’s allegations of widespread security failures and foreign state actor interference at Twitter raise serious concerns,” said the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee Senator Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill) and the committee top Republican Senator Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) in a joint statement. “If these claims are accurate, they...

API specification validation is the process of verifying that an API meets all the requirements specified in its documentation. This includes making sure that the API responds correctly to all requests, that it gives back the right data, and that it doesn't give back any data that wasn't expected.
It is an important part of the development process as it ensures that the API behaves as expected and that it meets all the requirements of its users. It is also a good way to catch any errors or bugs in the API before they are released to the public.
API specification validation can be done manually or automatically. By running a series of tests against an API and looking at the results, automated testing tools can make it easier to check if it meets its requiremen…]]></summary>

The Ethereum Foundation has announced that September 6th will be the starting date for the system-wide transition known as the Merge. The first domino will be toppled on the 6th with the activation of the Bellatrix upgrade, which will then set the rest of the Merge process in action, with a completion date expected between September 10th and 20th. 
The Merge refers to the switchover of Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake — two different methods of validating transactions on the blockchain. If you’re not particularly interested in world of crypto, then the technical differences between the two approaches are a little arcane (The Guardian has a good explainer here). But the big upshot is that the new proof-of-stake method will...

Nvidia is getting ready to announce its next-gen GPU architecture, codenamed Lovelace. Ampere is the current GPU architecture that powers Nvidia’s RTX 30-series GPUs, after Turing debuted with the first RTX cards in 2018. Nvidia is now expected to detail its Lovelace GPU architecture at GTC 2022 in September, with CEO Jensen Huang hinting at an announce during the company’s recent earnings call.
“We’ll get through this over the next few months and go into next year with our new architecture,” said Huang, while discussing a slowdown in gaming GPU demand. “I look forward to telling you more about it at GTC next month.”
A new GPU architecture announce doesn’t mean we’ll see RTX 40-series GPUs immediately, though. Nvidia first unveiled its...

Sony is increasing its PS5 prices in the UK, Europe, Japan, China, Australia, Mexico, and Canada. Prices are jumping by 10 percent in Europe, 21 percent in Japan, and by around 6 percent in the UK as inflation rates impact Sony and many other companies. While Sony is increasing PS5 prices in many parts of the world, it says there won’t be a price increase in the US.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[@keyframes are some of the things I use most frequently, so I wanted to build them the way I thought they should be. My goal was to create simple tools that are private, local, customizable, and easy to use, without all the annoying junk like massive ads, popups, invasive tracking, or forced social media integration.


👾 CSS @Keyframe Animation Editor
A tool that gives you a timeline (like movie editing software) to easily create and preview CSS animations. 

❐  Box-Shadow generator
Simply move some sliders to adjust your shadow, add multiple layers, then get the CSS.

🎨 Colors
Create & convert colors, create color palettes, view color contrast and colorblindness, create gradients, and share your palettes.

⌨️ Character codes
Search for and easily copy special character CSS and HTML values.

👋 What makes it stand out:
• It's free - all features. 
• It's private & local - Keyframes only uses Local Storage, and there are no 3rd party trackers or ad networks. It's also open source, so you can verify.
• The UI is customizable - the theme, font, borders, and behaviors like confirmation dialogues and tooltips can be disabled.
• Created from scratch - no frontend frameworks or 3rd-party libraries let me get everything just how I wanted it.


So if you're a developer or designer who works with CSS a lot, I hope these tools can be useful and save you some time. I'll be adding more tools over the coming weeks - so keep an eye out!

I'd love to hear any questions, suggestions, ideas for other tools, criticism, or anything else you have to say!

Observability is the ability to know and interpret the current state of a deployment, and a way to know when something is amiss. With cloud deployments of applications as microservices on Kubernetes and OpenShift growing, observability is getting a lot of attention. Many applications come with strict guarantees, such as service level agreements (SLA) for downtimes, latency, and throughput, so network-level observability is a highly imperative feature. Network-level observability is provided by several orchestrators, either natively or by using plugins and operators.
Recently, eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) emerged as a popular option to…]]></summary>

Starlink, Elon Musk’s internet-from-space service provided by SpaceX, is notifying customers with some good news: their monthly subscriptions have been reduced in response to “local market conditions.”
I received one of these notifications for my Starlink RV service that normally costs me €124 each month in the Netherlands. It says, “Effective 8/24/2022, Starlink is reducing your monthly service fee to €105.” Well, ok.
The price cut is welcome at a time when everything else is getting more expensive due to inflation. “The price reduction factors in your local market conditions and is meant to reflect parity in purchasing power across our customers,” reads the announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spotify 不需要介绍。它是最流行的音乐流媒体服务。




你可以 在 Web 浏览器中播放 Spotify，但如果你经常使用它，使用桌面应用会是一个更好的选择。

为什么呢？因为你可以用媒体键控制播放，得到歌曲的通知，而且不需要担心不小心关闭浏览器标签或窗口。桌面客户端给人一种完整的体验。

Spotify 为 Ubuntu 和 Debian 提供了一个仓库。但在 Arch Linux 上安装 Spotify 呢？

实际上，在 Arch Linux 上获得 Spotify 的桌面应用更加简单。只需使用这个命令：

sudo pacman -Syu spotify-launcher


这就是在基于 Arch 的 Linux 发行版上安装 Spotify 的众多方法之一，如 Manjaro、Endeavour OS、Garuda Linux 等。

在本教程中，我将讨论以下安装 Spotify 的方法：


使用 pacman（你已经在上面看到了，但我们会更深入地挖掘）。

使用 Pamac（Manjaro的软件包管理器）进行安装

使用 Flatpak（通用打包格式）进行安装

使用 Snap（Spotify 团队的官方包）。


方法 1：使用 pacman 安装 Spotify

Spotify 可在 Arch Linux 的社区仓库中 找到。它实际上是 Spotify 提供的 APT 仓库的 Rust 实现。

打开你的终端，按以下方式 使用 pacman 命令：

sudo pacman -Syu spotify-launcher


安装后，从应用菜单中启动它，并登录开始收听。



输入下面的命令，将其连同其依赖关系和配置文件一起删除。

sudo pacman -Rns spotify-launcher


方法 2：使用 Pamac 安装 Spotify

如果你使用 Manjaro 或者 在你的系统中安装了 Pamac，你可以用它来图形化安装 Spotify。

从应用菜单中打开添加/删除软件。点击左上角的搜索图标，搜索 Spotify。然后，选择名为 spotify-launcher 的软件包，并点击应用进行安装，如下图所示。



你也可以在安装后取消选择该软件包，并点击应用来删除它。

使用 Pamac CLI

是的，Pamac 也有一个命令行界面，你可以通过以下方式使用它来获得 Spotify。

pamac install spotify-launcher


要删除，使用：

pamac remove spotify-launcher


方法 3：使用 Flatpak 安装 Spotify

许多用户喜欢使用 Flatpak 安装专有应用，因为它提供了沙盒。

在终端输入以下命令来更新你的系统并安装 Flatpak（如果你还没有）。

sudo pacman -Syu flatpak


然后，使用下面的命令启用 Flathub 仓库。

flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo


现在，通过输入下面的命令安装 Spotify。

flatpak install spotify


要删除 Spotify 的 Flatpak 包，你可以使用下面的命令。

flatpak remove spotify


方法 4：使用 Snap 安装 Spotify

我知道很多人对 Snap 打包格式的“封闭性”非常反感。然而，Spotify 官方提供了一个 Snap 包。你可以从 Spotify 的开发者那里得到它。

如果你的系统支持 Snap 包，请使用以下命令：

sudo snap install spotify


如果你以后想删除它，使用这个命令：

sudo snap remove spotify


总结

第一个方法中讨论的 Arch 包是由 kpcyrd 开发和维护的。你可以在 这里 查看源代码。

如果你喜欢 Arch Linux 并想支持它，请考虑向该项目捐款。所有的工作都是由社区成员完成的，他们是无偿的志愿者。

如果你在 Arch 上安装 Spotify 有任何问题，请告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem: OKRs scoring is misleading

Scoring OKRs is something that sounds great in theory. KRs are on a 0-100% scale (or 0 to 1 if you prefer), and you should be able to look at averages to compare teams together.

But, the issue is that scoring is often misleading:
- Team A can be at 50% of their goals, but failing to grow from there.
- Team B can be at 30% of their goals, and growing rapidly.

☝️ Team A is ahead of Team B in scoring but it is also Team A that's in trouble.

So, how do we fix that?

Solution: use confidence to measure execution

If we ask Team A and B to express their confidence along with the scoring, we'll get the situation below:
- Team A: 50%, at risk (because going flat)
- Team B: 30%, on track (because of exponential growth)

Confidence data is underused today, and we wanted to fix that. So we launched a new metric in Tability that gives you a simple way to measure and compare confidence in achieving goals:

Net Confidence Score = % of goals on-track - % of goals off-track

It's automatically calculated for you, available on your dashboards, and makes it super easy to compare teams together.

Give it a try today! (or adopt it in your spreadsheets!)

(PS: here's a longer blog post about NCS)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[布莱恩·克尼汉在 80 岁的时候还在积极为他的原始项目 AWK 增加代码贡献。这真是鼓舞人心！




布莱恩·克尼汉Brian Kernighan 因其与 Unix 的创造者 肯·汤普森Ken Thompson 和 丹尼斯·里奇Dennis Ritchie 一起的工作而广为人知。他对 Unix 的发展做出了重大贡献。

不仅如此，布莱恩·克尼汉还提出了 “Unix” 这个名字，并创造了 “Hello, world” 作为程序的测试短语。

他也是《C 编程语言》一书的共同作者（另一位是丹尼斯·里奇）。因此，可以说他是你所知道的关于 Unix、Linux、BSD 和 C 编程语言的演变的重要组成部分。

而且，作为一位如今已 80 岁的老人家，他似乎投入了一些时间来为 AWK（一种他在上世纪 70 年代共同创造的脚本语言）增加了一个新的功能。

💙 这真是妙极了，对吗？而且，听起真是鼓舞人心！

注：AWK 仍然是一个处理文本和提取数据的强大工具，忠实于它的最初目的。如果你感到好奇，你可以在 freeCodeCamp 上了解更多关于它的信息。

为 AWK 添加 Unicode 支持

最近，The Register 通过一篇发表在 YouTube 上的近期采访，发现了这个功能的增加。

从技术上讲，这项贡献早在几个月前就有了，但现在它才得到人们的关注。




当然，这个功能的增加对很多人来说可能不是什么大事。但是，它背后的努力，以及谁贡献了它，就有了天壤之别。

此外，有趣的是，他并不完全了解 Git 的工作原理。所以，考虑到这一点，我认为他在这里的提交做得相当好。

在这个提交 “附上 BWK 的邮件 - onetrueawk/awk@9ebe940” 中，他提到：


一旦我搞清楚了（并做了一些检查，我将尝试提交一个拉取请求。我希望我更了解 git，但尽管有你的帮助，我仍然没能正确地理解，所以这可能需要一段时间。


如果你对 Unix 的原始创造者和贡献者以及一路走来的许多重要创新有好奇心，我建议你观看上面链接的采访。

你也可以在 普林斯顿大学网站 上查看他的更多工作和最近的书籍。

💬 那么，你对这位 80 岁的 Unix 传奇人物的代码贡献有何看法？你有什么特别佩服他的地方吗？请在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

Apple’s upcoming iOS 16 update brings with it a lot of new features — things like the ability to customize your Lock Screen, edit iMessages, or copy written text from a video. But Apple’s also made an under-the-radar change to some of the iPhone’s sounds, which some of us here at The Verge noticed while using the betas.
When you go to the Find My app and choose the “play sound” option for an iOS / iPadOS 16 device, you’ll now be greeted with what sounds like an electronic xylophone, instead of the pinging sound that played on iOS 15 and before. The change also applies to when you ask your Apple Watch to ping your phone for you, except the sound plays once instead of over and over. One of my co-workers described the new sound as higher...

As of this writing, there are three videos: one that’s all about the channel, one covering what games Sakurai has worked on (like one of the DS greats, Meteos), and one diving deep about how to use in-game pauses for certain effects (like “hit stop” moments you might see in Smash when landing a punch).

Wordle is now available in The New York Times Crossword app for both iOS and Android users. The addictive guessing game joins both The New York Times Crossword variants, Spelling Bee, and more. Users can also continue to play the game on their desktop and through the mobile website. 
The word-guessing game became an immediate phenomenon after it was released in October 2021. The Times then acquired Wordle from its creator Josh Wardle in January. That decision was not without complaints, as users began speculating that the game had become harder and some of their streaks were ruined. Despite complaints after its acquisition, The Times said that the game allowed The Times to see a jump in new subscribers at its earnings meeting in May and...

I’ve been using the Steam iOS app quite a bit since getting a Steam Deck, but every time I opened the app, I had to deal with an interface that just felt old — the overall design hadn’t been updated in a very long time. It seems Valve felt that way, too, because it’s now beta testing a new version of the app that looks dramatically different and, if you ask me, dramatically better.
In a blog post, Valve mentioned the new design as one of the key new features of the app, and the improvements, at least in my brief testing on iOS, are immediately obvious. For example, the app now has a navigation bar on the bottom of the screen where you can navigate to things like the store, your news feed, and the Steam Guard section.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[@linusgeffarth) and I've been building WikiSpaces on and off last year. But what's this all about?

🥥 in a nutshell
WikiSpaces 3D is about enabling people to go places *virtually*, where they couldn't go otherwise (physically), by providing a collection of such places as 3d-scans, "spaces" 🪐, explorable in VR (yes, also with vr glasses). (3D-scans made with Matterport.)
There are already some really cool spaces: from Boeing 747 cockpits to Egyptian temples or the LeBron James Arena!

🤔 but why?
Mainly, it's about providing educational value and making knowledge accessible: in the times of the COVID-19 pandemic, students are not able to visit interesting places like museums or galleries; but if said place has been 3d-scanned and shared on WikiSpaces, students can visit it virtually.
But it's really about everyone: some of the spaces allow exclusive visits to places you could normally never go to, such as a Boeing 747 cockpit (unless your friend's friend is a pilot of course, ha), or simply places far far away.

💰 really free?
Yes absolutely! Just like Wikipedia aims to share knowledge for free, WikiSpaces does too. Building WikiSpaces has been possible only because the 🇪🇺 EU has provided generous funding (subsidies) for this project.
What about user-submitted content though? All spaces are shared under the CC BY 4.0 license.

👉 what now?
Check out the featured spaces, or scroll down to the explore page and check out a space (or two if you'd like 😝). There are already some really cool spaces, from Boeing 747 cockpits to Egyptian temples or the LeBron James Arena!
And then I'd love it if you could spread the word, share a link, and follow me on twitter @wikispaces3d (I'll be a bit more active there soon 🤞)

❓ Questions? As away! Looking forward to hearing y'all's thoughts! 🙏

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's how it works
There are a couple of things going on inside that search engine, but I'll try to boil it down to simple points.

ℹ️ We collect product info from ProductHunt using their API
🦀 We crawl the internet and look for articles that mention the products from ProductHunt 
👩‍💻 We then extract appropriate keywords that are relevant to the product
📜 We build the index out of keywords that are collected
Note: Our Index size is small, so you might get some irrelevant results. But I've been working hard to scale the index size!

Ranking
I've been experimenting with a couple of ranking ideas but one that I've found to be particularly effective is this

 🗂️ We only consider links that are organic, meaning they aren't paid for or incentivized
  ⬇️ The engine sometimes penalizes the products for some keywords, if it has too many sponsored backlinks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How many tech content do you read and save everyday?

For me: there's articles about DevOps, twitter thread about web dev, docs of Kubernetes… 

I read and saved 20+ resources everyday. 🧐

I tried many tools for archiving resources, but none of them perfectly suit my workflow. So does others in Depths. 🙃

We hate having to tag resources with #Python or #WebDev then manually adding them to folders every single time. Especially when we got like  100+ tabs opening in the same moment. 🤯

That’s where we thought - what if there’s a solution that is:

1️⃣ Simple
2️⃣ Fast
3️⃣ Automated

That’s why we decided to make Depths.

Our goal is to help developers to archive & retrieve knowledge in the easiest way possible. To do this, Depths support:

• Auto-tagging 🔖
• Full-text search 🔍 
• Estimated read time ⏳
• Import your current bookmarks ⬇️
•  … and more for you to explore!

This Alpha version is the first step of our project to make a better bookmark manager for devs. Our goal is to become the best knowledge base tool for devs on the market. 🚀

As a small team of 4 working part-time, user feedback means the world to us. Feel free to try it and let us know what you think of it! 💛

We’ll be here for the next 24 hours to answer your questions. Also you’re very welcome to come to our Discord server to chat with us! https://discord.gg/MSbqnVzB 👋

P.S. If you followed me before, you'll know the previous product I made on is Savvy, which is also a bookmark manager but it didn't have product-market fit. Therefore we spent months on researching and pivoted it into Depths. And I wrote a blog about the entire process :) https://desmond-hth.medium.com/n...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[8 月 23 日，赛昉科技举办 2022 新产品发布会，发布两款重磅新品：全球首款量产高性能 RISC-V 多媒体处理器——昉·惊鸿7110（JH7110），和全球性能最高的量产 RISC-V 单板计算机——昉·星光 2（VisionFive 2），推动 RISC-V 在高性能应用领域渐入佳境。

中国工程院院士倪光南为发布会做开场致辞。倪院士表示，要实现芯片产业自主可控的目标，必须要打破主流 CPU 架构垄断的格局，RISC-V 的出现为推动中国芯片产业发展提供了新的机遇。生态发展是决定 RISC-V 从物联网迈向高性能应用领域的关键，需要社会各界的共同努力。

全球首款量产高性能 RISC-V 多媒体处理器

赛昉科技创始人兼 CEO 徐滔全面揭秘了赛昉科技新一代多媒体处理器——JH7110。作为一款高性能、低功耗、多功能的基于 RISC-V 的应用处理器芯片，JH7110 采用成熟的台积电 28nm 工艺，搭载 64 位高性能四核 RISC-V CPU，工作频率 1.5GHz，2MB 的二级缓存。值得一提的是，JH7110 集成 3D GPU、H.264/H.265 视频编解码 IP 及 ISP IP，是一款功能强大的多媒体处理平台。



根据实测，JH7110 CPU 稳定工作频率达 1.5GHz，Coremark 跑分达到 5.09，是目前市场上 RISC-V 量产芯片中性能最优的产品。此外，JH7110 提供更加强大的 GPU 处理能力，在 400MHz 的 GPU 工作主频下，使用业界标准的 GPU benchmark – GLmark2 测试，相比单板计算机领域应用广泛的主控芯片，JH7110 的实测数据达到其 4 倍以上。

功耗方面，JH7110 被划分为 8 个可独立开关的电源域，CPU 频率可通过软件调节，客户可完全按照应用场景和性能需…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tornado Cash 代码在 GitHub 上重新上传

美国财政部本月早些时候宣布制裁混币器 Tornado Cash，禁止美国个人或组织与 Tornado Cash 有任何交易往来。GitHub 随即下架了该代码库，删除了开发者账号。荷兰还逮捕了一名参与它的开发的开发者。本周，美国约翰霍普金斯大学计算机科学教授 Matthew Green 以教学和研究的目的在 GitHub 上重新上传了 Tornado Cash 代码。电子前哨基金会（EFF）宣布将代表 Green 教授捍卫发布源代码的权利。EFF 称美国宪法第一修正案保护了 GitHub 托管代码的权利，也保护了 Green 教授重新发布代码的权利。


消息来源：EFF



老王点评：这让我想起来当年 PGP 源代码以出版书籍的方式被带出美国的事情。




亚马逊使用为将来保留的 IPv4 240/4 地址段

称之为 E 类地址的 240/4（240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255）被保留供未来使用。但 IPv4 地址资源的稀缺促使 IETF 开始讨论使用这些地址空间。主要操作系统从 2008 年起就支持将 240/4 地址空间作为单播地址使用。调查发现，亚马逊等公司已经在没有和国际互联网机构协调的情况下，在其 AS 内使用 240/4 地址块。


消息来源：RIPE



老王点评：就算是这几亿个 IP 地址释放出来，也很快就会耗尽，所以倒不如像现在这样，当成私有地址使用好了。




美科技巨头收集了大量用户数据，谷歌最多

研究人员分析了谷歌、苹果、Facebook、亚马逊和 Twitter 等主要科技公司收集的用户的大量敏感数据。其中，谷歌从用户那里收集的数据最多，有 39 种。接下来是 Twitter，24 种；亚马逊，23 种；Facebook，14 种。排名最后的是苹果，它收集了 12 种。报告称，“用户没有耐心、时间或精力来发现网站存储了哪些信息，以及如何利用这些信息来获取利益。这意味着，用户通过接受隐私政策，能够让这些公司获取他们所需要的所有信息。”


消息来源：Stock Apps



老王点评：这些商业公司不收集用户隐私反而会是奇怪的事情，所以，现在开始比谁最过分了，不出预料，果然是广告公司谷歌拔的头筹。]]></summary>

前言
很高兴遇见你~
最近我负责的 LiveChat 客服聊天系统到了自研阶段，类似做一个腾讯 IM 通信 SDK。和后台讨论后，确定数据传输方式使用 Protobuf，简单的介绍下自己的一个使用心得
一、Protobuf 介绍
Protobuf 全称：Protocol Buffers，是 Google 推出的一种与平台无关、语言无关、可扩展的轻便高效的序列化数据存储格式，类似于我们常用的 xml 和 json。
问题：既然有了 xml 和 json，Google 为啥还要推出 Protobuf 呢？
存在是有原因的，Protobuf 用两个字总结：小，快。用 Protobuf 序列化后的大小是 json 的十分之一，是 xml 格式的二十分之一，而且性能是他们的 5～100 倍。
通常情况下，我们使用 xml 或者 json 进行数据通信是没什么问题的，但是在高性能和大数据通信的情况下，如果有办法压缩数据量，提高传输效率，显然会给用户带来更快更流畅的体验，因此做 LiveChat 自研，Protobuf 成为我们进行数据传输的第一选择。

互联网上有很多关于 Linux 和开源的信息，但是当你想要深入工作，通常需要一份便捷的文档。早在 Linux 出现之前的 Unix 系统中，就有 man（“manual” 的缩写）和 info 命令了，二者都会显示命令、配置文件、系统调用等的官方项目文档。

关于 man 和 info 页面是对知晓如何使用工具的用户的有用提醒，还是为初次使用的用户提供介绍存在争议。不管怎样，man 和 info 页面介绍了工具以及如何使用该工具，很少涉及特定任务以及如何完成它们。正是出于这个原因，开发了 cheat 命令。

例如，设想你想不起来如何 解压 tar 压缩包文件 。man 页面会给你展示所有的选项，但需要你将这些信息转换为命令：

tar -A [OPTIONS] ARCHIVE ARCHIVE
tar -c [-f ARCHIVE] [OPTIONS] [FILE...]
tar -d [-f ARCHIVE] [OPTIONS] [FILE...]
tar -t [-f ARCHIVE] [OPTIONS] [MEMBER...]
tar -r [-f ARCHIVE] [OPTIONS] [FILE...]
tar -u [-f ARCHIVE] [OPTIONS] [FILE...]
tar -x [-f ARCHIVE] [OPTIONS] [MEMBER...]


这确实是一些用户需要的，但是也使一些用户感到困惑。相比之下，cheat 命令会罗列常用命令：

$ cheat tar

# To extract an uncompressed archive:

Whether attending conferences or reading blogs, I often hear several misconceptions about sudo. Most of these misconceptions focus on security, flexibility, and central management. In this article, I will debunk some of these myths.
Many misconceptions likely arise because users know only the basic functionality of sudo. The sudoers file, by default, has only two rules: The root user, and members of the administrative wheel group, can do practically anything using sudo. There are barely any limits, and optional features are not enabled at all. Even this setup is better than sharing the root password, as you can usually follow who did what on your systems using the logs. However, learnin…]]></summary>

Apache ShardingSphere 5.0.0-Beta version with DistSQL made the project even more beloved by developers and ops teams for its advantages, such as dynamic effects, no restart, and elegant syntax close to standard SQL. With upgrades to 5.0.0 and 5.1.0, the ShardingSphere community has once again added abundant syntax to DistSQL, bringing more practical features.
In this article, the community co-authors will share the latest functions of DistSQL from the perspective of cluster governance.
ShardingSphere clusters
In a typical cluster composed of ShardingSphere-Proxy, there are multiple compute nodes and storage nodes, as shown in the figure below.

前言
MVI并非新兴事物，在2020年时亦曾有通过撰写一篇文章与诸位读者探讨一二的念头。
当时项目采用MVP分层设计，组员的代码风格差异也较大，代码中类职责赋予与封装风格各成一套，随着业务急速膨胀，代码越发混乱。试图用 MVI架构 + 单向流 形成 掣肘 带来一致风格。
但这种做法不够以人为本，最终采用 "在MVP的基础上进行了适当改造+设计约定的方式" 解决了问题，并未将MVI投入到商业项目中，于是 放弃了纸上谈兵。
在半年前终于有机会在商业项目中进行实践，同诸位谈一谈使用后的 个人感悟 ，并藉此讲透MVI等架构。
所有内容将按照以下要点展开：
从架构的理念出发 -- 简单列明各种 MVX 的理念 ， MVX：指代 MVC、MVP、MVVM、MVI
拥抱复杂的同时实现简化 -- 通过对比理解单向数据流动所解决的痛点、设计Intent的原因等问题
单一可信数据源，不可僵化信奉
要想优雅，需要工具 -- 借助声明式、响应式编程工具，构建流，屏蔽命令式编程中的细节，同样是聚焦和简化
状态和事件分家，绝不是吃饱了撑的 -- 为什么要裂变出状态和事件，如何界定
内容会很长，我会酌情再写一些 解 ，结合实例和代码演示内容。
两个项目的基本情况
相比于之前的巨型项目，这两个项目的业务量均不大，一个是基于蓝牙和局域网的操控类APP，下午简称APP-A，一个是内部使用的工具，分析公司各个产品的日志，简称APP-B。
虽然他们的业务深度要比一般的APP要深，但在 本质上一致 ，毕竟同类型业务量再多也仅仅是重复运用一套模式 ，并不影响本质。
和诸多项目的本质一致，均符合如下图所示的逻辑分层，并在人机交互过程中执行业务逻辑：

APP-A 是Android项目，图方便纯kotlin
APP-B 是 Compose-Deskto…]]></summary>

Notion、Obsidian、Logseq、Roam Research、Evernote、flomo、为知、飞书、语雀……知识管理/笔记软件越来越多，我总在不同应用间徘徊。直到有次忽然醒悟，知识管理软件不是管理知识，而是管理笔记。笔记里的知识并不属于你，只有经过消化、应用，才会成为自己的知识。
这么简单的事，我之前却一直没看透，总是把笔记与知识理解划上了等号。当要用到曾摘录的笔记时，就在各类知识管理软件里翻找，折腾一番才找到需要的笔记，有时甚至出现「自己不清楚放在哪里，也不清楚是否有」的情况。记笔记花了一个小时，下次寻找与重新消化又花了一个小时，原本为效率而生的知识管理软件变成了浪费时间的杀手。
另一方面，我们在用知识管理软件的美观界面和强大功能的同时，也被这些软件所限制，无法完全按自己的想法输出笔记。比如，你长了一双翅膀，Markdown 文本是自由的天地，而进入 Notion 则被隔成一个个小房间，你在房间里待着很舒服，可一旦想去其他房间，就必须脱离 block，不比 Markdown 可以自由飞翔。

突破迷思后，我基于 VuePress 和 vuepress-theme-hope 建立了 LearnData 项目，把知识笔记、生活记录、博客和任何觉得有价值的记录转成 Markdown 文本，然后推送到 GitHub 生成 Pages 静态页面，同步到国内云服务器形成 LearnData - 开源学习笔记。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 GNOME 桌面中创建自定义浅色和深色壁纸的简单指南。


GNOME 42 将期待已久的浅色和深色主题引入了 GNOME 桌面。它还带来了浅色和深色版壁纸，当你在浅色和深色主题之间切换时，它会自动改变。

因此，默认情况下，GNOME 会为你提供几组预配置的浅色和深色壁纸。

但是，如果你想要在主题更改时可以自动更改的别的壁纸怎么办？

以下是在 GNOME 中为浅色和深色主题配置和创建自定义壁纸的方法。

如何为 GNOME 创建自定义浅色和深色壁纸

首先，确保有两个版本的壁纸。通常，它们应该是标准的 PNG 或 JPG 图像。例如，我们在演示中使用了以下两个壁纸。



但是，如果你没有合适的浅色和深色壁纸，或正在寻找更多壁纸，在本指南的末尾，我会告诉你如何获取它们或准备你自己的。

跟着我来。

其次，我们需要为自己创建一个模式文件。壁纸的自动更换由名为 adwaita.xml 的 XML 文件处理，该文件定义了特定的浅色和深色背景标签。因此，我们将为壁纸创建 XML 文件。

为此，从 GitLab 复制 adwaita.xml 的内容并创建一个新的 XML 文件（链接在下面）。你应该在这个文件中看到两个标签：filename 和 filename-dark。这两个 XML 标记包含两个壁纸的完全限定路径。在这两个标签下添加图片的路径，如下所示。


从这里下载 XML 文件 (adwaita.xml.in)




第三步，使用你想要的任何名称将此文件保存到 /home/YOUR_NAME/.local/share/gnome-background-properties（请将 YOUR_NAME 替换为你的用户名）。如果 gnome-background-properties 不存在，请创建它们。对此示例，我使用了 my_cool_backgrounds.xml。



都准备好了。最后，打开设置并转到外观选项卡，你应该会看到选项中出现新的壁纸。

选择你的自定义浅色和深色壁纸并享受。



如何下载或制作你的动态壁纸

你一定会想，“谁有时间去寻找和创建深浅版本的壁纸”？一些网站为你提供现成的动态壁纸，你可以轻松下载和安装。

我推荐的一个网站是 dynamicwallpaper.club，它为 macOS 提供了一些高达 6K 的优秀高质量壁纸。你可以轻松下载它们。

此外，如果你打算从上述网站下载，请记住该网站的图像是 heic 格式，因为该网站适用于 macOS。高效视频编码（HEIC）是 Apple 的 HEIF（高效图像文件格式）的专有版本。

你需要一个驱动来查看和转换 Ubuntu 或 Fedora Linux 中的动态 heic 图像。那么，如何将它们转换为适用于 Linux 系统呢？打开终端并运行以下命令来安装驱动。

Ubuntu 用户：

sudo apt install heif-gdk-pixbuf


Fedora 用户：

sudo dnf install libheif


仅适用于带有 KDE Plasma 的 Fedora/Ubuntu（没有此插件，Plasma 应用无法打开 heic 图像）：

sudo apt install qt-heif-image-plugin
sudo dnf install qt-heif-image-plugin


最后，使用你喜欢的图像查看器打开 heic 图像并将其保存为 JPG/PNG。



最后，别忘了在下面的评论部分告诉我你是否可以为 GNOME 创建自定义深色和浅色壁纸。

干杯。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
2022年是新能源车国补的收尾年，随着销量提升，纯电新能源车品牌不断增多，可选性逐渐增大，价格也不断攀升。 

新能源车最完美的使用环境就是有家用充电桩的日常通勤，享受每公里0.05元以下的电费成本，每天到家就能补足电量，即不产生里程焦虑，也极大程度降低出行成本。
早年新能源车标配充电桩，如今随着价格的提高，充电桩成为了重点阉割项目，不说早早就卖8000的特斯拉，今年的小鹏、问界、沃尔沃都不再赠送充电桩，未来越来越多的厂商会加入这一行列。
7KW充电桩或成为未来主流
虽然我个人认为家用申请380V电表，安装21KW充电桩是拓展性最好的极优解，但目前随着环境的改变，未来大部分国人的家充桩都会是220V 7KW的家用桩。 

首先是电网的审批层面，上海地区的国家电网已经于今年停止了380V充电桩电表的新装报批，目前国网只为新能源车主开放220V电表，最大功率7KW的申请渠道。
这是因新能源车增多而出现的必然趋势，国内未来势必会逐渐取消380V电表用于充电。 

第二是对于交流充电而言，家用充电桩是带有保护装置的连接件，充电过程发生于车载充电机，最快交流充电速度由充电机决定，目前国内在售交流充电速率最高的是16KW，搭载在Model S与Model X两台百万级豪车上，一般大众款新能源车，没有这样的高功率电机。 

理想、威马、蔚来、比亚迪、埃安、荣威等主流的新能源车品牌的核心车型，基本都是内置7KW充电机，不支持11KW三相电来交流充电，所以对于很多车主，7KW充电桩已经是顶配了。
最后是7KW交流充电的表现，以谷时点8小时计算，可以为车辆补充56度电，目前市面大部分家用中小型纯电新能源车的能耗在每度电6~7公里，折算一夜谷时可以补电300~350公里，完全可以狠狠开上一整天。
所以，因为政策、热销车辆和7KW充电桩家充综合体验来看，220V 7KW的家充桩或将是未来家庭…]]></summary>

这个需求应该也很少遇到，我就简单记录下，不展开写了。在使用 Material 3 主题的 NavigationBar 时，想在原有效果上，加一条底部横线，是这样的。

正文
在查看文档后，发现 NavigationBar 不支持底部横线效果，但可以设置一个 indicatorShape：
ThemeData defaultThemes({bool useLightMode = true}) {
  return ThemeData(
    colorSchemeSeed: colorOptions[0],
    useMaterial3: true,
    brightness: useLightMode ? Brightness.light : Brightness.dark,
    navigationBarTheme: const NavigationBarThemeData().copyWith(
      height: navigationBarHeight,
      labelTextStyle: MaterialStateProperty.all(
        const TextStyle(fontSize: navigationBarLabelSize),
      ),
      // Add line under the navigationBar as indicator.
      indicatorShape: const RoundedRectangleBorder2(
        height: navigationBarHeight,
        lineColor: navigationBarLineColor,
      ),
    ),
  );
}

默认的这个蓝色圆角矩形指示器，就是系统提供的 RoundedRectangleBorder 类，所以我将它的源码拷贝出来一份，不必改变原有逻辑，只需要在 paint 方法内绘制我们需要的横线即可：
case BorderStyle.none:
  if (null != lineColor && null != height) {
    const double stroke = 4;
    const double padding = 4;
    final Paint paint = Paint()
      ..color = lineColor!
      ..strokeWidth = stroke;
     
    // 要注意 icon + label 是居中显示的.
    // [0, 0] 是在蓝色背景的上边，而不是 navigation bar 的上边.
    // 通过源码可知 [蓝色矩形] 高度：rect.height.
    // [label] 大小是我们通过 labelTextStyle 设置的.
    // 边距 [padding] 默认是 4dp.
    // [height]是我们设置的 navigation bar 高度。
    canvas.drawLine(
        Offset(
          0,
          (rect.height + navigationBarLabelSize + 2 * padding + height!) * 0.5,
        ),
        Offset(
          rect.width,
          (rect.height + navigationBarLabelSize + 2 * padding + height!) * 0.5,
        ),
        paint);
  }

代码就这点，本节完。]]></summary>

本节是在上篇 有固定 header 的底部滑动页效果  功能上的一个小扩展，即当滑动距离超过一半则自动滚至顶部，反之回到底部，来看下效果：
正文
思路也很简单，首先我要知道当前滚动的距离或其占比，DraggableScrollableController 提供了这个能力：
void _draggableScrollListener() {
  // [_currStale] 记录下当前的占比
  // [_controller.size] 即占比, 范围[minChildSize,maxChildSize]
  // [_controller.pixels] 即距离
  if (_currStale != _controller.size) {
    _currStale = _controller.size;
  }
  debugPrint('[listener] size: ${_controller.size}'
      ', pixels : ${_controller.pixels}');
}

其次要知道用户何时停止了滚动，我们可以使用 NotificationListener 来监听 DraggableScrollableSheet 的滚动状态：
NotificationListener<ScrollNotification>(
  onNotification: (ScrollNotification notification) {
    ...
    return false;
  },
child: DraggableScrollableSheet(...),

之后在用户停止滚动的时候，我们判断当前距离，并根据结果让 DraggableScrollableSheet 自动滚动到顶部或底部。

一位开发者发帖称，他想要修改汽车上的车载信息娱乐系统，他的汽车是现代公司 2021 款的“全新未来移动生活概念的电动汽车 IONIQ”。在试图找出如何为汽车更新定制固件时发现，其中用来为某些部分签名的 RSA 公钥可以在网上搜索找到。更离谱的是，正如这位开发者说的，“如果运气好的话，他们不仅留下了公钥，还留下了私钥”，它是一个常见的密钥对，出现在“使用 OpenSSL 进行 RSA 加密和解密的 C 语言示例”之类的在线教程中，在这些教程中列出了使用的示例公钥和私钥。现代公司对此没有置评。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这可真是按照教程来的，连示例的密钥对都一起学习了。




AI 被用于通过监控视频中的行人步态识别和分类行人

据报道，马里兰大学的一个明星教授研究团队在资金的支持下，开发了一种城市监控软件，可以根据行人的独特步态特征来识别他们。然后，该算法将使用这些步态特征将行人分为“好斗”、“害羞”、“冲动”和其他性格。“这些能力将被用来预测每个行人的行为，对监视很有用”。他们在赞助方提供的视频上进行了测试，并提供了该软件的 C++ 代码库和原始数据集作为交付品。该团队还进行了“模拟大规模异质人群的有效计算模型”等类似研究。这一研究引发了对“关于机器学习研究中的严重道德问题”的关注。

苹果公司的服务成为其收入的重要来源

迄今为止，苹果公司已将 18 亿台设备装入世界上一些最富裕的消费者的口袋和办公桌上。现在，它正在向其他公司出售这些客户的使用权，并说服那些拥有其设备的人注册自己的订阅服务。去年，苹果的服务带来了 680 亿美元的收入，占苹果总收入的 19%。在最近一个季度，服务收入的份额甚至高达 24%。据估计，最大的一块是来自其应用商店的费用，去年的费用可能达到 250 亿美元。其次是谷歌为 iOS 中的默认搜索引擎付出的费用，2020 年付出了 100 亿美元，据估计现在接近 200 亿美元。而其广告服务今年估计是 70 亿美元。剩下的是一系列订阅服务：iCloud 存储、苹果音乐和苹果护理保险等等。

前言
在上一篇文章中，我们说到打算使用 compose 实现一个计算器 APP，最开始打算做一个经典的 LCD 基础计算器，后来觉得好像没啥特色，最终决定还是改成仿微软计算器。
不过，微软计算器的功能太多了，仿制的工程量不小，所以我打算只仿我认为最核心的两个模式：标准模式和程序员模式。
另外，这篇文章只说 UI 实现，具体的运算逻辑可以自行查看源码。
功能特性
是否支持
功能




✔
基础四则运算（标准、程序员）


✔
无限输入（标准）


✔
% , 1/x , x² , √x 扩展运算（标准）


✔
运算过程历史记录（标准）


✔
二进制、八进制、十进制、十六进制随意切换并实时换算（程序员）


✔
位运算：左移、右移（程序员）


✔
逻辑运算：AND、OR、NOT、XOR（程序员）


✔
无限连续计算（标准、程序员）


✔
支持悬浮窗计算器，可调整位置、大小、透明度（标准）


✔
符合人体握持习惯的横屏键盘


✔
旋转手机自动切换标准和程序员键盘


✔
深色模式


✔
酷炫的数字动效与振动反馈



注意：
标准模式使用 BigDecimal 计算，所以理论支持无限位数数字计算
程序员模式因为涉及到二进制计算，所以采用 64 位储存大小，故不支持无限位数计算
程序员模式不支持带小数运算，如果运算结果有小数，则会直接抛弃小数部分

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[红帽在宣布将工作重心从 CentOS 切换到 CentOS Stream 后，CentOS 的定位发生了变化。按照 CentOS 官方的说法，它从原来的 RHEL 下游项目变成了一个 Linux 开发平台，社区开发者可以与红帽的开发人员一起为 RHEL 做贡献。如果单纯的从字面上的意思来看，很容易让人理解为 CentOS Stream 就是红帽的开发测试版本，既然是开发和测试的版本，所以不稳定就是必然的。

那么实际情况是什么？

把一个大家可以免费使用的发行版变成了不稳定的开发版本，红帽真的这么不厚道么？我一直想写点东西来以正视听，直到我看到了 Stef Walter（他是红帽雇员，高级总监，软件工程（全球）。负责 RHEL 和 Satellite 的大部分工作：服务、应用堆栈、安装、升级、镜像构建等等）的博文《CentOS Stream 是持续交付的》，我知道我不需要写任何东西了，只需将它翻译成中文就已足够。为了方便大家理解，在原文译文的基础上，我加了很多注释。

通过这篇译文，我们可以找到下面问题的答案：


红帽为什么要做这个转变？

红帽的开发模式发生了哪些变化？

Stream和RHEL的异同在哪里？

Stream稳定么？


持续交付 101：持续做苦难的事情，它们就会变得容易！

从外界看来，我们构建 RHEL（包括 CentOS Linux）的方式十多年来似乎没有什么变化。但在幕后，我们正在进行一场巨大的改革，即如何在不影响客户的情况下开发 RHEL。

我在很多的会议上讲述过这个故事，但有关 CentOS Linux 8 和 CentOS Stream 的公告推动了我在这里讲述这个故事。

三年前（原文发布于 2020 年，因此这里是 2017 年），我们几个在 RHEL 工程部工作的人有了一个想法：如果我们将现代化的开发实践…]]></summary>

NetworkManager was introduced in 2004 to make network configuration more flexible and dynamic. The old SystemV startup shell scripts, of which the interface configuration files were a part, were incapable of handling WiFi, wired, VPNs, broadband modems, and more—or at least incapable of doing it quickly or efficiently.
In a series of articles, I've written about why I'm a fan of NetworkManager and how I've used it. In part 1, I looked at what NetworkManager does and some of the tools it provides for viewing network connections and devices. In that article, I mentioned that NetworkManager does not need interface configuration files for most hosts. Howe…]]></summary>

LaTeX 文件准备系统有一段有趣的历史。在 1968 年，程序员 Don Knuth 用一种老式印刷排版方式，撰写了他的第一本书《计算机程序设计艺术The Art of Computer Programming》。当他在 1976 年出版第二版时，出版商已经转向现代照相排版技术。

Knuth 对新版本的外观不满意。他从程序员的角度解决问题，决定创建他自己的文字处理系统，这样以后他出版的书就可以以相同格式排版，拥有相同的外观。因此，Don Knuth 在 1978 年编写了第一版 TeX 。

几年后，Leslie Lamport 创建了一组宏定义，以便作者更容易编写复杂文档。Lamport 的宏定义扩展，即 LaTeX，有效地扩展了 TeX 能够轻松创建各种文档。例如，许多学术组织使用 LaTeX 出版期刊和论文集。

前言
最近有一个小需求：图表支持局部显示，如下底部的区域选择器支持
左右拖动调节中间区域
拖拽中间区域，可以进行移动
图表数据根据中间区域的占比进行显示部分数据

这样当图表的数据量过大，不宜全部展示时，可选择的局部展示就是个不错的解决方案。由于一般的图表库没有提供该功能，这里自己通过绘制来实现以下，操作效果如下所示：

1. 使用 chart_range_selector
目前这个范围选择器已经发布到 pub 上了，名字是 chart_range_selector。大家可以通过依赖进行添加
dependencies:
  chart_range_selector: ^1.0.0

这个库本身是作为独立 UI 组件存在的，在拖拽过程中改变区域范围时，会触发回调。使用者可以通过监听来获取当前区域的范围。这里的区域起止是以分率的形式给出的，也就是最左侧是 0 最右侧是 1 。如下的区域范围是 0.26 ~ 0.72 。

ChartRangeSelector(
  height: 30,
  initStart: 0.4,
  initEnd: 0.6,
  onChartRangeChange: _onChartRangeChange,
),

void _onChartRangeChange(double start, double end) {
  print("start:$start, end:$end");
}

封装的组件名为： ChartRangeSelector ，提供了如下的一些配置参数：

前言
测算函数/方法执行耗时，对于每一位开发同学来说，似乎都是一道绕不过的坎，几乎都曾经历过。也许你会使用下面这种方式：

这种方法高效、成本低。但如果发散到测算成千上百个函数/方法执行耗时的时候，显然这并不是一个好办法。那么在iOS开发中有什么好方案吗？经过一番研究探索，我们实现了一套基于汇编hook objc_msgSend进行方法耗时计算的方案，开源地址见 ->https://github.com/HuolalaTech/hll-wp-guldan-ios<-。 接下来，带大家走进本文。
在开始之前，我们做以下约定：
本文中的 OC 指代 Objective C，ARM 指代 ARM 64。
背景
货拉拉移动端各条业务线产品，在每一次版本发布前，都会经过严格的各项性能测试，其中有一项启动性能测试，背后使用的是淘宝开源的tidevice工具（本质与libimobiledevice类似）。但这种性能测试处于流水线中末端，也有一定的分析成本。我们总结痛点如下：
定位难，责任划分不清；
方法耗时问题比较难以定位，不能定位到业务所在的位置，也就容易出现归属和责任不清的尴尬境遇；
动作滞后，影响发布；
启动性能测试处于流水线中末端，比较滞后，如果发现修复影响面比较大的问题，可能会影响版本发布；
工时长，不可持续；
Xcode Instruments虽然可以在开发时使用，但使用时间比较长，分析结果难以持续，近似属于消费完便丢掉的状态。
我们的目标是：
低成本：接入方低成本接入；
无侵入：不侵入业务；
高性能：性能足够高；
可视化：分析结果可视化；
探索
站在巨人的肩膀上
在梳理完需求之后，值得做的第一件事便是翻阅前人在该领域的探索和实践过程中所积累下来的资料。站在巨人…]]></summary>

作为一个法学生，我的日常生活主要围绕在上课、论文、实习以及我杂七杂八的爱好上。今天在这里跟大家聊一聊我是如果进行任务管理的。
我的任务管理系统
软件的选择
从2017年接触滴答清单以来，滴答清单变得功能越来越丰富。熟悉这款软件的人都知道，如今的滴答清单已经不单单是一款Todo  List软件了，而是一款融合日历、笔记、清单、习惯打卡、番茄钟的“综合性”软件。
我相信大多数的“少数派”们都是“Less is more”的坚实簇拥者，看到现在的滴答清单一定也会和我一样不自觉的想起国产的印象笔记，觉得这是一款什么都做却又什么都做不好的软件。因此从2017年接触这款软件后，我很快又转向了Things、Omnifocus、Todoist、Anydo、2Do、微软Todo、Reminder……
不夸张的说，从2016年接触GTD概念后的我，基本用过市面上各式各样的GTD软件，但是时隔多年，2016年的我刚刚进入大学，如今的我研究生也已经快要毕业了，在经历过不同环境下各种工作流的转换，兜兜转转我还是回到了滴答清单，原因无他，唯性价比高、满足我的需求、稳定矣。
化繁为简
虽然现在的滴答清单功能复杂，但好在这款软件还是给我们“Less is more”的选择，即仅选择我们用得到的功能，隐藏那些我们用不到的功能
滴答清单的功能模块隐藏
就我个人而言，我把滴答清单仅作为我的Todo List和日历，因此也就只选择了这两个功能模块。除了能够隐藏部分“功能”，在滴答清单里，还能够做到隐藏“视图”、“标签”等，将“Less is more”的观点贯彻到底，对于显示什么，不显示什么给了我们非常大的自主权。

下面我就来讲讲我具体是怎样使用滴答清单来处理我的日常生活的。

不吹不黑，LeakCanary 源码中除了实现内存泄漏的监控方案外，还有非常多值得学习的编程技巧，只有沉下心去阅读的人才能够真正体会到。在这篇文章里，我将带你从入门开始掌握 LeakCanary 的使用场景以及使用方法，再介绍 LeakCanary 的工作流程和高级用法，最后通过源码解析深入理解原理。本文示例程序已上传到 Github： DemoHall · HelloLeakCanary ，有用请给 Star 支持，谢谢。
提示： 本文源码分析基于 2022 年 4 月发布的 LeakCanary 2.9.1。
本文原理分析涉及的 Java 虚拟机内存管理基础：
1、垃圾回收机制
2、引用机制：说一下 Java 的四种引用类型
3、Finalizer 机制：为什么 finalize() 方法只会执行一次
本文源码分析涉及的 Android 原理基础：
1、Jetpack · App Startup：轻量级初始化框架
2、Jetpack · Fragment：模块化的微型 Activity

在上篇文章 深入浅出 Retrofit 中，就是通过 动态代理 来实现具体的网络请求逻辑。本着刨根究底的原则，这篇文章来探究一下动态代理的技术原理。
静态代理
在这之前，先来看一下基础的 静态代理 。
接口类 ICount 和实现类 Counter ：
public interface ICount {
    void test1();
    void test2();
}
​
public class Counter implements ICount {
​
    @Override
    public void test1() {
        System.out.println("test1");
    }
​
    @Override
    public void test2() {
        System.out.println("test2");
    }
}

现在要加一个需求，统计 Counter 类中每个方法的耗时。本着开闭原则，对扩展开放，对修改关闭，最好不要去动 Counter 原本的逻辑，可以提供一个同样实现 ICount 的代理类 CounterProxy ：
public class CounterProxy implements ICount {
​
    private Counter counter;
​
    public CounterProxy(Counter counter) {
        this.counter = counter;
    }

我们先来实现点击切换，后面再来实现滑动切换，checked状态是需要外面(ViewModel)传过来，同样onCheckedChange回调的状态，需要同步更新到ViewModel中。
我们来简单的看看，只实现，点击切换按钮状态的效果代码：
// 定义按钮点击的状态记录

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[越来越受欢迎的白板工具
最近几年市面上出现了很多白板工具应用，白板顾名思义就是在手机、平板、或者电脑上模拟现实生活中白板的应用。
白板应用从产品设计的角度来讲及其简单，因为白板应用的的概念模型足够简单——就是一张白纸、或者办公室放着的一块白板。
如果仅从概念模型上来看，白板应用似乎没啥可做的，你只需要写一个白板，然后做一个手写功能就可以了。
那么为什么市面上还是有那么多的白板应用呢？以及决定一款白板应用好不好用，我们是不是有什么样的评价标准呢？
对于这个问题，我想说的是，在保证使用体验的前提下，工具产品本身是没有好坏之分的，评判一款工具产品好不好其实没有意义，工具产品只能基于你的使用场景，评判适不适合。所以基于这个逻辑，我使用一个框架对市面上的白板应用进行了一个简单的分类。

 
在纵向，我根据使用场景来进行划分，就是你使用白板更多的时候是个人使用，还是需要和别人协作？
在横坐标上，我使用白板本身的功能性来进行划分，目前市面上的白板应用在功能性层面主要分为两类，第一类主打真实书写体验，无限书写区域，完全书写自由度，第二类则主打提供模块化的组件，弱化书写体验，强化沟通模版的白板应用。
从这种分类方式可以发现，其实个人的更偏向于自由度高的，而协作的更偏向于模块化的，为什么呢？
因为这和实际的工作场景是匹配的，个人使用白板，无论怎么发散书写，书写的信息的上下文都在个人脑中。但如果是协作场景的话，沟通的效率就变得至关重要，所以一些通用的，模块化的，标准化的沟通方法可以让所有对一个事情的认知都对齐，这种方法本质上是弱化了个人化的表达方式，用更标准的沟通方式来提升沟通效率。
也许以上分类方法并不是一定合理，但就目前我自己用起来是OK的。
在聊具体的白板应用之前我想，先聊一个问题。
为什么白板这么好用？

你或多或少还能想起一些公号大V，还有以前在朋友圈刷屏的文章，那些高光时刻像浮雕一样刻在脑海，好像见证着这个平台的兴衰浮沉。
今天不考古，也不讲宏大叙事，想从个人的视角，跟你分享下我与公众号的一些故事。

我第一次知道公众号是2013年，那是大一下学期，我也刚注册微信。
彼时微博正兴，因在校园杂志上看到「糗事大百科」博主赵诚玩微博年入千万，颠覆认知，第一次看到上学-工作之外的道路。
我能不能呢？不知道，但想试试。
寒假买了第一台笔记本电脑，从此没日没夜沉浸在微博里，研究怎么涨粉、互推、发段子。
做搞笑内容半年时间，小有成就，到了5万多粉丝（没买粉），偶有广告投放赚点零花钱，我对微博的发展充满信心。
注册微信后了解到公众号，那会儿我对它是不屑一顾的，长内容、排版难看、一天就发一条、没互动，怎么看都没出路。而微博不一样，信息流、用户停留时间长、话题多、互动丰富、140字段子&新闻、搞笑动图，人们更喜欢，这才是媒介发展的下一个方向。
公众号就像上个时代的博客，现在无非迁移到移动端，换汤不换药。
谁愿意拿着手机看长文呢？
2014年，我给学校一家饰品玩具店出营销主意，老板问我要不要做公众号，我坚决说不要做，耽误精力、不能实时传达，还得引导关注，太麻烦，不如加微信好友送小礼品，然后朋友圈发优惠活动。人们不看公众号，但肯定刷朋友圈，触达率更高（没想到那会儿就有私域流量的理念了）。
转变是在大二下学期，微博起色不大，发送频率高又耽误学习，而且一直发搞笑段子觉得没意义，就把号卖了。
于此同时，公众号很多优质内容开始出现，好多大V也倾向长文、深度观点输出，即便是搞笑段子，质量也比微博高一个层次。自己开始沉迷每日阅读公号，朋友圈也经常有刷屏文章，同学讨论的也是XX文章的观点，仿佛突…]]></summary>

为何使用 MVI
MVI 是一响应式模型，通过唯一入口入参，并从唯一出口接收结果和完成响应。
换言之，通过将 States 聚合于 MVI-Model，页面根据回传结果统一完成 UI 渲染，可确保
所获 States 总是最新且来源可靠唯一
可消除 mutable 样板代码
“消除样板代码” 相信开发者深有体会。“所获 States 总是最新且来源可靠唯一”，对此存疑，故我们继续一探究竟。
MVI 原始理论模型
根据网传 MVI 理论模型，经典 MVI 模型伪代码示例如下：

  val btnChecked: Boolean,
  val title: String,

Many developers struggle with work-life balance. They are overloaded with regular tasks and frequently called upon to solve urgent customer issues. Yet many developers, like me, have ideas they want to promote if only they had time to do so. Sometimes these pet ideas do not make it through the product management feature-selection process. Other times, a developer does not have time to complete the solution end-to-end on their own, yet they know if it could somehow be implemented, the project would benefit.
This is where mentoring comes in. Mentorship has many benefits: It helps the mentee's personal development, and it can improve the mentor's self-confidence an…]]></summary>

首先解释一下这个「第二份」是什么意思。我通常喜欢把在大四校招时使用的简历称作「第一份简历」，因为那是你踏入社会的第一步，是你第一次将自己的经历通过简历来展示。往后跳槽、换工作使用的简历都可以称作「第二份」，它代表着你已经是一个成熟的社会人，有足够的社会、工作经验。
那么就让我们先回看一下「第一份简历」我们都会写一些什么。我们在写校招简历的时候，通常会涉及到的内容为以下几点。

专业课分数 / 绩点
奖惩情况
兼职情况
在校期间参与的项目（可以是学校的实验，也可以是兼职参与的项目）
在校期间所任职务

这五点足够展现你在大学四年的能力，让校招企业充分了解你。因为能够参与校招的企业，都知道你不会有正式的工作经历，自然也没参与过社会上的工作项目。企业人事对参与校招的学生大多抱着「该生是否有培养空间」的态度来面对。因此在写校招简历的时候上面五点只需要充分体现你的潜力就足以吸引到大部分校招企业。
来到「第二份简历」，这个时候你面对的 HR ，不再会把你当作初出茅庐的应届毕业生，而是一个有着社会工作经验的求职者。HR 对求职者的要求也非常简单明了，即「你是否能为公司创造价值」。这个「价值」可以是短期内的，也可以是长远角度的，具体看 HR 怎么定位你的职位。但是有一点是不变的，那就是上面提到的，你不再是学生，你只是「求职者」。
如何写「第二份简历」
「第二份简历」相比「第一份简历」，会有不少内容上的变化。首先是不再着重于在校情况的描写，而是着墨于当前或者上段工作经历的一个梳理与细致归纳。不要简单概括，而是要将内容详细写出来。同时，在现公司或者前公司所做的项目，也要有个清晰的描写。
工作经历

让我们先来看看这份简历。这是少数派员工 @三点一四 的个人简历，也是现在许多求职者非常典型的一种简历。在工作经历中「工作职责」这一栏有两个条目，一个是「监督员工工作状…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近我们发布了一款全新的笔记产品——Neatfiy。（https://neatifyapp.com/）
正如其名，Neat（整洁）ify（化），Neatify 的初衷是编辑整洁清晰的结构化笔记，比起很快速的随手记备忘录，它适用于知识的管理、周期性的写作总结...之类的场景。
如左图
在大约去年年底的时候，我们立下了一个 Flag——我们要将专注笔记进行一次重构。 Neatify 就是我们拿出来的结果。下面不简单地聊一下，我们在这个路上的一些思考，以及集中回答一些朋友提出的疑问：

很多人对于 Neatify 的第一个疑问，就是为什么我们团队要出两款很相似的两款产品？

专注笔记，是我们第一款推出的笔记软件。也是我们团队首次接触「笔记」软件的开始，虽然我们自己也很喜欢专注笔记，它有很多很有用的功能及体验，比如结构化的目录、清晰的标注阅读体验。
但确实我们是第一次做笔记软件，前期很多没想清楚的地方，因此做了很多没什么用、甚至很负面的一些设计。这些是一些很沉重的历史包袱。如果我们还背着沉重的历史包袱，我们在优化的过程中就显得被束缚住了。
很显然的是，我们在这三年多的积累里，最重要的不是我们写过了什么代码，而是积累了很多很多的经验。所以我们这次，希望是抛开一切已有的东西，去构思一款自己心目中最理想的笔记产品应该是怎样的。这就是 Neatify。
在 Neatfiy 上面，我们并没有很刻意地去增加很多的功能，来让它看上去有很明显被“改版升级”的感觉，甚至做了很多的减法，比如：
1、把笔记本、子页面等层级都砍了，只保留文件夹 → 页面这样的结构，因为在使用专注笔记的时候，我们总在纠结，这样的层级关系，我们应该使用笔记本呢？还是子页面呢？还是文件夹呢？它们之间的作用太相似了，在每次使用的时候都要思考很久，这是意见很“反效率”的事情。
2、把很多花里胡哨的功能去了，比如各种各样的视图啊之类…]]></summary>

登录拦截系列：
登录拦截-AOP的实现
登录拦截-方法池和消息回调的实现
登录拦截-线程的实现
登录拦截-协程的实现
登录拦截-Intent的实现
登录拦截-动态代理Hook的实现
登录拦截-拦截器模式的实现
前言
前面的一篇文章我们讲到了Intent原始的方法，虽然使用起来很麻烦但是还是能实现效果的，那有没有简便一点的封装？
有的，其实就和本篇的标题一样，早前网上还有这样的一种方案，使用动态代理+Hook的方式，替换启动Activity的对象，把全部的startActivity都拦截掉，替换掉我们自定义的Activiy。
如果都写死了所有的Activity跳转都写到一个拦截中，我们又如何实现拦截登录的功能呢？
我们整理一下思路：
我们需要先使用动态代理+Hook的方式替换全部的Activity启动。
我们在动态代理的回调中我们需要拿到原始的Intent，内部判断是否已经登录
如果已经登录，我们需要放行，直接执行原始的Intent方法。
如果没有登录，我们需要拦截，替换掉原始的Intentn，跳转到我们指定的Intent - LoginActivity的跳转。
那如何实现登录完成继续意图呢？还是和前面的文章一样，还是把之前的inent当参数传递给LoginActivity，然后让LoginActivity帮我们执行之前的Intent。
接下来我们一步一步来实现这个方案。
一、动态代理 + Hook 的实现
在之前的文章我们讲过插件化的实现有点类似，插件化一般是替换系统的 mInstrumentation 为自己的 Instrumentation 。
而我们这里没有这么麻烦，我们这里需要Hook的是ASM ，是A…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
NestedScrolling是Android推出的一套嵌套滑动机制，能够让父View和子View在滑动时相互协调配合可以实现连贯的嵌套滑动，它基于原有的事件分发机制上为ViewGroup和View增加处理滑动的方法调用。本文从基本NestedScrolling机制的基本原理出发，详细介绍了如何利用NestScrolling机制实现LOFTER新版个人主页嵌套滑动效果。
1.效果预览
LOFTER 7.1.0版本需求，个人主页要实现以下嵌套滑动效果：

2.技术方案选型
需求上需要实现父布局优先滑动、滑动到某个时机子布局开始滑动，然后子布局滑动到一定距离能够吸顶，而且子布局需要支持完全滑出页面等交互效果，这种效果通常使用coordinatorlayout + appbarlayout + viewpager实现， 初步尝试发现不能完全满足视觉的效果需求，比如下拉滑走、下拉回弹这种效果不能简单实现，若要实现需要很多hook的配置方式，不好扩展及维护，最终选择利用嵌套滑动的基本原理实现了一套适合我们自己业务场景的嵌套滑动控件，能够适配更多的个性化滑动的场景需求。
3.嵌套滑动的基本原理
传统的嵌套滑动处理从事件分发的角度出发，有以下两种处理方法：
3.1 外部拦截法
外部通过调用onInterceptTouchEvent方法决定自己是否消费该事件
3.2  内部拦截法
内部通过父类的requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent告诉外部是否要拦截事件
在传统的触摸事件分发中，如果不手动调用分发事件或者去发出事件，外部View最先拿到触摸事件，一旦它被外部View拦截消费了，内部View无法接收到触摸事件，同理，内部View消费了触摸事件，外部View也没有机会响应触摸事件。
而接下介绍的NestedScrolling机制，在一次滑动事件中外部View…]]></summary>

前言
flutter项目中，在页面数据较多的情况下使用全量刷新对性能消耗较大且容易出现短暂白屏的现象，出于性能和用户体验方面的考虑我们经常会使用局部刷新代替全量刷新进行页面更新操作。
GlobalKey、ValueNotifier和StreamBuilder等技术方案都可以实现Flutter页面的局部刷新，本文主要记录的是通过StatefulBuilder组件来实现局部刷新的方法。
页面的全量刷新
在StatefulWidget内直接调用setState方法更新数据时，会导致页面重新执行build方法，使得页面被全量刷新。
我们可以通过以下案例了解页面的刷新情况：
 int a = 0;
 int b = 0;
 ​
 @override
 Widget build(BuildContext context) {
   return Scaffold(
     body: Center(
       child: Column(
         mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
         children: [
           // 点击按钮，数据‘a’加1，并刷新页面
           ElevatedButton(
             onPressed: () {
               a++;
               setState(() {});
             },
             child: Text('a : $a'),

【写作能力提升】系列文章：
为什么建议你一定要学会写作?
“5种搭建⽂章架构的⽅法”免费赠送!
写作小白需要避免的五个写作误区和灵魂五问
一、前言
Hello，我是小木箱，今天主要分享的内容是: 5种搭建⽂章架构的⽅法!
大家普遍有一个共同的疑惑——如何写作? 其实是一个很难回答的问题。因为问题比较空泛，好比别人问你怎样赚钱一样难回答。
如果问我如何写好一篇文章?需要具备的核心的技能是什么？我可能会说: 搭建框架，框架是文章的根基，能不能搭好文章的框架决定了文章的质量。
想要写好一篇文章，最先要做的便是搭建文章框架。为什么这么说呢？因为如果写文章不搭建框架，那么写作会出现以下三种情况。
二、三种情况
2.1 第⼀种情况:写着写着思路断了
第一种情况: 写着写着思路断了 ，断了也不要紧，接不回来了才尴尬。刚刚明明想得很清楚，上了个厕所，就忘了接下来应该怎么写了。
2.2 第⼆种情况:写着写着就跑题了
第二种情况: 写着写着就跑题了，写得很嗨，写得很快。一顿操作猛如虎，行云流水 30000 字，写完一看，完了，跑题了，BBQ了。
2.3 第三种情况:逻辑处理不够严谨
第三种情况: 思路也没断，也没跑题，逻辑处理的不太严谨，大大影响了内容的质量。
三、搭建文章框架
这三种情况是因为没有搭建文章框架导致的。框架是写文章时的指路灯。这条指路灯是你的逻辑。它确保你的内容不会冲出跑道，第一读者读起来没有压力，第二写的时候会更容易，所以说搭建文章框架是写作最关键的一步，那怎么搭建文章框架呢？我总结了五种搭建文章框架的方法。
3.1 时间的顺序
第一种，按照时间的顺序布局，在自媒体写作中，第一种常见的逻辑顺序是: 按照时间的顺序来写时间自带的逻辑，从昨天到今天，从今天到明天，这是时间逻辑；年终总结，从年初到年中，从年中到年终，这是时…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[上一讲“猛药”过去，功效性的讲解就要小小告一段落了。在护肤金字塔的第二层，只剩下了“修护”这个话题，而在金字塔的顶端，“再生”我们还有没有提到。修护与再生，代表了皮肤自身的规律，修护受损的细胞，代谢老去的废物，同时刺激新的牺牲生成。修护和再生在一门交叉学科，很难把他们分开。那么就从这里开始，让我们看看修护和再生的秘诀。
什么是修护与再生
我们的皮肤，每天都冲在第一线，帮助我们抵御外界的侵袭，所以皮肤每天都在“受伤”，修护，就是要让我们的皮肤屏障更坚挺，保证皮肤能够处于正常的工作状态。
但修护并不等同于“包扎伤口”，不是只有当皮肤已经明显受损以后才需要修护，而更像是增强免疫力，需要从日常下手，维护皮肤的健康状态。所以，修护既是我们大妈们锻炼身体的广场舞，也是医生关键时刻可以救命的手术刀。
而再生，依赖于修护，又高于修护。修护的目的就是让皮肤获得健康稳定的状态，从而促使其再生，再生依赖于修护提供好的基础，同时又在修护的基础上提供和创造新生。
修护与再生的场景
不同的情况下，我们所选择的修护方法、成分、产品也不尽相同。
日常修护
大多数时候，我们需要的都只是日常的修护，目的是让白天工作了一天的皮肤得到舒缓和放松，类似于我们每晚的睡眠，是为了让皮肤可以继续保持一个健康稳定的状态。这种情况下，并不需要使用什么猛药，只需要选择皮肤容易吸收的，温和的产品，就可以达到我们的要求。这时修护的关键词是：温和。
晒后紧急修护
紫外线对皮肤的伤害，在防晒的一讲中已经充分解读（忘记了，可以回看这里），但有时候我们难免遇到极端天气，或者一时犯懒，防晒做的不好，导致皮肤被晒伤。这时皮肤往往处于一个非常脆弱的状态，继续急速有效的镇定，来帮助皮肤迅速回到相对稳定的状态。这时修护的关键词是：极速。
过敏修护
对于敏感肌同学，经常需要面对的就是解决自己的过敏问题，当皮肤受到一些并不耐受的刺激，就会激发皮肤的自我…]]></summary>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。 

进度条是个好东西，在日常的工作生活中，总会有一些场景是它能大展身手的。
做项目管理时，我们能通过一个里程碑的进度条，了解其下多个任务的整体进度；做预算管理时，设置好每个类别的预算上限，进度条就能告诉我们各个类别下的预算使用情况；测评打分时，进度条也能直观展示各评分项之下，打分对象的得分情况（比如餐厅的口味、环境、服务），方便我们对比绝对值、相对值。
如果你是一名 Notion 的资深用户，可能已经早早的在 Notion 数据库中用上了进度条，但你可能不知道，Notion 最近的一项更新，让进度条对 Notion 新手变得更低门槛、触手可及了。
在这篇 Notion 进度条教程中，我将围绕此次更新的进度条功能，介绍这 4 点内容：

Notion 新推出的进度条功能
相比原有方案，新的进度条好在哪
哪些地方可以使用新进度条
如何设置进度条

希望通过这篇文章，能帮助你更好的使用 Notion、释放自己的生产力。
原生支持的新进度条
大约 4 天前，Notion 官方发布了一条推文，宣布为进度条增加了原生支持。

从原推文的动图中可见，在 Notion 的数据库中，可以根据给定的属性值生成进度条图形，并紧邻数字显示，目前有条形（Bar）、环形（Ring）这两种可选样式：
Notion 官推里，用动图演示了进度条的设置操作
我也在自己的数据库中尝试了这两种样式，数字阅读起来确实会更直观一些。

前言
关于App实现登录的拦截再执行逻辑，我已经出了几篇方案了，有些同学可能会问，你整的一些花里胡哨的有啥用，原生的Intent就能实现这些功能,我都是这么用的。
其实也没错，其实我之前也是这么使用Intent用的，应该算是比较基本的用法。下面一起看看基于Intent怎么实现登录拦截，又有哪些实现的方式？好不好用呢？
一、ResultApi
最基本的用法就是 startActivityForResult onActivityResult ，当然这一种方案已经Out了，谷歌也推荐我们使用Result Api，关于这一点后期会单独讲，这里还是以 onActivityResult 为例子。
     //Intent的方式
        mBtnProfile2.click {

            if (!LoginManager.isLogin()) {
                gotoLoginPage()

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
理性聊车，高尔夫也很好，特斯拉也很棒，奔驰宝马大家都喜欢，在此分享一下购车的一些想法和感受，祝大家都拥有自己的爱车。
我自认从工作以来和车的缘分还是非常深的，从 4S 销售到广告策划，又因为接触大众、斯柯达更多，再到家里换了奥迪后，与其说是喜欢，不如说是对这种德系品牌的习惯。结合到家里本身有车，我的车就不需要承担「家庭重任」，可以随我喜欢。但提车后的这一个多月，这台小车让我开始强烈的感受到「家的责任」。
提车日
购车在上海上半年疫情解封之后，去到奥迪4S店，看到店里积压了较多库存，当时我自己也没有特别倾向的颜色，A3的颜色除了红色我都挺喜欢，就在库存的冰川白、探戈红、环焦蓝、纳瓦拉蓝中，选择了较深的纳瓦拉蓝，张扬的造型配一个低调内敛的颜色。中配（时尚运动）的车型上，库存车上额外增加了四门无钥匙进入（+¥2000），加上购置税减半政策，实际落地20万不到。

奢侈与吝啬的交织
20万买 A0 小车，奢侈
最开始的选车首先当然是预算，20万以内，另外优先紧凑级，SUV 或 Sedan 我并不是特别在意，但两厢车型是我比较青睐的。第八代高尔夫和 A3 Sportsback 是最后的二选一，同样的预算高尔夫可以买到顶配 R-Line 版本，拥有更多的科技配置。而 A3 在20万内，只能说配置相对实用一些，没有氛围灯、副驾驶电动座椅等等这些。
网上说的最多的，就是 A3 不过是换壳高尔夫，还要加钱。说对也对，但在做工和实际的细微体验上，还是会有所差异。其实最后更促成下单的，是展厅销售的态度，毕业那年我自己也做过汽车销售，了解一些展厅里的道道。你如果问我，是不是有虚荣心的成本，那我的答案是肯定的。

不加2万上顶配，吝啬
从升级配置来看，时尚运动与豪华运动之间，相差近2万，增加了：

30色内饰氛围灯
电动折叠后视镜，带副驾驶侧下翻
副驾驶电动座椅与多向调节
三温区空调
主驾驶1…]]></summary>

背景
自高中起，就有将自己的错题整理到云端的想法，可以随时随地通过手机查看，便于复习。但是限制于当时的环境，不能方便使用数字工具，此想法便不了了之。不过「笔记数字化」的念头自此萌芽。
上了大学以后，接触到了 OneNote。将有价值的「文章」、上课的笔记、PPT「搬运」到OneNote 上，像一只勤劳的小仓鼠，不断囤积「知识」。看着软件日渐增长的「占用大小」，充满了成就感。但是工作之后，慢慢发现积累的这些「知识」无法应用到生产实践当中，很多笔记可能自「搬运」进 OneNote 之后便再也没有打开过。
偶然的一次机会，听到了 flomo 创始人少楠老师关于「知识管理」的讲座 ，其中提到我再熟悉不过的一句话：

搬运是一种浪费。

作为一位工业工程专业的毕业生，「搬运浪费」作为「八大浪费」之一是学习的重点，也是工作的切入点。但是我之前只将其应用于工作的生产过程，却忽略了自己的「知识加工」过程。我突然意识到，在我原本的知识管理流程中，「搬运」占据了很大一部分，而忽略了这是极大的浪费。这种搬运不产生任何附加值，也不会加深知识在自己大脑中的印象，也就不可能在以后需要的时候轻易调用。除了浪费时间和精力，顺便满足了自己内心小小的成就感和虚荣心之外，几乎没有益处。因为从生产的角度讲，「搬运」的知识只是从工厂门口搬运到了加工车间，堆放在角落里，几乎不可能搬上生产设备，更不可能成为有价值的「产品」。
在少楠老师的推荐下，我开始接触 《卡片笔记写作法》 一书，尝试使用双链笔记工具重新打造我的「知识加工厂」。

九月将至，大一新生踏入校园的同时，大四「老油条」们也开始准备自己的毕业论文与实习工作。学年论文与毕业论文时本科生绕不过的一座大山，以下是我在大四撰写论文时积累的一些个人经验与见解，希望对学弟、学妹们的论文写作有所帮助。
电子资源
文科专业的大部分学生在本科阶段，了解学界研究会借助知网、万方数据等文献数据库。国内高校图书馆也会购买文献数据库的使用权限，方便校内教职工与学生使用。在校园网中打开图书馆的网站，找到电子资源栏目，便可以看到学校已购买的电子数据库。除了学校提供的电子资源，不少地方图书馆对当地公众与读者提供电子资源，如国家图书馆、浙江图书馆在注册后便可免费使用。

扩展阅读：《免费看论文？除了学校的图书馆，还有 ……》

当我们搜索某个领域的文献，数据库会返回不少的文章，文章的质量良莠不齐，参考文献的作用时帮助你了解研究话题的学术现状、存在问题、解决方法等，导师进行论文指导也会强调尽量挑选时间较新的「核心期刊」与「原始文献」，注重文献的权威性、专业性与时效性。在数据库搜索时，我们可以通过筛选功能，选择来自「核心期刊」的文献，如北大核心、南大核心、SCI、EI、SSCI 等期刊目录。
期刊筛选
大部分阅读与参考的文献我是从万方数据下载的，PDF 文档方便在不同的软件中阅读与文献管理，二是万方提供的 PDF 文档默认自带目录与文字图层，知网（大陆版）默认只提供 CAJ 格式的文档，缺德到家。
Word 主题样式
不少大学生在「制造学术垃圾」使用的主流写作工具是 Microsoft Word，最头疼的除了正文写作，还有学术论文的格式规范。一篇学术论文的结构大致可分为以下四大部分：封面、目录、正文以及引用。
论文结构
以我大学的《毕业论文档案打印和格式要求》为例，除去页面设置、撰写规范、字词符号用法等要求，大部分内容的格式涉及到 Word 中的字…]]></summary>

As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words, and while that's not always the case with terminal commands and code, it still holds true for the graphical desktop. Screenshots capture precisely what's on your screen. I love taking them to have a record of who attends meetings, so I don't have to write it down at the moment. Or to capture a bug when doing UI testing. We all take them for different reasons, though, and there are more ways to take a screenshot than you might at first think.
I started thinking about screenshots after Jim Hall wrote an article listing GNOME screenshots, GIMP, and Firefox as the ways he often takes screenshots. And yet t…]]></summary>

Recently, I published my first book, The Kubernetes Operator Framework Book from Packt Publishing. Writing a book has always been a personal goal of mine, and so it seems fitting that I was able to check that off by writing about one of my favorite topics: Kubernetes.
My journey with Kubernetes began in 2016, as a software engineer for Red Hat OpenShift. There, I had the opportunity to work with (and learn from) some of the smartest folks in the open source community. I learned first-hand some of the best practices for Kubernetes development as they were applied to broad enterprise use cases. And as I watched the development of OpenShift 4 take shape, I got to witness the functionalit…]]></summary>

Notes are part of any writer's life. Most of my articles begin in a note-taking application and that’s usually Joplin for me. There are a large number of note-taking apps for Linux and you may use something other than my favorite. A recent blog article reminded me of a half dozen of them, so I assembled a list of my favorites.

Joplin is available on Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. I like Joplin because it automatically saves whatever you add to it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[为了给新人创作者提供制作播客的参考，此前播客志对录音场地、录音设备、后期工具、AU使用教程进行了大规模征集及分享，邀请故事FM、日谈公园、深夜谈谈等播客机构，Steve、重轻、艾文和金花等资深创作者进行分享。
本次推送延续此前的逻辑，在有了场地、设备等硬件设施后，分享一档节目如何诞生。也可以说是内容创作的SOP（标准流程），邀请声东击西、日谈公园、津津乐道、深夜谈谈、番薯剥壳工作室，讲述专业播客机构的内容生产流程，如何保证节目质量始终保持一定水准？如何协调不同工种间的工作？一期节目上线前要经历什么？
每期精品内容的产出都是在推动播客朝着行业化的方向发展，感谢各大机构工作人员的热情参与！

声动活泼
 

审核和内容收集
(虽然是具体情况具体分析，但是对于部分节目可以固定下来)
 
1、资料完善度
主持人需要详细的提纲，这对后面流程完善起到重要作用
主持人需要提交的是:嘉宾资料(姓名正确书写、头衔、照片、希望给到的社交媒体账号)+**建议标题**+采访内容&提纲+音频收集+建议删除内容
 
2、素材给到时间(1.5 小时，2 人对话)
负责人:主播+监制
素材一般提前7天，至少不晚于3/4日给到
 
3 播客完成版提交审核的时间
负责人:后期
后期的制作的重点永远是:时间节点，如果只给到2天时间制作，请用好这两天时间，没必要永远优化细化无止境的美化下去。
理想的完成版审核日期，是上线前1日以上，如果无法在1日之前提交，请提前在群中说明原因
 
此外:剪辑之前请提前和节目负责人(主播/监制)确认:是否需要给嘉宾审核，考虑到嘉宾时差(如北美时间)、工作繁忙(大公司CEO)，可能需要跨自然日审核，所以最好上线前至少两天给到嘉宾粗剪版用来审核.
 
比如周二上线商业Y酱，周一需要提交音频审核，如果周一无法提交审核，需要周五说明情况
 
 
剪辑时需要注意的细节

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[由于上学和工作的关系，最近十多年我一直住在机场附近。机场内会有比其他地方更加专业的气象观测设备，而且能做到实时更新。借助这个优势我养成了看气象报文、雷达拼图和Prog Charts来判断天气的习惯。当然了，我做着一份靠天吃饭的工作，肯定是比别人更关心天气。那今天跟大家聊一聊我在平时是怎么看天气的~
一般情况
系统自带的天气app永远是最方便易用的，开机即用功能简单。在把天气信息截图分享，一目了然。我就偶尔问Siri或者Google Assistant明天天气怎么样，享受一下有助手的高级感。
看本场天气
我一般住在机场附近，所以看机场的气象报文基本等于在看自己家的天气。METAR1报看实时天气，TAF2报看未来24小时。可以看到刮什么样的风，下什么样的雨，能见度适不适合出门拍照，几点到几点不能上天台晒被子，有+TSRA了去远程哄一哄被打雷吓到的妹子，等等这些。

在 Android 平台上使用的是 Avia Weather ，简洁而且免费，只看天气很够用。付费之后可以解锁Groups功能，可以把一些机场分类。
 
在iOS上用的是AeroWeather Pro，最主要的是它有好用的Widget，还可以添加到Shortcuts。订阅后可以解锁所有飞行中能见到的气象图表。
 
报文里乱七八糟的字母和数字看不懂没关系，有兴趣的童鞋推荐给你们两份指南，一份是FAA的，一份是USAF的 。
看未来天气
    
MyRadar和Windy的功能类似，可以选择查看的信息极其丰富，好多航校甚至是航空公司也会用他们的数据。想要看懂这些图？不如来这里学习一下：aviationweather.gov/help 。下面是看图经验：

被高气压控制，通常都是好天气，反之亦然
有黄色或者西红柿炒鸡蛋颜色的地方一定有雷雨
预判雷雨的移动方向和速度
准静止锋类似暖锋，有持续不断的阴雨连绵
孤立的雷暴单体，下雨也就是一阵儿
冬天爬山，可以在零度等温线附近打卡留念
等压线密集的地方，有大风！
预测你的航班会不会因为天气原因延误
朋友坐飞机，告诉ta在起飞后的多久会遇到明显颠簸
看到哪里有火山喷发，搜一下那里附近的人上传的视频

除此之外，还能在Flightradar24上查看到气象信息，搭配飞机的飞行轨迹，看雷雨绕飞更加直观。不过实时的飞行轨迹和滞后的气象雷达图之间会有错位，有时候感觉莫名其妙。雷雨天气去机场接朋友，可以精准地选择出发时间，能在家多待会儿就多待会儿。
  
 
如果订阅了ForeFlight，再去坐飞机，会让飞行体验有质的飞跃~
 
我想大多数人都不会为了简单看个天气去搞这么复杂，不仅要记住奇奇怪怪的符号还要在app之间换来换去。只是因为我的工作离不开这些，顺便就带到了生活中，用起来还很顺手，就一直这样了。
我印象中分钟级降水预报是前几年彩云天气最早做出来的，我也有一个同样分钟级预报的故事：有一天我恰好在AOC大厅的气象雷达屏幕前，我想能不能人肉播报一次天气预报啊，于是就给我远在老家的老妈打了电话。问她家里是不是阴天啦，有没有下雨啊，她说阴天了没下雨。我说过一会儿就下啦。电话里聊了大概十分钟之后，诶，雨就来了。
哦对了，如果你女朋友说，晚上吃完饭我们去海边散散步吹吹海风吧。你一定要纠正她，晚上在海边儿吹的是陆风，不是海风，要不然叫海陆风也行。总之，天气这件事儿一定要弄清楚。]]></summary>

 作为一个抖音受害者，我时常反思，有没有办法像刷抖音一样地学习？
 于是我拿出了 RSS 这个远古信息管理神器。 
上一篇文章，我们解决了「RSS 订阅源」的问题，本期内容我们就来解决 RSS 的第二大难题：RSS 阅读器。
一、RSS 阅读器
RSS 阅读器的选择，可以说五花八门。 
但总体上可以分为两种：一种是本地阅读器，一种是在线阅读器。
1、本地 RSS 阅读器
浏览器早期自带就有 RSS 阅读功能。 
但自从 2018 年 Firefox 也宣布取消 RSS 功能后，RSS 就彻底与浏览器分家。 
如今想要用 RSS，那么就要用浏览器扩展，又或者是客户端软件，现在常用的本地 RSS 阅读器有： 

本地 RSS 阅读器的特点，是操作感强，自定义功能多。 
但同时，本地 RSS 阅读器需要用自身网络来抓取更新，所以如果你不开启的话，那么就不会有新内容。
2、在线 RSS 阅读器
而在线 RSS 阅读器的特点，则是支持自动更新，还有跨平台同步。 
而且，一般还会有全文搜索、内容过滤、第三方服务集成等高级功能，现在常用的在线 RSS 阅读器有： 

但在线 RSS 阅读器的缺点也很明显。
 首先，免费帐户往往都会有订阅源数量、刷新时间的限制，并且还会有广告。 
所以综合而言，RSS 阅读器更好的选择是：使用本地 RSS 客户端来浏览在线 RSS 帐户。
3、Windows / 安卓方案
在 Windows 平台，我的选择是 Fluent Reader + Inoreader 内地版。 
Fluent Reader 是一款开源免费的 RSS 阅读器，界面简洁好看，而且是目前唯一全平台支持的 RSS 阅读器。 

Inoreader 的内地版（地址里比原来多一个 n），
是目前大陆地区，为数不多还能用的在线 RSS 阅读器。 …]]></summary>

众所周知，Square 出品的内存泄漏检测工具 LeakCanary 可以很方便的检测出 App 中存在的内存泄漏问题。当我们决定要不要在项目中引入 LeakCanary 的时候，经常也会听到声音：
“LeakCanary 接入简单，无需手动初始化。”
“LeakCanary 虽好，但就是太卡。”
“LeakCanary 虽好，但无法线上使用。”
一度我也是这么认为的，直到我认真研究了下才发现，事实可能并没有那么简单。本文就是尝试从 LeakCanary 的一些高级用法，来重新论证上述的观点。 文末会附上完整代码，可直接使用。
想要使用 LeakCanary 的一些高级用法，首先就是需要我们主动掌握 LeakCanary 的初始化时机，添加一些自定义的配置，下面就看一下如何手动初始化 LeakCanary ？
如何手动初始化 LeakCanary ？
正常情况下，我们只要添加下面一行代码，就可以在 App 中使用 LeakCanary 了。
dependencies {
  // debugImplementation because LeakCanary should only run in debug builds.
  debugImplementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:2.9.1'
}

自动初始化
这是怎么做到的？是采用了 ContentProvider 的加载机制来做的。简单讲大致流程如下：

先执行 Application中的attachBaseContext 函数；
然后会执行 ContentProvider 中的 onCreate 函数；
最后才会走到 Application 中的 onCreate 函数中；
那下面就看一下 LeakCanary 是怎么自动初始化的，首先是在…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一、背景
现在的移动应用，视频是一个非常重要的组成部分，好像里面不搞一点视频就不是一个正常的移动App。在视频开发方面，可以分为视频录制和视频播放，视频录制的场景可能还比较少，这方面可以使用Google开源的 grafika。相比于视频录制，视频播放可以选择的方案就要多许多，比如Google的 ExoPlayer，B站的 ijkplayer，以及官方的MediaPlayer。
不过，我们今天要讲的是视频的缓存。最近，由于我们在开发视频方面没有考虑视频的缓存问题，造成了流量的浪费，然后遭到用户的投诉。在视频播放中，一般有两种两种策略：先下载再播放和边播放边缓存。
通常，为了提高用户的体验，我们会选择边播放边缓存的策略，不过市面上大多数的播放器都是只支持视频播放，在视频缓存这块基本上没啥好的方案，比如我们的App使用的是一个自己封装的库，类似于PlayerBase。PlayerBase是一种将解码器和播放视图组件化处理的解决方案框架，也即是一个对ExoPlayer、ijkplayer的包装库。
二、PlayerBase
PlayerBase是一种将解码器和播放视图组件化处理的解决方案框架。您需要什么解码器实现框架定义的抽象引入即可，对于视图，无论是播放器内的控制视图还是业务视图，均可以做到组件化处理。并且，它支持视频跨页面无缝衔接的效果，也是我们选择它的一个原因。
PlayerBase的使用也比较简单，使用的时候需要单独的添加解码器，具体使用哪种解码器，可以根据项目的需要自由的进行配置。
只使用MediaPlayer：
dependencies {
  //该依赖仅包含MediaPlayer解码
  implementation 'com.kk.taurus.playerbase:playerbase:3.4.2'
}

使用ExoPlayer + MediaPlayer

2020 年 7 月 29 日，我来到了北京，开始了自己的北漂生活。工作之后发现时间过得很快，转眼已经北漂两年了。在北京短短的两年里，留下了很多珍贵的回忆。北漂一年整的时候就有写篇回忆录的想法，但迟迟没有动笔，如今已经开启了北漂的第三年，感觉是时候开始提笔写这篇回忆录了。
前段时间在中国好邻居家里吃了顿饭，听阮哥说起「到底什么是北漂」。我觉得每个人对「北漂」的定义都是不一样的。我理解的「北漂」，暂时先卖个关子。
在北京
当初自己本科毕业的时候首选的是在北京、上海、深圳三座城市找工作。大学因为没在一线城市读，时常懊悔和一线城市比，资源还是匮乏，所以工作说什么也要去一线城市感受一下。后来因为上海离家太近首先就排除了上海，加上一直没去过北方，就直接考虑了去北京工作。
当初考虑北京的因素其实有两个，一是北京的互联网氛围我了解到的是比上海、深圳要好的，比如很多互联网公司当时都是在北京成立的，二是我很喜欢音乐，作为全国摇滚的发源地，氛围这方面北京是当之无愧的全国第一。
其实在北京最大的一个感受就是舒服。曾经听网上有人用一个字来形容北京，那就是「土」。在北京生活了两年，倒也确实慢慢理解了北京的「土」。比如胡同的起名，比如北京人的打扮没有那么精致，比如 CBD 旁边可能就是普通居民楼。
胡同
很喜欢北京的一点就是有逛不完的胡同。虽然随着城市规划，胡同已经少了很多，但我两年里仍然没有把每一条胡同都走一遍。而且北京的胡同绕到完全能让人迷路，从这条胡同穿到那条胡同的感觉太奇妙了。
前段时间参加了朋友拍的《胡同日记·春》纪录片线下放映活动，衔接去年冬天拍的《胡同日记·冬》。在她的镜头下，我感受到了北京胡同里发生的美好。如果有机会，还是挺想搬去胡同住一段时间的。
最喜欢的就是鼓楼那一片的胡同，咖啡店和小清吧很多。不管是白天在胡同里找家咖啡店坐下来喝一杯，还是晚上和朋友吃完饭，穿梭在胡同里，…]]></summary>

前言
上一篇提到：Android—以面试角度剖析HashMap源码，分析了HashMap源码。为了加深印象，因此这篇将会实现手写HashMap！
话不多说，直接开始！（结合上一篇一起看效果更佳哟）
1、初始化
从上一篇我们知道：HashMap初始化分为：无参构造器；有两个参数的构造器。因此我们照虎画猫也来搞两个构造器！
1.1 无参初始化
从上一篇我们得知：
初始化无参构造器，对应map长度默认为：1<<4，也就是16
初始化无参构造器，对应扩容因子默认为：0.75f
因此，有了如下代码
public class MyHashMap<K, V> implements Map<K, V> {
    //     扩冲
    float loadFactor = 0.75f;
    //16  1<<4
    static int threshold = 0;
    Node[] table = null;
    // 2. 实际用到table 存储容量 大小
    int size;

    public MyHashMap() {
        threshold = 1 << 4;
    }
}

很简单，直接下一个
1.2 有参初始化
从上一篇我们得知：
有参构造器对应两个参数分别为：
initialCapacity 根据用户输入的数字，计算与其大于等于initialCapacity该变量的2的n次方，并且与initialCapacity最相近的值，该值就是对应map的默认初始长度。
loadFactor 该变量为：对应map默认扩容因子
因此就有了如下代码：
public class MyHashMap<K, V> implements Map<K, V> {
    //     扩冲
    float…]]></summary>

At this year's DrupalCon North America, EPAM Solution Architect John Picozzi presented a talk about the importance of non-code contribution. He talked about how everyone can get involved and why he believes this is an important topic. This article is a text adaptation of John's talk; find a link below to a video recording of the complete presentation at DrupalCon.
What is non-code contribution? I asked Google this question and got the following answer: "Any contribution that helps an open source project that does not involve writing code." Thanks, Google, but I already figured that out. If you asked me to dig deeper, I'd say it's about providing your time, skills…]]></summary>

写在前面
现在的我已经不再是一个学生，甚至也不再做研究。不过，写毕业论文的时候采用的工具和方法，确实一直沿用至今，已经为工作而进行了些许改良。在读硕士研究生的三年生活中（其实第三年已经在工作岗位上度过），我曾经尝试过不少与研究或者论文写作相关的数字工具；这些工具中有些帮助我在阅读文献的过程中准确把握文章意思，从而确定了个人选题；有些则在实验进展过程中帮助我看清数据之间的关系；还有些则是论文写作的时候帮了我大忙… 不过，这三年的研究生历程也让我越来越意识到，工具与效率之间并非强烈相关：或许有的时候工具的使用反而让人南辕北辙，采用更加精简的工具，以及加入更多个人的思考，才是完成研究工作的重点。
这篇文章仅仅是想要介绍自己在论文写作的过程中用到的一些工具与方法。我研究的科目是汉语作为第二语言习得。研究生期间除了研究本身，还需要承担一些教学工作，以及一些学生管理的工作，这篇文章也会有所涉猎。
Notion：是知识库，也是数据库，还是静态网页
Notion 的多面性与灵活性，我想少数派上的众多文章已经解释得清楚明白。但至于具体如何使用，这就看个人的情况了。在我个人的例子中，主要使用了 Notion 以下几个方面的特性：

数据库功能 - 用于学生信息管理、进度追踪、组会笔记
反向链接功能 - 用于阅读文献和笔记重点内容
静态网页分享功能 - 用于呈现课程大纲、更新课程材料

Notion 的数据库功能，由于数据库中每一条都可以单独作为一个页面，每一个页面上又可以创建新的数据库…… 如此嵌套之后，形成了十分灵活的数据库体系。无论是用于学生信息的管理、进度追踪还是系列笔记，都可以在短时间内搭建起较为整洁美观的数据表格。
Notion X 学生管理
研究生期间一大工作是助教工作，需要管理一个二三十人的留学生班级。在学期初，我从教务老师那里拿到学生名单之…]]></summary>

之前我跟你聊过很多次用卡片笔记法写文章的事儿。今天咱们换个话题，聊聊用卡片法做视频。
现在是移动互联网时代，学习和工作中需要用到视频制作的地方，还真不少。尤其是像我这样当老师的。

我这几年做了许多视频。但是实话实说，凡是复杂一些的视频，特别是技术类讲解展示，我在制作的时候总会感觉很焦虑。
焦虑的原因，是表达欲和成熟度不匹配。
我最想表达的时刻，往往是刚让电脑跑出来一个结果。这时候，我特别想把自己的成果和喜悦心情分享出去。
但是，一般这时候内容成熟度是不够的。例如前面的铺垫内容，还都没有准备好。讲解的思路，也都没有理顺。
怎么办呢？
常见做法，自然就是去查找和准备这些资料，直到胸有成竹。这样自己讲解内容时，才不会露怯。
可等到内容成熟度足够了，时间往往已经过去许久，我也没有那么想展示自己做出来的结果了，因为兴奋感衰退了。
很多有趣的内容，因此淹没在了我的笔记里。更可惜的，是那些没有记录下来的内容，就丢弃在风中了。可惜。
最近，我开始尝试用 Stable Diffusion 来人工智能绘图。这款工具真是非常强大。绘制出来的内容，比起 Disco Diffusion ，要精细得多。说明一下，我不是画家，上面描述的，是本人尝试对比后的主观感受。请不要跟我讨论某些风格上「Disco Diffusion 甩开 Stable Diffusion 几条街」之类的。不听不听。
举个例子，我最近开始读《九宫格写作法》这本书。里面有一段描述顾客尝试过一碗汤后的评论：

汤底是炖了 3 天的猪骨浓汤，配菜是汆烫得恰到好处的豆芽菜，吃起来脆嫩爽口。桌子上放有店家推荐的柚子胡椒，只需撒上一点点，柚子那清新的酸味便会让你眼前一亮。

我于是好奇心大起，就想尝试一下，这碗汤画出来是什么样子。于是我决定用 Stable Diffusion 来画。

早在今年 2 月，CalDigit 就正式在全球发布了新一代雷电 4 的扩展坞 TS4。作为 TS3 Plus 的升级版本，更多的接口和更高的规格，着实让我有了不少期待。和 CalDigit 的朋友联系之后，我也在 3 月中旬收到了这款真正让我「梦寐以求」的雷电 4 扩展坞。
但关于它和它背后的故事，还要从 2019 年说起。
缘起于 2019 年的一个期待
在 2019 年的年度征文中，我曾经描述过一个符合我需求的理想型扩展坞是怎样的。然而，由于 macOS 系统和雷电 3 的一些限制，我始终没有找到这样一款设备。在前前后后摸索的过程中，总计花掉了近一台 iPhone 11 的钱。
首先，由于 macOS 并不支持通过 DisplayPort 来实现 Display Chain，想要以扩展形式连接显示器就必须占用掉下行的雷电接口，否则就只能镜像显示。其次，雷电 3 在带宽的分配中，硬性规定了必须保留 18Gbps 的带宽用于显示信号（DisplayPort）的传输，实际留给数据传输的空间只有 22Gbps。而且，显示带宽在不足时，还可以占用这为数不多的 22Gbps 数据带宽，反之，就算没有外接显示器，数据带宽也不能使用为显示预留的 18Gpbs。
当时妥协但最好的选择：CalDigit TS3 Plus
直到雷电 4 的到来，这个情况才得以获得改变。
首先，Intel 在雷电 4 协议上取消了为 DisplayPort 预留 18 Gpbs 带宽，提供了满速的 32Gbps 数据传输（相当于 PCIe 3.0×4），尽管还…]]></summary>

软件的选择与流程的建立
在漫长的学习之路上，我遇到了学习软件，它们和我磨合、指导我的学习、被我不断的筛选。在这个过程中我逐渐有了一些想法来选择软件，并最终建立流程。
软件的主要特性-一切的基础
我也许从来都是一个缺少方法的人，直到软件进入我的生活，与其说它们是工具，不如说它们是我的一部分关于学习的性格。 我从不对软件硬性要求，要求它符合我的工作流程或是符合我的方法论，我对它们抱有了更大的期望，我对那些能做我以前做不到的事的软件抱有期望，因为它们的价值是难以衡量的。 于是我要求它有某种特性，可以与我使用的软件区别出来，完成我曾经难以完成的工作。
方法论-以实际的场景体现
软件的诞生一开始就会被打上开发者的烙印，就像是同样的教科书，不同的主编会有不同的侧重一样。如果一个软件有着鲜明的主要功能特色那它几乎一定体现着某种思想，但是方法论存在着问题，就是难以证伪，越是想用思想捏合成一座大厦最后会发现地基可能都是不牢的。那么如何使用方法论呢？
1. 与科学接轨，学习有关知识；对信息源可信度进行筛选
2. 在使用中验证方法论，最好有一定程度的量化
3. 简化抽象方法论，细化具体方法论不至于在臃肿中走向模糊
4. 重视全面和逻辑性 
扯远了，在软件的方法论验证中，重要的无疑是第二条。 如何验证呢，就是在它主张的场景使用它（或仅仅是想象使用），注意它的价值，这是我认为最好的方式，一个好的软件应该是向你描绘了一个出色高效的使用过程。 另一种方法是看受人欢迎的软件，某种意义上来说它的有效经过了人的验证，注意它的独特性即可。
软件的使用与功能的解构
当我们使用一款软件，很多情况下并不是按照作者给出的使用场景进行使用，但这不意味着这种使用是错误的，因为开发者不可能列出所有的使用场景，也与你的面对的场景不尽相同。了解软件的边界重点在于对其功能的理解。
1、具体的使用场景下蕴…]]></summary>
