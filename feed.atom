Moreover there are many senior developers in the community so if you are looking for a referral you can request for the same as well. You can Join the Community on Slack and Discord.
Data Structure and Algorithm are very crucial for getting selected in product based companies like MANG(Meta, Amazon, Netflix & Google). So these are some Mistakes you need to avoid while preparing for the same :- 
1- Do not Focus on Doing Maximum Question :- We generally focus on number of questions like solving 20 questions in a day and aim to do 1000 questions . This is completely a wrong approach as because of this we don't get the benefits of focusing on a question and solving it properly, so when you work like this your foundation isn't strong which is very important in an interview. So instead of targeting 1000 questions, do 400- 500 questions and take your time and build a strong foundation.
2- Solve a Problem on Pen and Paper :-  Generally many of us avoid writing on pen and paper and directly jump on to the question and start coding but before starting to code always ensure that you are writing a pseudo code or a flow chart in your notebook as it gives you an step by step approach.
3- Consistency :- This is the most Important point you need to be consistent, being consistent is hard but when you are preparing DSA consistency plays a very important role. It is not important that you have to solve 10 questions in a day , just start by solving 5 questions in a day and be consistent in it and by the end of just 3 month you will be able to solve 450 questions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s say you have two arrays and want to merge them:
const firstTeam = ['Olivia', 'Emma', 'Mia']
const secondTeam = ['Oliver', 'Liam', 'Noah']

One way to merge two arrays is to use concat() to concatenate the two arrays:
const total = firstTeam.concat(secondTeam)

But since the 2015 Edition of the ECMAScript now you can also use spread to unpack the arrays into a new array:
const total = [...firstTeam, ...secondTeam]
console.log(total)

The result would be:
// ['Olivia', 'Emma', 'Mia', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Noah']

There is also another way, in case you don't want to create a new array but modify one of the existing arrays:
firstTeam.push(...secondTeam);
firstTeam; // ['Olivia', 'Emma', 'Mia', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Noah']]]></summary>

Youtube short
I am talking about Wagmi the collection of react hooks for Ethereum.
This library has 280K downloads per month but only one 3K github stars. Just one line of installation code.
yarn add wagmi ethers

20+ hooks of collection for working with wallets, ENS, contracts, transactions, signing, etc.
Connect it to the existing wallets. 
Provide built-in wallet connectors such as Coinbase, Metamask etc.
Caching and request deduplication just like React Query
Auto refresh data when network changes or accounts.
Typescript support
This sounds good because when I started web3, I have to add these things manually mostly and have to develop these hooks on our own.
But this collection of hooks will certainly help a lot to the developers.
Just one of the codes to install the package and its dependency.
Create the client using providers and chain networks.
Pass the client to the Wagmi Provider and wrap the provider with the root of the application just like Redux and third-party libraries.
Manage wallet connection states such as auto-connection, ethers providers and connectors.
You can consider it as the Provider. It uses React Context to manage all the hooks configurations together.
Meaning letting all the hooks have the same centralised data or client configurations.
Add compatibility with different chains such as Infura, and Alchemy.
Provide Injectors to support the wallet by providing an Ethereum provider in the browser. Helps to easily provide wallet connectivity in your application such as Metamask, Coinbase etc.
The reusable functions provide all the features that wagmi supports out of the box to ease the development process.
Such as useAccount hook helps to get the connected user account details such as an address, balance and so on.
Web-3-react
useDapp
Web3Modal
I will cover another story with an in-depth understanding of the hooks provided by it.
Until next time, have a good day.
Keep developing

I've never done this before, so bear with me, as Google might come back and reject the action for some reason.
First of all, head over to your Google actions console and ensure you tested the app on all possible devices in the Test tab.
Once you are ready to deploy, head over to the deploy tab.

I started filling out the information on this page, and here are the required fields:
Short description
Full description
Small logo
Developer contact details
Privacy policy
Let me dive a little bit deeper into the Privacy policy as it's the one that might require some more work.
If you already have a generic one on your website, you can use that.
TermsFeed to generate one.
You can then follow Google's actions example of hosting it on Google Drive and making the link publicly available. They do an excellent job of explaining how it works inside the privacy policy step.
Mine looks like this: Google action privacy policy.
And once that's all filled out, head over to the release section in the left-side menu.
Check that you have gone through all the steps described and want to do a full rollout.

Once done, you'll either be prompted that it succeeded or missed a step somewhere. You can simply go back and fix it and try again.
In the end, your submission will be visible in the release section, and you should receive an email about this.

One day in March of 2020, a few of my Opensource.com teammates and I grabbed lunch to talk about how we would work from home for the next couple of weeks until this pandemic got nipped in the bud. At the end of the work day, I packed up my laptop and walked out the door of our office building. Several months later, we were all still working from home. None of us had returned to our office-based workstations. In July 2020, using safety precautions, we were granted access to our workstation solely to retrieve personal items. My desk was left exactly as I left it that afternoon in March. Expiring snacks stashed in my secret drawer. Picture frames collecting dust. Comic strips pinned up.

DDEV is an open source tool that makes it simple to get local PHP development environments up and running within minutes. It’s powerful and flexible as a result of its per-project environment configurations, which can be extended, version controlled, and shared. In short, DDEV aims to allow development teams to use containers in their workflow without the complexities of bespoke configuration.
DDEV replaces more traditional AMP stack solutions (WAMP, MAMP, XAMPP, and so on) with a flexible, modern, container-based solution. Because it uses containers, DDEV allows each project to use any set of applications, versions of web servers, database servers, search index servers, and other types of sof…]]></summary>

众所周知，Watch 有两种视图。第一个是「列表视图」，第二个则是「蜂窝视图」。我第一次用蜂窝视图的时候觉得这种交互模式非常炫酷，但是用了一段时间后的感受是 —— 「就像把杂货箱的东西全部倾倒出来，然后直到找着这一次需要的东西」。这无疑是一个非常糟糕的体验，因为每一次找 App 都要反复体验一下找杂物的难受感。所以这里触发了一个痛点是：「买完 Apple Watch 之后，我们应该如何快速找到并打开目标 app 呢？」
回忆一下小时候混乱的工具箱
本篇文章的前提 —— 在抛除了「Siri」、「程序坞」、「表盘上的快捷入口」三种检索方式的基础之上，再来探索有没有办法可以进一步提高效率，让我们的「应用菜单」也可以具备更强的检索性，做到井井有条。
Grid View（网格视图，我也喜欢称为蜂窝视图）
Part 1 思路总括
一开始我是换回了习惯的「列表视图」，依靠皇冠的转动来找到 App。但是列表视图有个问题是 —— 你无法调整 App 的显示顺序。就算你可以调整并分类 App，你也有可能需要在「单向」上线性地浏览众多的 App 之后才能找到目标，
List View（列表视图）
所以思路开始清晰起来 —— 如果我们把应用进行分类，并从中心延伸到几个不同的方向，就可以减少查找的时间和查找的路径长度。基于此，我们利用蜂窝的特性，从中心恰好可以切割出 6 条大方向，代表 6 个大类，然后把最主要的 App 直接放到 6 条线上。相当于至少提高检索速度 6 倍。
自制演示图
Part 2 和我一起来分类
现在，请大家停下 1 分钟，和我一起思考：我的 Apple Watch 上大致都有哪些 app 呢？对于我而言，我会分为以下 6 大类（逆时针），然后把最常用的放到线上：

健康
运动
音乐·声音
办公·社交·信息
支付
其他工具

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has switched to proof-of-stake, cutting its energy demands. The transition, which has been in the works since 2016, won’t change much for the average Ethereum user, but it sidelines miners. 
The switchover began on September 6th, when the Bellatrix upgrade was activated. It is now complete after the mining of the Terminal Total Difficulty block, which triggered the Paris upgrade. The technical part is done; now, we get to see what happens.
And we finalized!
Happy merge all. This is a big moment for the Ethereum ecosystem. Everyone who helped make the merge happen should feel very proud today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this tutorial we’ll be using the Page Visibility API to detect if a browser tab is idle (not currently being viewed) or active. To get an understanding of how the API works we’ll use it to pause a video when a tab becomes idle.
Let’s get started by setting up a HTML5 video player:
<video id="video" width="300" controls>
  <source
    src="https://archive.org/download/ElephantsDream/ed_1024_512kb.mp4"
    type="video/mp4" />
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML video playback!</p>
</video>

Now for the JavaScript functionality that’ll make use of the Page Visibility API. We first need to define an EventListener that calls a toggleVideoPlayback function when the Page Visibility visibilitychange event has been fired:
document.addEventListener("visibilitychange", toggleVideoPlayback);

Now let’s create the toggleVideoPlayback function:
const toggleVideoPlayback = () => {
  const video = document.getElementById("video");        
  return document.hidden ? video.pause() : video.play();           
};

This function checks the status of document.hidden. If this equals true the video will pause and if it equals false the video will resume playing. You can go ahead and test this code in browser now, note the timestamp when you navigate to another tab whilst the video is playing to confirm the video has been paused when you return.
That’s all for this tutorial. You should now have an understanding of how the Page Visibility API works. If you’re interested in learning about some of the other uses for the Page Visibility API the MDN Web Docs is worth checking out.]]></summary>

It is quickly possible to find out why something doesn't work and it is convenient to use visual tools to fix the problem but you still need to remember what you changed and repeat those changes in your editor. 
One of the engineers on our team showed me an idea he had. As both the browser and the editor (in this case Visual Studio Code) are based on the same platform (Chromium), it would be possible to integrate the convenient debugging experience of the browser developer tools right into the editor and not only change what is shown in the browser but also the source code that generates it.

来自谷歌 DeepMind 和牛津大学的研究人员发表的一篇新论文称，超级智能的 AI “很可能” 会给人类带来生存灾难。这篇论文设想地球上的生命将变成人类与超级先进的机器之间的零和游戏。他们认为，在一个资源有限的世界里，对这些资源的竞争是不可避免的。在未来的某个时刻，监督某些重要功能的高级 AI 可能被激励想出作弊策略，以损害人类的方式获得其奖励。

AI 机器人在论坛模仿发帖，导致用户互相指责对方是机器人

一位 YouTube 主播利用论坛的内容训练了一个 AI 语言模型，并将该 AI 模型用于 10 个机器人程序，然后在 24 小时内发了 1.5 万个论坛帖子。这些机器人虽然偶尔会犯错，但该论坛的用户花了两天时间才注意到问题，并识别出了其中一个机器人账号。机器人账号导致了用户之间的不信任，即使在关闭了这些机器人之后，用户彼此之间仍然会指责对方是机器人。

微软 Teams 以明文方式存储授权令牌

安全分析师在微软 Teams 的桌面应用程序中发现了一个严重的安全漏洞，它在 Windows、Linux 和 Mac 中以明文方式存储授权令牌，使威胁者能够访问认证令牌和开启了多因素认证（MFA）的账户。研究人员在 2022 年 8 月发现了这个问题，并向微软报告。然而，微软并不同意这个问题的严重性，并表示它不符合打补丁的标准。由于微软不准备提供补丁修复，专家建议用户改用浏览器版本的微软 Teams 客户端。


消息来源：BleepingComputer



老王点评：或许微软有自己的逻辑，不过微软这种否认后再提供补丁的事情也不少。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[经过两年的发展，自由开源的照片编辑器 PhotoDemon 的作者已推出了 PhotoDemon 9.0。新版本增强了用户界面，内置了对 Adobe Photoshop 插件的支持，支持了新的图像格式，减少了资源使用等等。根据用户在 “工具Tools > 选项Options > 更新Updates” 下的设置，已经安装了 PhotoDemon 9.0 可以自动收到更新推送。你也可以选择通过 “帮助Help > 检查更新Check for Updates” 手动更新。

PhotoDemon 这个便携程序提供压缩包下载。解压到系统，就能启动这个照片编辑器。可能最新版本会让Windows 可能会发出 SmartScreen 警告，VirusTotal 上的两个不太知名的杀毒软件也会报毒（以上都是误报）。新的 PhotoDemon 消耗的资源比以前的版本少，这是它的优点之一。例如，它在冷启动后使用的内存也比以前的版本少 12%。

用过老版本的用户切换到新版本可能会立即注意到新的界面。比如大多数选项现在都以弹出的方式显示，最常用的工具显示在工具栏上。根据作者的说法，新的用户界面使用了“旧版本不到一半的垂直空间”，而且不会牺牲功能。

用户界面仍然可以适配各种显示分辨率，包括 1024×768 这样的传统分辨率。且新版本中打开的照片会有更多空间。在早期的版本中，照片编辑器的选择工具表现出色。最新版本中包含对多选区的支持。添加选区、减去选区和相交选区可用于组合选择，即使在多个选区处于活动状态时，你仍然能编辑刚创建的选区。

内容填充工具，通常称为智能对象移除或涂抹，是另一个新功能。要使用它，用户可以选择 “编辑Edit > 内容填充Content-aware fill” 或 “选择Select > 修复选区Heal selected region”。虽然该工具是自主操作的，也能个性化一些设置和选项。该功能既不需要人工智能也不需要互联网连接。事实上，正因为如此，如果多次运行该工具可能会带来更好的图片。

PhotoDemon 9.0 支持新的图像格式。新版本提供 PSP 图片、AVIF 和动画 WebP 图像的导入和导出功能。尽管有 AVIF 支持，但由于其大小，并未内置必要的编码器和解码器应用程序。用户首次加载或保存 AVIF 文件时会下载必要的数据。现在可以导入 XCF（GIMP）、SVG 和 SVGZ 格式的图像。

最后但同样重要的是，PhotoDemon 9.0 支持无损 “quite OK”（QOI）照片、Symbian 图像（MBM 和 AIF）、漫画书档案（CBZ）和无损 JPEG（JPEG-LS）图像。作者称最新版本中的自动优化 GIF 的功能是同类产品中最佳的。新的神经网络颜色量化器也有助于依赖调色板的图像格式。

PhotoDemon 9.0 的新增增强功能包括：


图像调整器提供了 12 种复杂的重采样技术的实时交互式预览。

支持内置的 Adobe Photoshop 插件（8bf）。

完全支持 3D LUT（三维查找表）。

新效果包括渐变流、凹凸贴图、Droste 和 Truchet 贴图。

改进了结晶和染色玻璃的工具。

一种新的去雾工具，用于恢复“被雾霾或雾霾破坏”的照片。

新的用户界面和改进的工具性能曲线。

为了“更好地匹配 Photoshop 的实现”，照片滤镜工具已经过重新设计。

EA sees a big opportunity in games that let players create their own content, CEO Andrew Wilson said at a Goldman Sachs conference on Tuesday, as reported by Axios. Games like Minecraft and Roblox with extensive player creation tools have become huge hits with enduring popularity, and it sounds like EA wants to find more ways to let players create content in its own titles. 
He highlighted a few EA franchises he feels have notable creative aspects already, like The Sims (which will soon be free to play), FIFA, and Battlefield, and talked about how the upcoming live service Skate title will offer many opportunities for player creation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[树莓派操作系统更新，增加了对 NetworkManager 支持以及新的操作快捷方式。




如果你是小型迷你计算机的狂热粉丝的话，你可能知道树莓派可以用作成熟的桌面计算机使用。此外，它也是支持各种电子/物联网项目的核心组件。

虽然许多 Linux 发行版为树莓派提供了镜像文件，但树莓派基金会仍然提供了其官方操作系统，即 树莓派操作系统Raspberry Pi OS。

顺便说一句，树莓派操作系统是基于 Debian 的。具体来说，当前版本是基于 Debian 11 Bullseye 的，它是采用 LXDE 作为桌面应用环境的轻量级操作系统。

树莓派操作系统：带来了什么最新内容？

尽管这个最新的更新并不是一个重大更新，但它仍然带来了一些有用的补充。如果你把树莓派用作桌面计算机来使用，你一定会欢迎它的。

让我们来看看新版本提供了什么。

主菜单的快速搜索功能

虽然 Windows 系统和许多 Linux 发行版已经包含了这个基本功能，但树莓派操作系统之前一直没有这个功能。

用户可以点击“树莓派”图标或键盘上的默认主机键，打开主菜单，键入要启动的应用程序的名称，就会自动出现一个新的搜索框。

可用向上和向下箭头键来浏览菜单，用回车键选择应用。



如果用户不键入任何内容，则主菜单的功能与点击“树莓派”图标以显示应用程序时的功能完全相同。

再也不需要用鼠标光标来打开应用程序了。

全新的键盘操作快捷方式

就像主菜单一样，你还可以通过键盘打开 Wi-Fi 和切换蓝牙功能。

按下 Ctrl+Alt+W 将打开 Wi-Fi 菜单，而 Ctrl+Alt+B 是用于蓝牙的。

增强型音频输入控制

任务栏现在将为输入和输出设备显示两个单独的图标，而不是单个默认音量图标。



每当连接音频输入设备时，扬声器图标旁边也会弹出一个麦克风图标。此外，如果连接了多个音频输入设备，用户可以右键单击该图标从列表中选择设备，而左键单击将显示音量控制滑块。

支持 NetworkManager

NetworkManager 是许多 Linux 发行版用来处理网络功能的流行的守护程序。它包括许多功能，可帮助用户相应地调整和配置网络设置。

如果你想进一步了解，请在此处了解有关 Linux 中守护程序的更多信息：


什么是 Linux 中的守护进程？为什么使用它们？


就其功能而言，引入了对 NetworkManager 的初步支持，以作为 dhcpcd 的替代选项。这意味着用户可以轻松管理 VPN 连接，而不会有太多麻烦，甚至可以将树莓派配置为一个 Wi-Fi 接入点。




请注意，NetworkManager 的支持应该还在测试中。为了获得稳定的网络体验，建议用户继续使用 dhcpcd。

如果你仍然想尝试 NetworkManager，则需要遵循一些高级步骤。但可以放心，如果在使用 NetworkManager 时遇到任何问题，可以选择切换回 dhcpcd。


如果你想了解有关该版本的更多信息，官方发行说明 包括了更多详细信息。

获取树莓派操作系统

前往下面链接的官方下载页面下载新的镜像文件。


获取树莓派操作系统


你可以在任何系统上使用树莓派 Imager 来制作要在树莓派上使用的 microSD 卡。不管如何，你都可以单独下载树莓派操作系统文件进行设置。

NFT-inator 3.0 is the go-to option to generate an NFT collection without any code all in the browser. You bring the art layers and they do the rest. 

It's also totally free ...unlike some other products that charge thousands for a simple 10k collection 👀

The best part? Once you have your collection's art created you can deploy a smart contract with an awesome mint button you can embed anywhere.

We always prop up tools that make Web3 more accessible and open. Diamond Hands Hotel's NFT-inator is a perfect example of making the whole effort of launching an NFT collection easier without paying an arm and a leg upfront 😤.

So go ahead and launch that collection you always wanted to launch - now is the best time!

A lawsuit filed in San Francisco by a Tesla owner claims the automaker and its CEO / Technoking Elon Musk are “deceptively and misleadingly” marketing the Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving” advanced driver assistance features that are available as paid software add-ons (via Automotive News).
The filing claims Tesla and Musk “deceived and misled consumers regarding the current abilities of its ADAS [advanced driver-assistance system] technology and by representing that it was perpetually on the cusp of perfecting that technology and finally fulfilling its promise of producing a fully self-driving car,” and that “contrary to Tesla’s repeated promises that it would have a fully self-driving car within months or a year, Tesla has never been...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introducing ezcv!

From the POV of fellow college students, the typical resume builders like Google Docs, LaTeX, Figma, and even drag-and-drop resume builders seem to lack something or another. Whether it’s agonizingly recreating layouts you’ve seen online, or re-entering bullet points over and over again, I wanted to revamp the typical resume building process and make it as simple as typing.

Everything is generated and formatted automatically for you, all from some basic markdown-like rules. Simply use the builder to generate desired template sections, input your own information, and play around with customization.

Plaintext is only saved locally (to the browser), so it’s recommended to copy any text you’ve made and save it elsewhere once you’re done. When you want to pick it back up, you can simply paste and get to editing.

💬 No sign-up & free! Get started in seconds.
💸 ATS friendly. Bypass those corporate parsers and get an interview.
🎨 Tons of customization. Choose the best from a handful of templates, fonts, and from one to two columns with a few clicks. There’s live preview!
📄 Export to PDF. Export to the most widely used resume format to start finding your dream job.
🌙 Dark mode... for when you’re jobhunting at night.

 From one job-hunter to another, hope you enjoy, and let me know what you think of my summer project! Thanks!

- Tiffany

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[起因：加班太多，病倒了
之前公司赶项目进度，我所在的团队两个月无休连轴转，导致身体负荷太大，生了一场小病。医生的诊断是免疫系统出了问题，虽然对日常生活影响不大，但可能无法根治，只能慢慢调理。从诊室走出来后，我立即将「保持身体健康」这件事的优先级「置顶」了，决定开始改变以前一些不健康的生活习惯。
除了调整作息、加强锻炼，也开始研究日常的营养摄入。但是关于营养，我除了知道几个类似「高油、高糖、高盐要少吃」、「卡路里超标会肥胖」、「高蛋白可以增肌」的碎片化概念，似乎也没有更加深入的认知了，一时有点无从下手。
于是我决定先从书里找找答案。
灵感：从食物多样性入手
在豆瓣的书单和评分榜上一番搜寻，我注意到了《你是你吃出来的》这本书。看完之后，书里提到的一个概念让我印象深刻：人类是杂食动物，吃得不够全面，是营养失衡最常见的诱因。
1.身体器官出毛病，主要是因为细胞损伤得快，修复得慢。
人体内的细胞都是在以固定的速度更新换代，比如血管的内皮细胞 1 天就会死亡；胃黏膜细胞 3 ～ 5 天更替一次；肺表面的细胞寿命是 2 ～ 3 周。当细胞修复的速度高于损伤速度，就是健康的，「青黄不接」则容易出毛病。
2.上述过程所需的「原材料」，唯一来源就是日常摄入的食物。
虽然生病后吃药可以抑制、缓解症状，但并没有根本上改变细胞更新的平衡。更合理的方式是通过日常饮食提供充分的「原材料」，让细胞更新的平衡有序地运转下去。
3.人体所需的营养元素十分庞杂，很难靠少数几种食物就满足。
比如上皮组织，如果人体内缺乏胶原蛋白，细胞之间的缝隙会加大，上皮细胞的保护功能就会减弱，管腔中的血液就会渗透出去，形成皮下出血。比如摄碘不足或者过量都将影响甲状腺功能，造成甲状腺的损伤。不同的身体器官，所需要的营养元素不尽相同，综合起来，身体所需的营养是个相当复杂的集合。如果日常只是摄入少数几种食物，就容易导致营养「偏科」，被忽视掉的营养元素可能导致某些器官的细胞更新的失衡。反之，吃得越杂，营养越容易均衡。
《中国居民膳食指南 2022 》中也有类似的建议。《指南》共有8条核心准则，其中第一条就是「食物多样，合理搭配」，并明确建议「平均每天摄入12种以上食物，每周25种以上」。
来源：《中国居民膳食指南》官网
动手：「吃得杂」简单易行，但似乎没有趁手的工具
作为一个打工人，我认为「吃得杂」的策略十分可行。一方面，我不仅仅满足于吃得饱、吃得爽，必须要提升下日常营养摄入的质量。另一方面，又也不想在营养搭配上花太多的精力，比如研究某些「神奇食物」、详细规划每一餐的卡路里、食物成分等等。「吃得杂」的策略就成了质量和效率的平衡之选。
 
「每周25种」开始成为我的饮食准则。
我开始有意每餐都吃一些不一样的食物，降低自己的营养「偏科」风险。 做起来似乎其实不难，菜市场买得到的，或者快餐能点的，随便组合下基本就能达到。 但这个策略执行了一段时间，我发现总是记不住这周吃了多少种。
为了记录饮食，我也尝试了几个现有的应用，但要么功能太庞杂，各种 Banner 、营销推送满屏飞，要么记录成本太高，功能太偏向专业用户，比如要记录食物的重量、卡路里等等参数，而实际上我并不需要这么精确的食物成分管理。
我既想知道自己有没有做到「食物多样」，又不想在这 [记录] 这个环节耗费太多的精力。既然工具不趁手，就自己做一个。
「杂食记」——帮你达成「每周25种」的健康膳食目标
 
量化当周的膳食目标达成进度，以及基本的种类分布。

记录时只需要记下种类，不需要输入其他繁琐的参数。

分析饮食数据，帮你更了解自己的饮食偏好，同时支持小组件。
提供分析图表，并支持小组件
可通过食物库管理食物，内置了常见的食物，当然你也可以自定义添加。

按日期查询每一天的详细记录，当然也可以删除。

其他小功能：定时提醒，帮你养成记录习惯；自定义每周膳食目标，给自己「加码」

希望大家一起好好吃饭
调理营养可能是个很复杂的事情，你我身上也背了很多责任和限制，没法做到永远把「营养调理」摆在第一优先级，但我们也许可以从好好吃饭开始，日常习惯做一点微小的改变，就能帮身体的营养维持该有的平衡。希望我的 App 可以帮大家迈出第一步，从「每周吃够25种」开始，变得更加健康。
关于App的其他

目前是买断制，另外App内有打赏页面，各位用得顺手可随缘投喂。
发布才一个多月，功能和体验还在持续优化进步中。大家有任何建议或吐槽都可以通过站内信或者App内的邮件地址联系我。
Bug一定马上改，但功能不会随便加，尤其是与「每周25种」无关的功能会更加谨慎。同时，我觉得除了记录、查看分析之外并，大家没有必要在这个App中停留太久，希望做到「真·用完即走」、「真·小而美」。]]></summary>

LPC 2022 上，谷歌工程师披露了 MGLRU 项目的最新进展。作为当前 Linux 内核页面回收代码的一个更好替代方案，如果 MGLRU 能够在 2022 年进入 Linux 6.1，那它也将成为年内最激动人心的创新之一。从 ChromeOS / Android，到台式机、工作站、甚至服务器领域，MGLRU 普遍能够在各项工作负载和各类硬件平台上提供更好的性能。一旦进入主线，它的下一个改进是让 MGLRU 达到可以安全地默认启用的程度。

老王点评：在这次 LRC 大会上，谷歌宣讲了好几个重量级的技术进展。




到 2030 年，软件将占拖拉机公司约翰迪尔收入的 10%

美国农机巨头约翰迪尔公司的所有拖拉机和收割机都标准配有自动驾驶功能。该公司现在计划在几年内将 150 万台机器和 5 亿英亩的土地连接到其运营中心，并将之前销售的没有自动驾驶功能的拖拉机升级自动驾驶功能。尽管农民已经在为运营成本，如化肥和燃料，而苦苦挣扎，但该公司希望为运营其越来越智能的车辆出售软件订阅。分析师估计，农用软件的平均毛利率为 85%，而设备销售的毛利率为 25%。

老王点评：软件和硬件哪个重要？从汽车到拖拉机，纷纷采用软件订阅，这是不是说明软件越来越重要，而且软件的利润也更高。




谷歌在欧洲面临 250 亿欧元的反垄断罚款

谷歌是最大也是最重要的广告技术提供商，市场份额超过九成。欧盟以及英国的监管机构正在调查谷歌是否滥用其在数字广告市场的支配地位，可能导致其面临 250 亿欧元的反垄断罚款。去年法国的反垄断监管机构对谷歌开出了 2.2 亿欧元的罚单。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BrewMyMac! Possibly the coolest way to install apps and customize your Mac!

With BrewMyMac, you can choose from a wide range of apps and tweaks and install them with a single click. It is a much better way than going to each app's website separately and starting all the downloads manually.

I am a software engineer and architect working for a consulting firm. Over the past seven years, I've used seven MacBooks - four provided by my companies and three by clients. Every time I received a new MacBook, I had to go through the painful process of installing more than 20 apps necessary for my work. I needed to search the Internet for tweaks on how to customize the look'n'feel of my Mac and change its default behaviors to suit my style. That was a tedious process. I often ended up spending 3 or 4 days on that, and I still missed installing some apps and tweaks.

A couple of years ago, I made an Ansible Playbook automating all these. It was a success. It set up my Mac in minutes. But it is a tool for developers only and I wanted to share it with other power users. That's why I made BrewMyMac.

BrewMyMac allows you to install over 10K apps from Homebrew and Homebrew Cask, and Mac apps from App Store. You can customize your Mac with the 49 tweaks provided. After you finish selecting which apps and tweaks to install, it generates a single-line command which you can copy-paste and run in Terminal. That command will handle the rest including the installation of Homebrew and Ansible.

Under the hood, BrewMyMac is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. It uses a free no-code service as its database. There is no backend code implementation, making it portable and free to use.

BrewMyMac is an open-source project and is currently in the beta testing phase. I'm excited to hear any comments, questions or feedback.

当你安装一个应用程序时，你通常是在安装一个软件包，其中包含应用程序的可执行代码和重要文件，如文档、图标等。在 Linux上，软件一般被打包成 RPM 或 DEB 等格式，用户只要通过 dnf 或者 apt 等命令就可以进行安装了，这取决于你使用的 Linux 发行版。然而几乎每天都有新的 Python 模块发布，因此你很容易遇到一个尚未打包的 Python 模块。这就是 pyp2rpm 存在的意义了。

最近我在尝试安装一个叫 python-concentration 的模块，但是进展并不太顺利：

$ sudo dnf install python-concentration
Updating Subscription Management repositories.
Last metadata expiration check: 1:23:32 ago on Sat 11 Jun 2022 06:37:25.
No match for argument: python-concentration
Error: Unable to find a match: python-concentration


虽然这是一个发布在 PyPi 的包，但它仍不能被打包成 RPM 包。好消息是你可以使用 pyp2rpm 以一个相对简单的过程将它打包成 RPM 包。

首先你需要设置两个目录：

$ mkdir rpmbuild
$ cd rpmbuild && mkdir SPECS


像这样去安装 pyp2rpm：

$ sudo dnf install pyp2rpm


1、生成 spec 文件

Seth Kenlon
Wed, 09/14/2022 - 03:00

            
The typical setup for Internet connectivity today is for your home to have a router, usually a little physical box located somewhere in your house, that acts as a gateway to the rest of the world. The router creates a local network, and you connect your devices to it, including your computer, mobile, TV, game console, and anything else that needs to connect to the Internet or to each other. It's deceptively easy to think of this setup as there being two "sides" of your router: On one side there's the Internet, and on the other, your devices. That's an awful colloquial, though, because in reality there's an entire worldwide network of computers on one side of your router, and your digital life on the othe…]]></summary>

Bobby Gryzynger
Wed, 09/14/2022 - 03:00

            
When using a complex Kubernetes operator, you often have to orchestrate Jobs to perform workload tasks. Examples of Job implementations typically provide trivial scripts written directly in the manifest. In any reasonably-complex application, however, determining how to handle more-than-trivial scripts can be challenging.
In the past, I've tackled this problem by including my scripts in an application image. This approach works well enough, but it does have a drawback. Anytime changes are required, I'm forced to rebuild the application image to include the revisions. This is a lot of time wasted, especially when my application image takes a significant amount of time to build. This also mean…]]></summary>

我多次遇到用户抱怨 LTS 和稳定版的应用软件包有问题，但又声称开发版从来没有发生过这种事情。然而，以我在软件包技术方面的经验和知识，我不能不强调，这是不对的。

发行模式不是问题的根源所在，根本的问题是传统的软件包格式不适合现代的图形应用，不管是什么发行版。那么像 Nix 和 Flatpak 这样的格式是如何解决这些基本问题的？有趣的是，大多数服务器确实利用了容器化（即 Docker），因为它提高了可重复性并增强了可维护性。我们可以从中得到启发，采用一个适用于 Linux 桌面的类似标准。

免责声明


“传统软件包”是指使用包管理器发布的图形应用程序，而不使用容器，如 apt、dnf、pacman 等。

“发行模式”是指发行过程，如长期支持版（LTS）、稳定版和开发版等。

“类似的应用程序”是指两个在技术上真正相似的应用程序，如 Visual Studio Code 和 Code - OSS。

在这些例子中，我将使用 Arch Linux 作为参考。然而，这些行为与那些大量采用传统软件包格式的发行版是一致的。

Nix 不使用容器，它也不是一种容器格式。但为了简单起见，我暂时把它称为一种容器格式。


根本问题

大多数（或许不是全部）大量采用传统软件包格式的发行版都有这个共同的问题：它们都没有利用容器或其他方便的方法来分离依赖关系。用通俗的话说，容器是一个盒子，我们可以把东西放在里面，在不影响主系统（主机）的情况下单独使用它们。

容器通常不会影响“盒子”外的任何东西。并且它们…]]></summary>

在这些工具当中，我们对上手简单、功能强大且完全免费的飞书多维表格，其实也有自己的「一套说法」。
虽然不能像大会上提到的那些团队「一张表管公司」，多维表格的确也在过去这段时间里帮我们解决了很多问题：曾经有过这么一段时间，我们的团队沟通工具是 Slack、选题看板放在 Trello、协作文档服务是 Quip、跨组项目进度同步依赖 Teambition、作者运营工作放在微信群……每一处都需要有人花时间和精力去维护，工作群里时不时也会蹦出几条消息提醒老麦，XX 团队服务又该续费了。
飞书多维表格的上线，则让「不花一分钱解决业务需求」成为了可能。如果你没能第一时间观看「2022 年春季飞书未来无限大会」的线上直播，不妨跟随本文一起认识多维表格，看看这套工具在我们的团队中是如何发挥作用的。
首先，它是一张（更好用的）表
接触过 Excel，上手多维表格就已经成功了一半。如果你已经有了原始数据，甚至可以在飞书文档右上角的「新建」菜单里，直接将 Excel/CSV 格式文件导入为多维表格。

能否用好多维表格，另一半因素在于你是否清楚自己的需求，或者说后续如何对表格数据进行加工、处理。和所有优秀的互联网工具类似，飞书也在多维表格的创建流程中提供了海量的模板，既能搜索、也能通过左侧导航分门别类进行筛选，成员分工、项目管理、分销记录、防疫报备、周报月报……下次同事按耐不住剁手的冲动想要续费什么团队服务之前，先打开多维表格的模板用他念叨的那些关键字搜搜看？

当然，我们将多维表格和 Excel 类比，最主要的原因在于，和恨不得把所有选项都堆在工具栏的 Excel 不同，…]]></summary>

在我们的会员介绍页面，有三个简单的图形，这背后是产品负责人的设计思考，它代表着一个三角形切割打磨成圆形的过程，其实也完美的诠释了少数派业务与会员服务的关系，以及我们未来的愿景。这套图形也正是会员周边的核心元素，我想把背后的故事讲给大家听听。
超值的六边会员服务
代表着我给会员定制的六个方面的服务，它们分别是专属内容、专属产品、高质社群、定制周边、商品福利、共创增值，逐个给大家讲讲。

专属内容
最近几年，短视频爆发，娱乐内容泛滥，大量的攫取着我们的时间。但我们始终认为，如果想让工作和生活变得更好，单靠娱乐远远是不够的，我们需要持续的学习和成长，持续的创新和创造，而深度图文+语音对谈，依然是承载这类内容的最佳方式。而这些经验和思考类内容，稀缺性强，生产成本也高，且很难获得广告支持，会员服务将支撑我们长期深耕这些内容，不断扩展领域，让会员用户跟我们共同成长。

比如一份针对用户消费领域的深度报告内容，制作周期可能长达数月，目前已经针对机械键盘、显示器、咖啡、录音设备等领域推出了这类消费报告。帮助大家全面完整的了解这些产品和用法。
专属产品
我们几乎开发了一套完整的会员产品模块，从页面设计、产品功能、用户体系，都在围绕会员进行规划和重构，我们不像以往的互联网公司那样，为了流量去做大而全，而是希望不断提供独特的创新的产品使用体验。

会员用户可以给我们最直接和有效的反馈，更有很多产品从业者，甚至能跟我们一起共创有趣的新模块。除了内容、商品，我们甚至希望联动线下服务。
高质社群
家家都可以做社群，做好社群却很难，少数派本身就是…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[得到这台文石Tab8实属偶然，起因是一位朋友给我传送了文石可用旧Kindle换新设备的「ok计划」。俗话说得好，甘当分母总会成为分子，于是我喜提Tab8，也就有了这篇测评。
注：尽管Tab8是用一台旧Kindle以及测评本身换得，但是本文内容和观点不经文石干涉。

我和第四台文石
虽然我在去年才亲自掏钱购入一台文石，但由于我对大尺寸电子墨水屏设备的贪恋，和文石的缘分在更早之前其实就开始了。
20年入职少数派时，派内闲置的一台Boox Note Pro让我眼前一亮——这不就是我想要但买不起的那个东西吗！于是立刻占为己有使用了好几个月。彼时文石还未将骁龙芯片纳入使用，采用的是自研芯片，所以——墨水屏设备有的毛病它都有。除了使用自带阅读器Neo Reader读PDF等本地文件，使用应用市场下载App的使用体验都非常糟糕，卡得飞起。但即便如此我还是用它看完了几部《铳梦》，卡顿和闪屏并不妨碍大尺寸的电子墨水屏给我留下了非常良好的阅读体验，只是那时的文石确实让我觉得，这离一台我会自己花三千大洋购入的墨水屏设备着实还有一段距离。
2020年底，文石将新设备的芯片统一更换为骁龙6系。对于手机来说早已过时的芯片在电纸书上来说却非常堪用，于是没过多久我就购入了一台Boox Note3，至今服役一年有余。在这台设备上，阅读本地文档和手写批注的体验已经非常丝滑，微信读书E-ink版本这类优化过的App体验感也上佳。但对于更进一步的网页阅读、未针对墨水屏优化的App，仍只停留在「能用」的程度。
2021年底，文石又推出Note 5+，一位朋友购入后我也写写画画了一番，这台设备拥有柔性屏上盖、磁吸笔设计、系统顺势更新，但总的而言是一次中规中矩的升级，当时并不构成我想换掉Note3的理由。
而2022年推出的Tab8直接定位在了「快刷阅读平板」，演示图中也赫然出现了飞书、金山文档等办公软件，起初我对这个…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“
              Solutions is a collaborative board game (and online board game), designed by Sam Levac-Levey, based around discussion of climate solutions. Think of it like Cards Against Humanity but for climate change.   As you strategically deploy various climate solutions, you will be tested on your knowledge and ability to prioritize. In order to avoid the worst of the climate crisis, you will need to think critically about each solution and discuss with your teammates. The game was designed for gamers, non-gamers, and even those who have no particular interest in climate.

Sam and his team spent thousands of hours to build the game’s foundation on cutting-edge climate research. For example, the core solutions in the game are inspired by the work of Paul Hawken, the co-founder of Project Drawdown. Other research, such as the feedback loop cards and the starting points for global temp, are based on NASA, the IPCC, NOAA, Yale, Stanford, the World Resources Institute, and more.

Sam and team created Solutions to help you have fun while also having meaningful discussions about climate change. I'm hunting this because its a great game and you can learn a lot. Cheers!

        <updated>2022-09-13T08:58:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[白描是一款简单好用的 OCR 文字识别与扫描工具，主要功能有提取图片中的文字，图片表格转 Excel，公式识别，文件扫描，身份证扫描，合成PDF等。现在，白描除了可以在手机上和网页上用，Windows 版本正式发布，支持 Windows 7/8/10/11，目前白描已经包含 iOS、Android、Windows、Mac、网页、小程序多种版本，想在哪用就在哪用。除小程序外，所有平台的会员通用，也就是说，在手机端买个会员，就可以一个账号全平台使用了。

截屏 OCR 识别
首先，白描 Windows 版本最方便的就是截屏识别，App 运行后，会在右下角托盘有个小图标，右键小图标可以有更多操作，比如：截屏识别。

除了通过托盘图标菜单识别，可以在白描设置界面设置截屏的快捷键，识别更高效。

截图后会弹出识别结果页面，左侧是截图后的原图，右侧是文本结果，在识别结果页面可以复制结果，导出 Word 或 TXT 文本。
截图不只是文字识别，还可以公式识别、表格识别

如果是表格识别，在识别结果的部分可以直接导出 Excel，公式识别可以直接复制为 LaTeX 格式。

如果你平常截图识别的种类非常多，又识别文字，又识别表格，又识别公式，又识别二维码，可以在设置里打开自动检测图片类型，软件会根据检测到的类型自动进行相应的识别。
文字识别
除了截屏快捷识别，也可以在主界面中进行操作，在左侧选中图片文字提取，便可以进行普通的 OCR 文字识别，支持单张识别，批量识别，长图也同样支持直接识别。

主界面的文字识别，除了图片格式，也支持直接将 PDF 文件拖入识别，首先软件会将 PDF 的所有页面解析为图片，然后进行识别。

表格识别
主界面左侧切换为表格识别，可以直接将图片中的表格转换为 Excel 格式，无论带线还是不带线的表格都支持。

如果有多个表格，也支持把表格识别为多个工作表（Sheet）。
公式识别
主界面左侧切换为公式识别，可以将图片中的公式转换为文本，复制为 LaTeX 格式。

关于会员
白描手机 App 中购买的会员可以直接在 Windows 版本中使用，在设置页面登录账号就可以了。

点击这里去 白描官网 下载。
关于另一个 Mac 版
白描之前已经在 Mac 的 App Store 中发布了 Mac 版本，此次又发布了一个新的 Mac 版，是一个可以独立下载安装的版本，基本功能和上面介绍的 Windows 版本一样，同样支持截屏识别、文字识别、表格识别、公式识别、PDF 识别，不过他还有另一个功能：让你的 Mac 变成一个 OCR 识别服务器：

如果你会一些编程，又拥有一台 Mac 电脑，想自己实现一个 OCR 的工具，那可以使用白描提供的服务器服务，发挥你的想象力，做出任何自己喜欢的 OCR 识别工具。
这部分如果感兴趣的人多，会考虑单独写一篇文章来介绍服务器模式。

在都柏林举行的 2022 年 Linux Plumbers 大会（LPC）的 Rust 小型会议上，介绍了 Rust for Linux 工作的最新状况。Linux 内核已经有了很好的 C 语言编写的 NVMe 驱动，西部数据的测试显示，虽然其开发的 Rust NVMe 驱动仍处于早期阶段，但其驱动性能与 C 编写的驱动一样好。会议上介绍了最新的补丁系列是如何被精简以减轻上游工作的，以及过去一年的各种进展，但是关于 Rust 何时并入主线，会议上并没有披露具体的时间表和进展。

老王点评：非常好的信号，但是大家都更关心什么时候能进入主线。




PyTorch 成为 Linux 基金会的顶级项目

开源 Python 机器学习库 PyTorch 成为 Linux 基金会托管的顶级项目，成立 PyTorch 基金会，其理事会的核心成员包括 AMD、AWS、谷歌云、Meta、Azure 和英伟达。PyTorch 最早由 Facebook 创建，自 2017 年以来，已经有超过 2400 名开发者在 PyTorch 基础上创建了 54000 个项目，PyTorch 成为了 AI 研究的主要平台之一。

老王点评：PyTorch 是一个不错的项目，在 LF 的支持下，应该会有更好的发展。




思科承认“阎罗王”勒索团伙泄露了其数据，但表示没有问题

5 月份对思科进行了攻击的“阎罗王（Yanluowang）”勒索团伙周末在暗网上公开泄露了盗取的文件。显然，思科选择不支付勒索团伙要求的勒索，这导致被盗数据被公布。思科的威胁情报部门证实了所泄露文件的真实性，并重申其业务没有受到不利影响。然而，“阎罗王”勒索组织说，其窃取了多达 55GB 的数据，其中包括源代码和机密材料等敏感信息。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这组织的名字真是别致，但是到底对思科有没有影响，只有思科自己知道。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[中年的汪二眼里已经没有了光，头顶却越来越光，脱贫没脱掉，却脱了发，还和颈椎病斗争了多年，最终还是和颈椎病共存了。
汪二有个儿子，每当小儿写作业的时候，就在后面，天天唠叨抬头。汪二摸了摸硬直的颈椎想：此生因为颈椎没能成为乔布斯，下一代不能在此再折一次啊。

汪二在某宝上买了一些防止小朋友写作业低头的产品，有物理挡着的，有智能硬件提醒的，都不甚理想，小儿要不是完美避开了物理障碍，就是把电拨了。
为了呵护下一代的乔布斯，也为了当代打工人还能为祖国健康工作三十年，幸福生活一辈子！
汪二挥洒着中年程序猿的余晖，花了数月写了一个新的App，它叫顶瓜瓜！
如何使用
打开App，放在桌前手机支架，角度随意，只要能拍到头即可，然后脑袋上会顶个西瓜，姿势不正确的时候，西瓜会掉下来。
 
 
当你低头了，离桌子太近了，歪头了，它会用有多种方式提醒你，屏幕闪烁和语音提醒（可选择鸭子叫，或真人发声），如果你有Apple Watch，手表会振动。

灵敏度松严可调，建议在写作业时调松，用电脑时调严一点。

在公司里，为了打工人在使用时避免被老板当成在玩自拍，App 设计了10几个花式 Animoji 拟我表情头套可选（也可能更像在玩自拍），随着使用时长增加还可逐步解锁更多表情。

除了可以顶西瓜，当然你也可以顶个榴莲、书、花瓶、鸟窝、皇冠等。不要低头！低头皇冠会掉！打碎了贵重的花瓶也不好啊。
除此之外，它也是一个蕃茄钟应用，你可以选择不同时长来使用，完了有完善的统计功能可供日后分析。在App 上可查看当日/月/年/近7日/近30日专注时间，以及不良坐姿统计，数据存储采用 iCloud Private Database ，它仅由你自己可以查看自己的数据，最大化保护你的隐私，并支持多设备数据同步。
小组件
支持 iOS 16 锁屏小组件和 iOS 14 桌面小组件

作为一个AR应用，顶瓜瓜上线的第二天就获得了 App Store 推荐啦！🎉

关于用户隐私
App 使用 iOS 系统的机器学习，完全本地运算，无需联网，你也不用担心衣装不整时使用会被汪二偷看，另外和汪二的其他作品一样，无广告，无事绝不推送，绝不推送，送。。。
支持设备
App 利用了设备的搭载的前置原深感（TrueDepth）相机，需要 iPhone X 或 iPad Pro 11-inch及后续机型才能使用(即支持FaceID)。更多参考：https://support.apple.com/HT209183

David Both

I recently experienced another interesting problem in the Linux startup sequence that has a circumvention–not a solution. It started quite unexpectedly.
I was writing a couple of articles while making some updates to my personal copy of my series of books, "Using and Administering Linux: Zero to SysAdmin." I had four instances of LibreOffice Write open to doing all that. I had three VMs running with VirtualBox to test some of the things I was writing about. I also had LibreOffice Impress open to work on an unrelated presentation. I like to listen to music, so I had one of several tabs in Firefox open to Pandora, my music streaming service of choice. I had multiple Bash shells open using…]]></summary>

It takes more than a blockchain node to build enterprise-grade applications at scale. As a result, developers often find themselves building plumbing from scratch to make their business logic work. The release of Hyperledger FireFly changed blockchain development, offering developers a full stack of tools to build and scale secure web applications using familiar APIs. FireFly’s next-gen platform simplifies development, making it easy to connect across multiple public and private chains while running many use cases simultaneously. Whether you want to build on permissioned chains like Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, or Enterprise Ethereum, or public chains like Ethereum, Poly…]]></summary>

When I was around 5 years old, my father brought home our first computer. From that moment on, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in computers. I haven't stopped hanging around them since. During high school, when considering which specific area I wanted to focus on, I started experimenting with hacking, and that was the moment I decided to pursue a career as a security engineer.
I'm now a software engineer on the security compliance team. I've been at Red Hat for over two years, and I work remotely in the Czech Republic. I've used Linux for about 12 years, mainly Arch Linux and Fedora, but I've also administered Debian, Gentoo, and Ubuntu in the past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[继 7 月的《PasteNow 2.3 发布：支持 Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴》后，PasteNow 2.4 又带来了一个非常实用的功能，即「将最近一个项目粘贴为纯文本 」。
新特性：将最近一个项目粘贴为纯文本
在 PasteNow 的使用场景当中，复制粘贴文本是其中最常见的一个场景，而其中又有一部分的需求是将富文本以纯文本的形式粘贴出来，或者换句话说就是：去除文本的格式。
PasteNow 一直都有按需去除格式的功能，它可以按纯文本粘贴或原始格式（富文本）进行粘贴。不过这个过程会需要将 PasteNow 的界面唤起，并按下内置的快捷键来达到这个目标。如果需要多次处理较多的文本，处理起来就会相对比较慢了。
于是在 2.4 版本中，针对这一场景，PasteNow 引入了一个新的快捷键，即「将最近一个项目粘贴为纯文本 」。通过设置成自己习惯的快捷键，然后就可以非常迅速地以统一的形式在任何 App 里完成文本的去格式粘贴，这个过程甚至不需要将 PasteNow 的界面呼出来！
举个例子，比如要将一个网页富文本以纯文本形式粘贴至 Word，首先将「Option+Command+V」设置为快捷键后，接下去只需要这样操作：

在 Safari 里按下 Command + C 复制一段网页文本；
来到 Word，直接按下 Option+Command+V，那么这段网页文本就会以纯文本的形式粘贴至 Word 里面。

请看视频演示：
 
 
相信通过新增这个快捷键，PasteNow 可以又快又好地完成纯文本粘贴这一场景的需求。
macOS 版本及 iOS 版本的其他更新
和以往版本一样，每个版本也会带来旧有功能的完善和修复，其他更新有：

调整音效的音量大小，使与系统当前音量匹配；
修复无法复制正在编辑的标题的问题；
修复无法显示其他应用保存的 JPEG 格式图像的问题；
修复 macOS 端修改列表名称后，没有同步至 iOS 端的问题；
修复暗色模式下，在一些白色背景的剪贴板文本下无法显示标题和快捷键标识的问题。

其中 iOS 版本最主要的变化是完善了对 iOS 16 的适配：

修复了在 iOS 16 Beta 版本中，底部工具栏会布局错乱的问题；
修复无法通过搜索标题找到对应项目的问题。

小结
目前 PasteNow 还有很多需求和功能有待去实现，我会继续保持节奏，将其不断完善下去。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[得益于开发者们最近的贡献，在 Ubuntu 中使用自己的强调色是很简单的。


每个 Linux 发行版都有它们默认的主题，具有各自的主色调。强调色用于在各个设置中突出主色调。通常，主色调和强调色应该形成对比和补充。

在最近的 GNOME 桌面的更新之后，Ubuntu 桌面在 22.04 LTS 版本中引入了强调色。

尽管如何应用它们是显而易见的，但是为了 Linux 的新手，我将解释如何在 Ubuntu 桌面中使用强调色。

在 Ubuntu 桌面中应用强调色


从应用菜单中打开 系统设置System Settings

进入 外观Appearance 菜单

在 风格Style 菜单下，你应该见到一套预设的颜色。

选择其中的一个来改变强调色。


一旦更改，强调色将被应用到 GTK 应用程序中的选区和 GTK 控件中，如切换按钮和文件夹的默认外观。

默认的强调色是橙色，有十种颜色可供选择，具体如下：


橙色

树皮色

鼠尾草色

橄榄绿

铬绿

普鲁士绿

蓝色

紫色

品红色

红色




（LCTT 译注：树皮色是一种棕色，鼠尾草色是一种灰绿色。）

你应该记住一点，深色和浅色的主题的强调色组合可能改变你的桌面的整体外观。

以上的特性只是只适用于目前使用 GNOME 桌面的 Ubuntu，而不适用于其它提供原生 GNOME 的发行版，例如 Fedora Workstation。因为有一些内容是由 Ubuntu 团队开发的，并且并没有合并到 GNOME 上游。

Kubuntu 中的强调色

使用带有 KDE Plasma 桌面的 Kubuntu，你可以简单地使用强调色。KDE Plasma 提供了预设的颜色，也有自定义的颜色选择器选项。另外，自 KDE Plasma 5.25 起，强调色可以根据壁纸来改变。

为了在 Kubuntu 中改变它，跟着下面的步骤走：


在应用菜单中打开 系统设置System Settings

进入 外观Appearance > 全局主题Global Theme > 颜色Colours 标签

选择你的强调色




我知道 Lubuntu 与 Xubuntu 并没有这个特性。而且它不太可能很快到来。

使用愉快。

Unix 的起源

如今，几乎整个世界都运行在 Linux 之上。数以十亿计的移动电话和服务器运行在 Linux 之上。但在 Linux 之前，是 Unix，没有 Unix 就没有现在的 Linux。

Unix 的起源可以追溯到人类登陆月球的时候。在 1965 年，三个著名的机构共同开展了一个操作系统研发项目，准备开发一个能够服务多个用户，并共享数据和资源的操作系统。



这三个机构是著名的 贝尔电话实验室Bell Telephone Laboratories、通用电气公司General Electric Company（GE）以及麻省理工学院Massachusetts Institute of Technology（MIT）。这个合作项目被称为 “Multics” —— 即“多路传输信息和计算业务Multiplex Information and Computing Service”的缩写。

不幸的是，该项目并没有见到成功的曙光，由于系统设计复杂且没有什么成果，贝尔实验室停止了该项目。

曾参与该项目开发的贝尔实验室的 肯·汤普森Ken Thompson，也投入到了新的工作中。在 数字设备公司Digital Equipment Corporation（DEC）的一台古老的 PDP-7 计算机上，他重新开始设计了一个新操作系统。不久后，丹尼斯·里奇Dennis Ritchie 也加入了，二人一起设计了分层文件系统、设备文件、命令行解释器以及进程。这就是 Unix 的诞生过程，它的名字是由 Multics 项目的另一名成员 布莱恩·克尼汉Brian Kernighan 给命名的。（LCTT 校注：前不久，80 高龄的布莱恩还为他共同创造的 AWK 添加了新的特性。）

产生学术外脑的需求
自大一使用数字化笔记伊始，我就开始钻研如何更好地阅读「课本」。每一门课程推荐阅读的参考书目，最后都通过我的知识处理流程成为我知识仓库的一部分。相应的，作为知识处理载体的 MarginNote 是以书目为主要处理对象进行加工的。我对任一知识的理解，都以文本为土地生长于文本，也正因为如此，它们始终无法脱离文本。当我在想到某一点时，我总会进而联想到这是在书中的第几章。这恰是因为我所阅读的参考书目，本身为了阐述这一理论时，已经形成一套体系，通过作者对理论的理解串而联之，因此我想要从中抓取的不过是我对于作者自建的知识系统的读取（以及批注）。这使得我对知识的理解方便快捷许多，因为每一知识之间的联系已经植根于文本之中了，我的学习过程更接近于摘取树木结出的果子。
当开始进行理论课题研究后，我就不再能直接参考一套现有的体系，而必须要创造一套“知识系统”，使其能完整地说明这一课题对象的方方面面。只有具有了足够扎实的土壤，也就是与课题相关的足够知识，才能够创造出一棵身形完整的树木。这时候我需要从知识仓库的储备中选择合适的对象，说明其中的联系，哪颗葡萄长在哪根藤上，才能够写出一篇言之凿凿详实陈告的学术论文。
学术论文是厚积薄发，其内容相较于写作之人所掌握的知识必然是瓢水量海。因此，一篇优秀的学术论文背后离不开一个硕大的知识仓库。如果我们能够借用之前学习的思路，也找到一个载体能够更好地帮助我们进行这样的知识处理和储存，那么最后的输出步骤也会相应地高效清晰很多。
这样一个用以进行专业知识输出的载体，我称之为「外脑」。
外脑的作用并非是取代我的脑子替我进行思考，而是尽可能地储存和展示我记忆的内容和产生的思考。它作为知识处理的辅助工具，清除的是我在课题研究中容易遇到的障碍，比如

VMware 在 Linux 内核邮件列表中报告，在内部测试发现，在 ESXi 管理程序上运行使用 5.19 版 Linux 内核的 Linux 虚拟机，使用单一 vCPU 的计算性能下降高达 70%，网络性能下降 30%，存储性能下降高达 13%。而关闭了 5.19 版内核中的 Retbleed 补救措施后，ESXi 性能恢复到 5.18 版的水平。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：许多 VMware 用户可能会在生产中使用 Skylake CPU，这样的性能损失不可能接受，那就只能冒着风险了？虽然这个漏洞并不太容易利用。




停止十年的 Ubuntu 线下峰会将于今年 11 月启动

Canonical 曾经在每个 Ubuntu 开发周期中举办 “Ubuntu 开发者峰会”，但那是十年前的事了。后来它在变成了一个线上活动，然后逐渐消失，转而变成支持 Canonical 的内部路线图规划和其他员工之间的开发者冲刺的活动。新的活动现在名叫“Ubuntu 峰会”，即将于 11 月在捷克的布拉格举行。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：不知道 Ubuntu 峰会会不会带来一些惊喜？总感觉现在每个 Ubuntu 版本的发布都缺乏令人激动的新变化。




微软推出点对点流媒体技术 eCDN 解决方案

微软的企业内容交付网络（eCDN）可以提高加入直播流的参与者的数量，使其有可能满足有众多参与者的公司范围的会议。这是一个基于 WebRTC 的解决方案，利用了点对点流媒体技术。微软称，微软 eCDN 可以同时容纳数百万的参与者，而不会使企业网络过载，也不会遇到视频流的质量、安全和隐私方面的麻烦。


消息来源：Redmond Mag



老王点评：大规模实时流量还是得依赖点对点应用。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[什么是最危险的 Linux 命令？

有人无数次问我这个问题，我一直避免回答，因为没有一个明确的危险的 Linux 命令清单。

你拥有的工具使你能够控制和修改你的操作系统的每一个方面。我不是想吓唬你，但如果你不熟悉这些命令和工具，你可以很容易地把你的系统摧毁。

想象一下家庭中的小孩子的情景。孩子有许多方法可以伤害自己。但这是否意味着不应允许孩子离开婴儿床？那会对她的成长造成损害。

这就是父母设定界限和引导孩子的地方。不要靠近火堆，不要把手指戳到电源插座上……随着孩子的成长和经验的积累，她可以把炉子打开，在壁炉里生火，插上电源线。

同样，如果你知道一些已知的风险命令，你可能会避免落入巨魔的陷阱，他们试图欺骗你运行命令，扰乱你的系统。

当你积累了经验，知道了这些命令和工具的含义和用法，用愚蠢和棘手的命令破坏你的系统的机会就会减少。

我的同事 Sreenath 收集了一些流行的危险 Linux 命令。让我们看看它们是如何干掉你的 Linux 系统的。


免责警告：如果你不清楚你在做什么，请勿尝试本文提及的这些命令，否则后果自负。


1、rm -rf /*

这个可能是在各种社交媒体上盘旋的最臭名昭著的命令。你会经常发现巨魔们在各种讨论中提及这个。

rm 命令用来删除文件/目录。标志 -r 和 -f 表示递归地删除指定目录内的所有文件。现在，如果没有 root 权限，这个命令不会造成任何伤害。

运行 sudo rm -rf / 命令也不会产生任何问题，因为大多数发行版提供了一个故障安全选项。你需要指定 --no-preserve-root 才能实际运行它。

sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root


然而，一个更简单的版本可以是这样的：

sudo rm -rf /*


它将开始递归地删除根目…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stable Diffusion 的人工智能绘画能力，我在之前已经不止一次给你展示过了。
 
 
目前， Stable Diffusion 的代码和模型都已开源。按理说，每一个感兴趣的用户，都应该正在开心地尝试作画。但是，这种模型执行起来，需要足够的算力支持。前些日子，你还得需要一块专业级 GPU 来运行它。我买不起专业 GPU 怎么办呢？就从 Google Colab 租了云 GPU 来用。为此，还交了钱订阅 Colab Pro 。

而随着最近 PyTorch 对苹果 ARM 芯片支持的完善，你现在完全可以在自己的 M1/M2 Mac 上面运行 Stable Diffusion ，来获得绘图结果了。
想想看，不花一分钱去租或者买 GPU ，就能在本地出图。那岂不是相当于把一个插画师随身携带了？想想都兴奋。
但问题是，在上周，为了实现这个功能，你还需要按照别人提供的详细教程，在本地安装一系列的软件包。

设置上稍微出点儿问题，往往就会让小白用户手足无措。

嘿，我明明只是打算输入文本生成图像，为什么需要达到计算机二级终端命令行操作水平才行？
这个痛点，不只是想尝鲜的新手会有，就连专业人士也会觉得很麻烦。这么多年被图形界面宠坏了，大伙儿早就更习惯了窗口交互。连换个描述语，都要在一行行代码里面做文本替换，不愉快。

今天我偶然看到了一个新的 Github 项目，叫做 Diffusion Bee ，可以有效解决咱们这个痛点 —— 终于，在 M1/M2 Mac 上面，图形界面开箱即用。不需要手动安装依赖、命令行输入参数，更不用对报错调试…… 总之，你可以直接用 Stable Diffusion 来画图了！

项目链接在这里。你需要做的，就是点击这个硕大无朋的 Download 按钮，下载安装包。

然后，双击打开软件包，拖拽图标，即可完成安装。

执行安装后的软件包，软件开启。

I have a dozen or so physical computers in my home lab and even more VMs. I use most of these systems for testing and experimentation. I frequently write about using automation to make sysadmin tasks easier. I have also written in multiple places that I learn more from my own mistakes than I do in almost any other way.
I have learned a lot during the last couple of weeks.
I created a major problem for myself. Having been a sysadmin for years and written hundreds of articles and five books about Linux, I really should have known better. Then again, we all make mistakes, which is an important lesson: You're never too experienced to make a mistake.

Over the years, several friends have asked me for tips on managing their home networks. In most cases, they are setting up home automation and want to access their services from the outside.
Every time I helped them, each made the same comment: "Are you kidding? It cannot be so complicated to publish one simple application!"
Publishing applications that don't put your network or cluster at risk can indeed be quite complicated. When we started working on Traefik Hub—the latest product by Traefik Labs—I knew it would be a game-changer for publishing applications.
This article demonstrates the complexity of publishing services and how Traefik Hub makes your life a lot e…]]></summary>

在最初打造 work-life balance 的居家空间时，物件的采购上确实更接近科技爱好者的「实用主义」，比如 BenQ 和 Wit 的灯具，极米的投影，甚至是全屋各个插座配置的多口氮化镓充电头等等，从实际体验到购买参考上的价值角度，每一件都很适合作为社区里「新玩意」栏目中的内容进行分享。

但「器材」带来的兴奋很快就会过去，分享欲被时间消解，最近的购买也渐渐转向了那些「谈不上多有用，但就是喜欢」的东西，索性就用一个合集，整理一下最近带回家的「朋友们」。
「红磨坊的舞会」油画&Pantasy 拼奇积木神奈川冲浪里
前段时间的高温天气着实难熬，因为旅行家里空了几天，返沪时才发现在客厅的长杆蜡烛都被融弯，于是下定决心要换上一些「蓝色系」的点缀，试图在视觉上让自己有清凉的感觉。

抱着这样的想法最近频繁逛了市集、旧货仓库和线下家居店，终于找到一副以深蓝色为基色的油画 ——「红磨坊的舞会」（Auguste Renoir Bal du moulin de la Galette）。原作来自法国印象派画家雷诺阿，这一副卡通版本的画家卖家自己也不太清楚，似乎是在某次展览中撤下的作品，尺寸为 150cm x 90cm。第一眼见到就无比喜欢，清爽浪漫的童话感觉很适合用来调和目前客厅的沉闷，秒付款带回家后立刻替换了原先的主装饰画，现在从房间出来一眼就能看到这一簇蓝色，令人身心愉悦。

照片里的另一抹蓝色是之前一同西北旅行的队友寄来的礼物，我们曾相约在未来走遍国内还未涉足的地方，但不久后他就入职了 Pantasy 拼奇积木，这两年屡次邀约都因为工作忙…]]></summary>

Seth Kenlon

There was a time when 5 MB was the reasonable maximum size for an email attachment. Today, it's easily possible for a single photo to be 5 MB. Accordingly, the maximum attachment size has increased to, say, 25 MB. But of course file sizes are getting bigger and bigger too, and so eventually the attachment limit will go up too. It's an endless cycle, common in the digital world: the tools are built for today's data, and today's data increases in complexity and size until the tools are revised and improved. You have to contain data, preferably in the smallest packaging possible, so that sharing it online goes faster for everyone. Here are five ways to optimize images for the Internet.

我们总是看到这样的例子——当一家软件公司开始做大做强，用户量飞速上涨之后，他们的产品往往就走向一条不可挽回的庞杂之路。开发团队试图用更多的新功能和更大的饼圈住更多用户，越来越臃肿的界面和逐渐扩充的体积也让用着老设备的用户更加痛苦。
不过大厂也并非所有产品都如此不堪，总有一些优质应用，因为顶着「大厂」的帽子让用户望而却步。这篇文章就简单介绍几个由头部开发商开发的小应用，希望这些好产品能得到它们应有的认识。
微软数学：你手机里的数学老师
平台：iOS / Android / 网页

微软数学是一款用来求解数学方程式的 App——但它不止于此。通过拍照、手写或者是键盘输入待求解的方程式，它不仅可以帮你求出结果，还可以查看详细求解过程，必要时还会附加图片，再也不怕答案里的「略」。
书签、历史记录功能都很完善，App 还提供了测验功能，可以根据运算过的方程式生成类似的题目，帮助你巩固知识点。详细的功能我们在之前的 App+1 文章中有过介绍，如果你常常被数学困扰，微软数学可以让你的学习之路更加轻松。此外，Edge 浏览器已经内置了微软数学，你可以在打开含有数学公式的页面时尝试这一功能。
Layout：快捷图像拼贴工具
平台：iOS / Android

Layout 是一款用来拼接图片的 App，开发者是当时推出了多款独立图像编辑应用的 Instagram。Layout 功能简单，操作也很直观，选择图片与给定的拼接模板即可。不过在 Facebook（Meta）再次改变策略后，这些独立应用又都纷纷整合回了 Instagram。2020 年 Instagram 上推出的 Layout 功能就是这款 App 的延伸。
Layout 上次更新停留在 2018 年末，但其体积小巧，功能粗暴，成图迅…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[视频文字稿部分
引子
2016年秋季发布会
开头的这段演讲来自于 2019 年的苹果秋季发布会，Tim 在台上说，在苹果创办的这 40 年里，教育深深的植入进了苹果的 DNA。其实回想一下历年来苹果对外的发言，对 DNA 的表述一直是非常谨慎和克制的，尽管苹果做了许多成功的产品，但你很少会听到什么东西构成了苹果的 DNA，在我的印象中只有两个，乔布斯当年说苹果要始终走在科技和人文的交叉口，这算是一个，而 Tim 口中的教育，则是另一个。而今天这期苹果护城河的视频，我们就来聊聊教育。
坦率来说这个话题其实很早就进入了我们的选题库当中，甚至早于创建这个频道，很早之前我跟零号喝酒的时候就聊起过，你作为一个从业者，是没有办法去忽视苹果在这方面的成就的，但同时我们也知道，这注定不是一个迎合流量的选题，客观上来说，教育这个产品的目标用户不是我，可能也不是看视频的你，做这个选题是很有风险的一件事，有可能费了很大的劲，最后数据非常差。但我后来想清楚了，既然说教育是苹果的 DNA，那我们不妨就看看苹果在教育领域都做了什么，从这些动作和体验的细节上，我们也许就能知道，苹果为何而苹果，他到底哪里不一样。这期视频没有竞品分析，可能在一些细分领域苹果还有一些对手，但把苹果所有的投入放在一起时，尤其在国内的大环境下，苹果其实是没有竞品的，这是苹果真正的护城河。那让我们正式开始。
人人能创造

我们从苹果官网开始，把官网拉到最下面看索引的部分，可以很清晰的看到五列，代表苹果在国内的所有业务，其中第四列全部都是 to B 的商业业务，这里你就能看到 Apple 与教育的入口。打开之后你就能看到教育业务线有三个分支——基础教育、高等教育和高校学生。

我先来给大家简单说几句后面两个，这两个大家应该是非常熟悉的。高校学生这个，就是大家最熟悉的教育优惠，页面当中会比较详细的介绍利用苹果产品和配套的 app 都可…]]></summary>

自我介绍和学习内容
第一次在少数派发文，简单介绍下自己。我从事轨道客车研发工作，就职于吉林长春国企大厂。懂得同学应该知道坐标了，不懂但感兴趣的同学欢迎私聊骚扰^_^。虽已毕业多年，因为从事研发工作的原因，还是要学习输入许多新技能和知识。借着少数派“我的数字文具盒”征文活动，作为非“学术”仅“研究”人员的我，也来蹭蹭热度。
本文要和大家分享我在备考剑桥商务英语（下文用“BEC”缩写代替）高级学习备考过程中使用到的几个数字文具。考BEC高级的初衷简单到有些俗气：通过考试，公司每月发1000软妹币的外语补助，每两年需要重考一次。（让大家见笑了）
出于一切为了钱财的本我思想，我开启了BEC的备考通关之路。本文仅和大家分享备考过程中使用的工具（硬件和软件），不涉及到备考应试的相关技巧。我也会整理关于BEC学习及应试方法的文章发在少数派上，感兴趣的同学可以关注一波。

帮我通关BEC的数字文具们
10.5寸ipad pro配合一代apple pencil是我数字文具的基础载体。2018年入手的这一套组合，现在用起来体验依然良好。
数字文具一：GoodNotes
我使用Goodnotes做BEC网课的课堂笔记。电子笔记对于字迹不好且排版混乱人士（是我自己没错了）极其友善。
作为一个写字丑星人，我无论怎么注意排版和字迹，笔记的可读性都差到不行。上学时的课堂笔记混乱到没有人性，每次拿自己笔记复习时，我的内心都无比emo。“记的这些破玩意，鬼才愿意看。哪里来的自信用这么好看的本子呢？还不如随便用张纸，写完就扔来得痛快！”这样的想法从小到大，有过不止一次。
时代在发展，社会在进步！使用电子笔记可以随时调整笔记排版，虽然依然无法拯救我丑恶的字迹，但笔记整体的可读性大大提高。对于解释性的图片、题目、清单等内容，直接截图到笔记中再调整好大小。笔记质量“真的比之前有了一…]]></summary>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

本文写于 iPhone 14 Pro 发布当日，会在后续考虑对一些过时的内容进行更新，如有谬误欢迎指正。
在 2022 年，智能手机显然不再是一个噱头十足的产品类别了。但在 Apple 的下一个重大产品类别「Reality」AR 眼镜出现前（或者说成熟前），iPhone 仍然是 Apple 需要全力以赴迭代以吸引消费者更新的产品。而 iPhone 14 Pro 的有趣之处在于：纵然它的硬件特性和我在发布会前预知的几乎完全吻合，我却从发布会前的「不太考虑购入」变成了「计划购入」。

iPhone 14 Pro 之所以能制造这样的反差，说明其主要吸引力不止硬件特性，而是在各种无法被硬件特性所囊括的设计与解决方案里。
事实上，硬件特性和其吸引力的相关程度低，是大部分高端产品的共性。而落实到 iPhone 14 Pro 这个产品上，影响其吸引力最重要的便是交互设计与软硬件协同、为专业用户设计解决方案的能力，以及能让它在部分方面「不思进取」的资本。
通过今天这篇文章，我想分享一下在 iPhone 14 Pro 发布之后的一些杂思，围绕「iPhone 14 Pro 对我们设计『高端产品』的启示」展开。
注：这些杂思中可能有一部分我在曾经讲过类似的观点。然而，想到互联网的随机性让我们每次的表达能触及和启发不同的人，便觉得适当重提一些观点也无大碍（甚至不介意日后继续这样做），看过我此前作品的读者还请多多包涵。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
日本作为工业强国之一，其文具产业量成熟而发达，诸多文具品牌都有百年以上的品牌历史，从早期的仿制和借鉴，到如今堪称原创程度极高、做工精巧细致、设计富有灵感和生活趣味，外观符合现代审美，因而被大家所深深喜欢。
本篇将从品牌+代表现产产品介绍两方面，来和大家详细讲讲日系文具的趣味与实用属性。
国誉

国誉是一家综合的办公类设备供应商，创立于1905年，有极其丰富的文具产品生产线和办公家具产品供应。创始人黑田善太郎先生以封面纸起家，逐步发展成大型纸质品品牌，进而扩展到其它类别文具和家具行业。近年来也收购了多家国内企业，在我国建厂生产文具产品。
购买国誉，还是要以他们的纸品、本册最为代表！
国誉活页本

国誉的活页本堪称是头号招牌，也是率先把活页本灵活收纳+书写的概念引入国内的学生群体，活页结构耐用，多种封面可选，后期还有不硌手的活页结构推出，非常成熟的代表作。

除了结构上的优势，国誉Campus的内页纸质也是非常优秀的存在，设计有不同划线、结构的内页，并且日本进口原纸可能完美双面书写hold住钢笔。
国誉Campus笔记本

不习惯使用活页本的话，可以选择Campus系列下的笔记本，同样使用进口原纸，书写感受和活页本等同，完全hold住各种墨水~
需要注意不要买成国誉子品牌Gambol系列，那个完全国产，虽然价格低，但不如Campus。
国誉自我手账

除了日用向的本子，国誉的自我手账是简易入手账坑的不错产品，有简约耐看的外皮和丰富的内页，可以很好得记录生活~
每年一本，价格不贵~
国誉对开笔袋

极简设计的国誉笔袋也是品牌的热门款，拉链质感非常出色，设计简约耐看，适合中学生和办公一族！除了基础款，国誉还有些立式变形笔袋，基本都可以做到好用且耐用，值得推荐！
国誉空气弹力剪刀

国誉的这款剪刀也是站内神器之一，刃口锋利而耐用，所谓空气弹力是在握持位置增加了两个内握柄，使用感…]]></summary>

七月中旬，我坐在拥挤的旅游大巴上，驶出深圳湾口岸前往隔离酒店。不知道是不是因为空调开得不够大以至于空气有点闷热，我的心情也有些沉闷，全然没有回家的兴奋。其实真要想，原因也很明了，因为自己在香港找工作的尝试失败了。
这篇文章可能会和其他的经验总结有些不一样，因为我是站在一个失败者的角度来回顾和思考这一路上得到的经验教训。为了让自己的尝试有所价值，思考再三，我决定写下这篇文章，希望能帮助有留港工作意愿的朋友。

受访者对于 2021 年香港就业前景看法趋负面（来源）
专业选择
我认为找工作是否成功包括两个衡量标准：

能不能找到自己想要的工作；
找到的工作在待遇、行业前景、个人发展空间等方面符不符合预期。

我相信主观能动性的力量，但是一个人的成功，除了个人的奋斗，还需要考虑其他的客观因素。我认为找工作并不是从投递简历时才开始，甚至不是准备简历的时候开始的。很大程度上，一个人从事的职业在选择所学专业以及选择学习内容的时候就开始逐渐被决定了，甚至无论最后从事的工作和学习的内容有没有直接的联系。
如果所学专业能更好地匹配当地市场环境和当时大背景的需求，那么找工作确实会显得事半功倍。香港作为一个外向型经济为主导的转口贸易港，如果想要留港工作，那么那些和「钱」字沾边的专业：金融、…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[历史长河的锚点
近段期间《梦华录》热播，我在豆瓣上看到网友“黄小胖”吐槽说，“感觉《梦华录》的制作方确实不完全理解北宋官制。”比如顾千帆的父亲说“你十八岁中进士，要是好好干，现在也是个翰林学士了。”事实上翰林学士官职极高，30岁左右的顾千帆正常情况下距离翰林学士还有很远的距离。
《梦华录》
同样的，顾千帆“兴平军节度使，参知政事，知苏州事”的父亲，这个“知苏州事”并不一定主政苏州。顾千帆父亲的历史原型可能是丁谓，有一段时间官名为持节苏州诸军事，苏州刺史，这些都不是实际岗位，都是他实际官名平江军节度使的自然延伸。换言之，丁谓当时应该在南京工作，而不是苏州。
这名网友后来也感叹说：“《梦华录》的编剧就和我们这些普通观众一样，没有明白北宋阶官的制度，望文生义，认为苏州刺史就是苏州的官员，皇城副使就是皇城司的领导。这也是难免的，感觉只有专业人才能弄明白。”这名网友曾经对北宋奇特的官制产生了兴趣，在豆瓣友邻的鼓励下断断续续读了一些科普书籍。那么问题来了，有哪些能打通两宋与当下，专业与科普的书籍呢？或许《在田野看见宋朝》就是其中一本。包伟民先生在本书引言中，就诚恳地认为学术研究应当“走出‘专业’的圈子，以使历史知识能够走近更多的读者”。
《在田野看见宋朝》，包伟民等著，浙江古籍出版社2022年8月出版。图源：浙江古籍出版社微信公众号
就我个人而言，这本书之所以吸引我，在于提供了历史长河的锚点。这锚点，可以是距离我家不远的忠亭，可以是我多次穿越而过的鼓楼，可以是陆游的“深巷明朝卖杏花”，也可以是王安石在鄞县（今宁波）的新政实验。刘成国先生评价王安石时说：“所谓参天之木，必有其根；怀山之水，必有其源。”今天杭州背后的江南韵味、世代匠心，很大程度上来自两宋，而我们借助“锚点”回望两宋，也自有一股独特趣味。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大部分的官方路由固件是功能、驱动固化后编译出来的，那自然缺点也很明显，很多第三方插件能提供的内容就不能用；饿，个人如果想要通过路由器实现更多功能和玩法，就只能借助于类似OpenWRT、Padavan这些第三方开源固件了。OpenWRT的框架化设计和包管理模式使用户有了完全的定制能力，国内很多软路由固件也都是基于OpenWRT深度开发的。

为了解决内网设备的各种需求，就需要这些插件来支持了。我们有两种方法：第一个是主路由更换为软路由或者支持开源固件的硬路由；另一个就是添加一台支持开源固件的路由器，将其作为旁路路由使用。不过现在是千兆接入，一个支持2.5G及以上WAN口的旗舰硬路由，价格完全够搞台软路由的价格了，所以添置旁路路由是更合算过渡方案。

1.第一次升级：两台硬路由的旁路由化尝试
这次选择了GL.inet的两台支持OpenWRT的小路由：MT1300和SFT1200。SFT1200算是MT1300的SoC国产化后的一个低配版，二者使用了同样的模具设计，仅有颜色不同。

所以二者的一致性还是很高的，同样都是一个千兆WAN口、两个千兆LAN口，有一个USB-A接口，同样都通过USB-C接口供电。

不过SFT1200精简掉了网口的指示灯，并且USB-A的规格也降到了2.0，供电接口同样是使用的USB-C。

另外就是SFT1200取消了TF卡槽，只能够通过USB接口进行存储扩展。MT1300的插槽标注支持128G，实测200G的卡的还是可以正确识别的。

另一侧的模式选择与Reset按键，没有进行改动，二者这侧没有区别。

在外观以外，MT1300的处理器是联发科MT7261A，32+256MB配置；SFT1200的处理器是矽昌SF19A2890，双128配置。不过二者差价在百元左右，这些差异倒也可以接受。

上电待路由器完全启动后，我们就可以连接对应的Wi-Fi了。M…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我前几天无聊在刷哔哩哔哩的时候，看到一个很吸引人的标题「充电，拓展，储存一步到位」，点进去看原来是一家创业公司 X-STATION 发布了一个名字叫「Cyberize 玲珑坞」充电头。看完宣传片后我直呼好家伙，表面上是 GaN 氮化镓 65W 快充头，背地里却偷偷给你最高 1TB 存储，还附带拓展坞和 HDMI 投屏功能，这是什么周星驰行为？
我平时就喜欢折腾一些奇奇怪怪的东西，这玩意儿还能解决出门带上一堆乱七八糟东西的麻烦，自然跑不掉我的欲（划掉）愿望清单，赶紧弄了个回来体验一下。在体验了一周多之后我想说：
坏消息 —— 是个缝合怪；
好消息 —— 全缝上了。

PS：先声明没有恰饭，纯粹是自己的体验，然后已经了解简单情况和基础参数的朋友，可以直接跳到后面的日常使用场景体验和玩法部分，看看有没有你心动的场景。

过一遍外观和简单参数
虽然说充电头也不太容易长成惊世骇俗的模样，但我们还是先来简单看看外观和一些参数。
我拿到手的配件非常简单，就充电头，收纳包还有一条线（买手机不送充电头，买充电头居然送收纳包，十分不环保哈哈），收纳包的质感非常像耳机收纳包，不能说毫不相干，只能说一模一样。
充电头和配件
首次上手玲珑坞给我的感觉就是很轻巧，居然比 OPPO 自带的快充头还轻，重量大概就和小米送的 30W 快充头差不多（99g）。而且大小也是很正常的充电头大小（663CM），仅仅比小米送的 30W 充电头大一点点，和普通 100W GaN 快充头差不多大小，要知道玲珑坞里面还塞了一个固态硬盘和 HDMI 头，这个体积和重量控制还是可以的。另外两个充电脚也是直角收纳设计，不像普通充电头还要突出两个充电脚，进一步减少体积方便收纳。
与不同充电头和固态硬盘大小的对比
另外玲珑坞还自带三个不同颜色的橡胶圈让你套在充电头中间，非常有效防止你财力雄厚买了很多个，然后不小心把装着老师作品的充电…]]></summary>
