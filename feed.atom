Whether you're a Developer or SRE or DevOps - when you're tasked with setting up logging, there are essentially two options:
Setup an indexing based search engine, masquerading as log storage. Such products are difficult to deploy and run in longer term - manage indexes, local and remote storage, different node types and so on. 
Additionally, indexing in the ingestion flow causes high CPU and Memory consumption, while denying very high ingestion rates.
Alternatively, pay for an exorbitantly costly SaaS platform that is very easy to get started with. As time grows, data volumes and costs increase. 
But data gravity means getting out of this platform is difficult and you end up storing a fraction of log data to save costs. 
We dealt with both these options in our work and we know both these options are not ideal. This pushed us to think what would a modern, cloud native, log storage and observability platform look like.
It is clear that log storage of future won't be another index based search engine in a new language.
We set out to build a completely indexing free log storage platform. This led to Parseable.
Parseable is a simple, efficient and fast log storage and observability platform. Think the simplicity of Prometheus but for Logs. Written in Rust, Parseable leverages Apache Arrow, Parquet and widely available object storage platforms for efficiency, cost effectiveness and performance.
It is compatible with standard logging agents like FluentBit, LogStash etc. Parseable also offers a builtin, intuitive GUI for log query and analysis.

As we launched Parseable, we see tremendous interest in the community to try this out. We'd love for you to try out Parseable and we're all ears for any questions, feedback, and comments.

OpenAI is letting users of its AI art generator program DALL-E edit images with human faces. This feature was previously off-limits due to fears of misuse, but, in a letter sent to DALL-E’s million-plus users, OpenAI says it’s opening up access after improving its filters to remove images that contain “sexual, political, and violent content.” 
The feature will let users edit images in a number of different ways. They can upload a photograph of someone and generate variations of the picture, for example, or they can edit specific features, like changing someone’s clothing or hairstyle. The feature will no doubt be useful to many users in creative industries, from photographers to filmmakers.

Apple says it will increase App Store prices across Europe and in some Asian markets next month as currencies weaken against the strong US dollar. The price increases will effect both in-app purchases and regular apps on the App Store starting on October 5th.
All countries using the Euro, Sweden, South Korea, Chile, Egypt, Malaysia, Pakistan, Vietnam, and Japan will be affected by the price hikes. All Euro markets, except Montenegro, will see the base €0.99 app pricing move to €1.19 next month, a 20 percent jump. In Japan the hikes are more than 30 percent, amid the yen dropping to a new 24-year low against the US dollar.

First thing first we didn't have any APIs/project documentation, no unit/E2E tests and the whole project was in vanilla JavaScript. This problem caused an initial week of study of the code base and the domain.
This application was based on Next.js so with Server Side Rendering (SSR) architecture and this was another big mistake we noticed. As I mentioned before this application is for back-office users (not public available) so we didn't enjoy all the features of a SSR (SEO, etc. etc.) and we were struggling with slow page transitions, complex caching and server cost.
React


We decided to migrate the project to React + Vite because Next.js framework is based on top of React ecosystem. 
Usually, we load the information to render through APIs so a good tip is to start JavaScript -> TypeScript conversion from them. With this first step, the rest of the work can be trivial.
Here are some results of this refactoring:
it's cheaper because it's hosted a cloud Storage
less exception in production (❤️ TypeScript)
35% faster than its predecessor (smaller bundle size)
CI/CD pipeline is 50% faster 🚀 
the code base is easy to navigate and it's easier to implement new features
It was a long journey anyway benefits are massive.
I hope this article inspires you, don't forget to give ❤️ if you like it. Bye 👋]]></summary>

Even when users tell YouTube they aren’t interested in certain types of videos, similar recommendations keep coming, a new study by Mozilla found.
Using video recommendations data from more than 20,000 YouTube users, Mozilla researchers found that buttons like “not interested,” “dislike,” “stop recommending channel,” and “remove from watch history” are largely ineffective at preventing similar content from being recommended. Even at their best, these buttons still allow through more than half the recommendations similar to what a user said they weren’t interested in, the report found. At their worst, the buttons barely made a dent in blocking similar videos.

The inxi command is licensed with the GPLv3, and many Linux distributions include it. According to its Git repository: "inxi strives to support the widest range of operating systems and hardware, from the most simple consumer desktops, to the most advanced professional hardware and servers."
Documentation is robust, and the project maintains a complete man page online. Once installed, you can access the man page on your system with the man inxi command.

Technology is a little famous for coming up with "buzzwords." Other industries do it, too, of course. "Story-driven" and "rules light" tabletop games are a big thing right now, "deconstructed" burgers and burritos are a big deal in fine dining. The problem with buzzwords in tech, though, is that they potentially actually affect your life. When somebody calls an application "secure," to influence you to use their product, there's an implicit promise being made. "Secure" must mean that something's secure. It's safe for you to use and trust. The problem is, the word "secure" can actually refer to any number of things, and the tech industry often uses it as such a general term that it becomes …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你用过人工智能写作工具吗？前两个月，我看到了一些AI写作工具推出了文章续写功能。

只要你写上一篇文章的开头和结尾，智能系统就能自动生成一篇完整的文章。虽然现在技术还不成熟，积累的样本数据还不够完善，写出的内容还是会被挑剔，但是我总感觉排布好内容逻辑是迟早的事情。
在那个时候，AI就能代替我们写作吗？
作为内容创作者，我们还有活路吗？现在能帮人进行AI写作的工具有很多，从媒体报道、工作汇报这些角度看，人工智能会逐步替代人工写作。它只追求客观报道和逻辑推导，但无法完成偏主观价值判断的内容生产，因为AI不能代替的是我们对内容的「审美」。
人工智能与审美
前段时间AI绘画掀起了一阵火热，只要输入一些文字和句子，表达画的风格和内容，AI就能自动生产出一副艺术作品。有的画真的能与大神媲美，吊打国内外大部分艺术工作者。但是，这里的问题是，这个作品从「点子」到「作品」之间，完全忽略了过程。
怎么判断一个作品已经做到最好了？还能不能更好？这一笔触能不能再调一调？那一个色块能不能再深一些？如果单独抠几个细节，那是调整，如果从头开始就抠细节，那就是「创作」。
AI写作能根据你前面写的一个词、一段话，自动生成出后面的句子和篇章，但是它对于一个真正想表达的人来说，生产出的段落总会让人差强人意，甚至因为一个字的误用就导致表达结果与表达目的南辕北辙。
说到底，AI写作只能成为我们的工具，是基于创作者的审美的工具。倘若作者的审美和沉淀不够，反而会出现被工具主导，甚至被代替的困境。如同普通人去使用AI绘画一样，对绘画细节失控，除了标题能自己把控，后面的笔触、构图、用色等细节都和自己无关。如果我们本身就懂绘画，那么还可以去微调，但当我们什么都不懂的时候，剩下的只有无尽的赞叹。通过AI生产出了一个远超自己能力范畴的作品，或者说，它远远超出了我们对作品的审美极限。所以，无法对它进行细节的判定。
就如同我们在写作…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[与其说双链是笔记软件，不如说他们是知识管理软件或思维工具。而这个认知上的错位便是导致目前双链饱受争议的原因之一。

双链是个伪概念？
双链笔记软件目前的争议不少，大家对其的批判也非常实际，可谓是针针见血：

双链的底层逻辑尚未普及，用户无所适从。链接有什么用？哪些应该链接？
notion、语雀、印象笔记都能一定程度上双向链接各种文章。虽然稍微简化了一些，但好像也能用啊。
界面太“硬核”了，不优雅，不美观，基本没有办法给别人看。
没有办法共享和协作。
导出十分麻烦，有时候还要靠插件。
各种命令、快捷键、插件，学习成本高。
代码程度较高，没有代码基础的人被劝退。
知识图谱功能基本只是用来装逼，东西一多基本没法看。

可以发现，当我们以“笔记软件”的角度来看待双链，它和目前各种成熟的笔记软件相比差太多了。看着甚至像尚未完成就拿出来给人用的Alpha版本软件，非常粗糙，体验极差。
但是，如果我们换一个视角，以“知识管理软件”和“思维工具”的角度来看待双链，结果可能会完全不同。而我认为这才是双链的核心优势。
双链的核心优势——知识管理和思维辅助工具
1、信息颗粒度更细，便于细化和延展
个人认为，信息粒度是双链笔记最核心的优势。比起印象笔记以"篇"为单位、notion以“块”为单位，双链笔记是以“点”为单位。这就以为着，我们可以将大块的知识细化为一个个相对独立的知识点。同时，在细化的过程中，我们逐渐把各个知识点从原有的语境中解放（抽象）出来，进而形成能够在长时间的考验下保留下来的知识。这样，当日后遇到新的情景的时候，我们也能迅速知识结构，以支持新的目标。

具体而言，以roam research为例，在使用过程中，你任何时候都可以用 [[]] 来关联另一个概念或者页面，或用 (()) 来关联一个句子或一个块。
2、记录成本低
大部分双链笔记都是基于大纲笔记的，即整体的框架类似于bull…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这篇文章将介绍，我为什么以及如何将自动化数据处理应用到 Notion 当中。并通过我实际的案例，介绍自动化工具 Zapier 的用法，分享我的使用体验。
过多的数据更新和维护，让 Notion 的使用体验变得糟糕
随着 Notion 功能的不断完善，越来越多的人会选择使用 Notion 作为自己的第二大脑。无论是构建个人的知识网络、保存整理数据信息、还是展示自己的数字世界的成就，这些场景中，Notion 提供的功能都显得游刃有余。此外，得益于 Notion 可以高度个人定制化以及提供在线编辑的特性，用 Notion 管理待办事项，规划日程，同步团队信息，乃至于记账、写博客这种更进阶的用法，使用 Notion 都可以让数据为用户服务，一切变得井井有条。
但是，所谓凡事有一利就有一弊。在 Notion 当中构建的精巧且复杂的数据库，不仅意味着数据在展示层面上的美观和应用层面上的便利，同时也意味着需要在数据的更新维护上花更多的时间和精力。
按照我自己的使用习惯，我在 Notion 当中搭建了任务管理的数据库和财务管理的数据库。这其中有着大量的数字格式的数据存储在其中。但是因为 Notion 当中并不支持直接将数据进行运算得出结果
例如，数字一栏记录的值是 100，并不能通过直接填写 「+10」得到 110，数字数据的更新是需要删除原有的数据，并把计算好的新结果填入原来的位置。
数据更新的痛点
在 PC 端或网页端，这样的操作还勉强可以接受，但是在手机的 App 上，这样的操作就显得过于麻烦。更不要提在记账这个应用情境中，为了追求及时、准确且无遗漏的余额显示，我通常会在付款之后就立刻更新数据。因此总是在这种时候，会在繁琐的操作当中，倍感抓狂。
不仅是操作上的繁琐，更重要的在于，如果我们把使用 Notion 数据库记录、更新、回顾数据，进而改变自己行为模式的过程视作一个 PDCA 循…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Penpot 是一个自由开源的解决方案，能够替代 Figma 或类似的设计工具。你怎么看？




Adobe 以高达 200 亿美元的价格收购了流行的设计工具 Figma。

像往常一样，大型科技公司通过收购企业来消除竞争。因此，这并不完全是一个令人兴奋的消息。

但是，令人兴奋的是，我们遇到了一个自由开源的设计工具，它从 Figma 中获得灵感并且做得更好！

Penpot：正在开发中的自由开源的设计工具



Penpot enpot 是一个正在积极开发的开源项目。将近两年前，它在 ProductHunt 上推出，目前处于测试阶段。

Penpot 值得关注的地方：


自由开源（当然）。

可以选择自托管。

跨平台。

使用 SVG 作为原生格式。

基于 Web。

具有行业标准功能（受 Figma 启发）。


你可以观看其官方视频以了解其基础知识：




Penpot 的主要亮点是使用 SVG 作为其原生格式。使用 SVG 文件，你可以获得与许多矢量图形编辑工具很好的兼容性。

因此，你保存下来的文件，同样可以被其他的图片编辑软件打开，而不会被其专有的格式锁定在一个特定的软件上。

Penpot 为你提供绝对最佳的开放标准。

Penpot 的 CEO，Pablo Ruiz-Múzquiz 提到了更多：


如果你在存储层面上采用 SVG（开放标准，支持 Web，移动互联网等），你马上就可以将你所有的 Penpot 设计与你的代码库整合起来。由于采用了 SVG 而不是另一种封闭的格式，你可以对设计本身的实际表现进行修改。这为设计师和开发人员打开了巨大的机会之门。另外，SVG 意味着我们免费地就为低代码提供了支持。你可以在 Penpot 中选择任何元素并查看它的 SVG（和 CSS）形式，知道它实际上是什么，无需翻译。这给设计师和开发人员之间带来了更值得信赖的关系，并允许前端开发人员尝试他们的设计技能。


所以，使用 SVG 作为原生格式有很多优势！

目前，该项目处于测试阶段，且在项目中有大量熟练的贡献者不断改进。

这可以让它变成 Figma 最有用的开源替代品，让设计工具突破了大型技术公司。

你可以自行托管它或使用云应用程序对其进行测试。在其官方网站上注册以学习和试验它。

你还可以查看其 GitHub 页面 以探索更多信息。


Penpot


这也让我想起了 Akira，它的目标是成为一个用于 UI 和 UX 设计的原生 Linux 应用程序。它仍处于早期开发阶段，但当涉及 Linux 或开源计划时，这种努力总是受到赞赏。

💬 你如何看待 Penpot 作为 Figma 的开源替代品？

据 Duality 技术公司的新闻稿，谷歌已将其在 GitHub 上开源的使用 XLS SDK 开发的开源项目完全同态加密（FHE）转译器与领先的开源完全同态加密fully homomorphic encryption库 OpenFHE 合并。通过使加密知识更简单、更容易接近，开发者对 FHE 的采用将增加。

这类称为 FHE 的加密技术不同于更常见的加密技术，因为它可以直接对加密数据进行计算，而无需密钥。一个由知名密码学家组成的社区创建了 OpenFHE，这是一个根深于后量子开源晶格密码学的加密库。

该库旨在实现最佳可用性、增强的 API、模块化、跨平台可移植性，以及与硬件结合时的项目加速器。开发人员可以通过将 OpenFHE 与谷歌的转译器结合起来，使用高级代码来操作加密数据，例如经常用于未加密数据的 C++，而不需要学习密码学。

谷歌的转译器简化了使用 FHE 驱动的应用程序的过程，而无需目前从头开始构建 FHE 所需的广泛的软件开发专业知识。这填补了软件设计人员和开发人员偶尔遇到的空白，他们希望从 FHE 的功能中受益，而不必经历那具有挑战性的学习曲线。

Duality 公司的密码学研究高级主管兼首席科学家 Yuriy Polyakov 补充说：“我们的团队通过我们的 OpenFHE 库达成了重要的里程碑，它已迅速成为当今许多技术领导者的选择，例如谷歌。谷歌转译器为那些非 FHE 专家的应用开发者社区提供了 OpenFHE 同态加密的最新技术。”

Microsoft is making it easier to play games on your Xbox Series X, even if it’s offline — as of the 2208 update released earlier this month, you won’t be forced to do an online compatibility check to play a game from an Xbox One disc (via Windows Central). Instead, you can just pop the disc in, install the game, and play; no internet connection required.
The change, which isn’t listed as a feature of the 2208 update on Microsoft’s site, was confirmed by Xbox engineering lead Eden Marie, who tweeted that the check was removed because it wasn’t necessary “in the vast majority of cases” when playing a cross-generation game on the Series X.

🤔 The problem we're solving 

As we watched gas prices climbing over the last many months, we wanted to do something to help people take back control of their fuel spending.
‍
When we looked at the data on FuelEconomy.gov (https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/...) we were surprised at just how much the way you drive impacts how much you spend on gas. By simply cutting back on aggressive driving - high speeds, braking and acceleration - you can save up to 40% on gas. That is way more than you can save by driving all over town to find the cheapest gas.

Most cars tell you your MPG, but they don't show you exactly how much money you could be saving by driving more efficientl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在正式开始说体验前，先谈谈索尼在 9 月初正式发布的全新真·小屏旗舰——Xperia 5 IV，在设计上融合了 Xperia 1 系列的特点，总算是更换了硬朗的边框以及磨砂质感的后盖玻璃，可以说完全契合个人的审美爱好，更不用说破天荒加入了无线充电，我对 Xperia 5 III 最不满意的两点都解决了，还有什么理由不买呢？加上最近在各种视频网站看到关于 Xperia 1 IV、5 III 等机器的吐槽，于是就想在 5 IV 到手前，和大家分享一下我的使用体验。
为何购买 Xperia 5 III
说起来在今年入手 5 III 之前，我在用的是三星 Galaxy S22 Ultra，S22U 真的什么都好，拍照、系统啥的我都挺满意，而且外观更是延续了曾经最爱的 Xperia XZ Premium 的神韵，当时一发售就冲了。只是在实际使用时，总会觉得这机器实在是太大了，单手用太累，可我又不像当年用黑莓 Passport 那样充满喜爱，对其体积无下限容忍，于是乎就又考虑换台趁手的小屏旗舰机器。
然后说起现在的小屏机器，基本上没得选，iPhone 就只有 SE 和 12、13 mini，Android 这边能看上眼的就是魅族 18、Galaxy S22 和 Xperia 5 III。综合来看，12、13 mini 因为刘海直接 pass，SE 电量实在担忧，魅族 18 不防水也 pass，只能让 5 III PK S22。作为一个曾经的 Xperia 5 用户，对于 5 III 可以说是完全不担心，唯一的问题就是臭名昭著的火龙 888，但 S22 用的是 8 Gen1，这对卧龙凤雏就随便吧，毕竟我都能接受 S22U 的 8 Gen1 了。最后特意跑去三星官方店实际上手体验 S22 的感觉，由于 S22 70.6mm 的宽度握持时有点撑手不舒服，于是乎 68mm 宽度的 Xperia…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“销售软盘的最后一人”

专注于销售和回收软盘的 Floppydisk.com 创始人 Tom Persky 自称是“该行业最后一人”。他早期的生意是软盘复制，在上世纪曾经兴盛一时，利润丰厚。但随着软盘的使用下降，他开始销售空白软盘，他如今是全球软盘的供应商。他说之所以还在销售软盘是他“忘记退出这个行业了”。他买下了数百万张空白软盘，然后靠着销售库存和回收软盘为生。他目前的库存大约还有 50 万张，包括 3.5 英寸、5.25 英寸 和 8 英寸等不同尺寸的软件。


消息来源：aiga



老王点评：其实才二十年，软盘已经销声匿迹了（除了日本之外）。我觉得，现在或许是收藏一些这个“3D 打印的保存图标”的时候了。




Chrome 的增强拼写检查会将你的表单数据传递到谷歌

一家 JavaScript 安全公司称，当用户手动激活 Chrome 的增强拼写检查功能和 Edge 的微软编辑器的拼写和语法检查器时，实际上是将你的表单数据发送到谷歌或微软。而你在表单中输入的数据可能包括个人身份信息、住址、电子邮件、信用卡号码等等机密信息。如果启用“显示密码”，甚至会将你的密码发送出去。这两种浏览器都有自己的默认启用的基本拼写检查器，它们不会构成安全风险，因为它们的行为与增强功能不同。


消息来源：Bleeping Computer



老王点评：很显然，“增强”的拼写检查需要服务器端的处理，自然会将你的输入传输到服务器上。类似的，现在云输入法，也会将你的输入事无巨细地传输到别人的服务器上。




Arm 高管称 RISC-V 在数据中心领域算不上竞争对手

在近日召开的新闻发布会上，Arm 高管承认，RISC-V 确实带来了一些竞争压力。但他说，“虽然 RISC-V 自 2010 年以来就有了，但最近才进入商业产品。”Arm 公司的另外一位高管称，“我们真的不认为 RISC-V 现在或在不久的将来是我们在数据中心领域的重要竞争对手。”他认为 RISC-V 更适合于小众或专业应用。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：就像当年的 Linux 一样，谁能想到它能干倒 Unix 和 Windows 服务器呢？我看好 RISC-V 未来的发展，这或许要不了几年。]]></summary>

Before this, I had been introduced to open source many times, told about its importance in the tech space, and even attended open source conferences (e.g., OSCAFest). I had all the instant excitement to start, but imposter syndrome set in on opening GitHub to create something.
Fast forward to Monday, the 8th of August, 2022, when I watched Bolaji's video on contributing to open source. I felt pumped again, but I wanted to apply what I learned, so I noted some steps.
The steps:

Hot take: PyLint is actually good!
"PyLint can save your life" is an exaggeration, but not as much as you might think! PyLint can keep you from really really hard to find and complicated bugs. At worst, it can save you the time of a test run. At best, it can help you avoid complicated production mistakes.
The good
I'm embarrassed to say how common this can be. Naming tests is perpetually weird: Nothing cares about the name, and there's often not a natural name to be found. For instance, look at this code:
def test_add_small():
# Math, am I right?
assert 1 + 1 == 3
def test_add_large():
assert 5 + 6 == 11
def test_add_small():
assert 1 + 10 == 11

The test works:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我是一个拥有七年工龄的年过三十的打工人，base在北京。
工作的前五年，我任职于一家外企。凭借着年轻和朝九晚六，工作的大多数时候我都能轻松应付，并没有把运动当回事儿。工作五年后我跳槽到了互联网行业，工作强度和工作时长陡增，对体力和精力都有了新的考验，因此运动也不得不提上了日程。
但是运动这件事只有想法是没办法做成的，我花了一年多的时间断断续续走了很多弯路。三天打鱼两天晒网经常发生，一下子荒废半个月的情况也并不少见。而最终让我养成运动习惯的是我狠下心氪金，配齐了各种运动辅助工具，并在各种工具的综合作用下，让运动成为了我生活习惯。
此文写作时间为2022年9月19日，我刚刚收到了Apple Watch发送给我的“最坚持奖-22天”的奖章。一个习惯的养成需要21天，这个奖章也让我动了念头，想把这个过程分享出来，于是就有了这篇文章。
2022年9月19日 收到最坚持奖 22天
我的典型一天-工作日运动
【时间选择】
工作日大家都疲于奔命，很难抽出大块时间来专门运动。所以选择适合自己的运动时间很重要。
我首先尝试的是下班后跟着Keep App来做一些运动。但是遇到了两个阻碍：一个是下班时间不固定，有时候到家已经九点多了，不方便再做剧烈运动，会直接影响睡眠质量；另一个是有时候晚饭吃了比较多的主食，所以整个人头昏脑胀的，大多数时候只想躺着刷剧，并没有意志力再爬起来。
然后我尝试了在中午的时间运动。我会早十五分钟锁定电脑屏幕赶去健身房，并点好一个定时派送的外卖（运动完后食堂已经关门）。这样实行了快半年时间，也遇到了两个小问题：有时候上午会有会议拖堂，导致整个运动计划没办法按时执行；长期以来点外卖，的确不如食堂吃饭营养健康，而且还花钱更多。
最后我选择了更早起床，把运动时间放在了吃饭前的早上。这样做有如下三个原因：一是互联网公司相对上班时间较晚，因此早上运动属于错峰，健身房人少，且不会影响到…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我想我们都同意，Firefox 是 Linux 的最佳浏览器 之一。

而且锦上添花的是，你可以用一些扩展来提高你的浏览体验! 也许甚至可以将 Facebook 隔离在容器中？😉

在我推荐一些优秀的 Firefox 浏览器扩展之前，让我给你一些提示。

安装 Firefox 扩展前须知

我们都知道的一件事是 盲目地安装浏览器扩展可能是极其有害的。那么如何确定浏览器扩展是否可以安全使用？

由于本文是关于 Firefox 扩展的，我们将重点放在 Firefox 的市场（获取扩展的官方渠道）。

虽然没有什么是 100% 安全的，但有几件事可以检查：




扩展的徽章：寻找“推荐”或“By Firefox”徽章；忽略包含警告徽章/图标的扩展。

菜单和评论：虽然仅此一项并不能提供太多保证，但这是你可以在其他方面考虑的一件事。此外，关注评论的数量可以帮助你了解它在用户中是否足够受欢迎。

扩展的权限：某些扩展需要诸如“访问浏览器标签页”、“导航时访问浏览器动作”等权限。记下这一点并确定你对哪些权限的舒适程度。

最后更新日期：有时，即使是优秀的、知名的扩展也不会更新。这没关系，但对于像密码管理器、广告拦截器这样的扩展来说，这很重要。应始终谨慎使用超过 2 个月没更新的扩展。

扩展发布者：始终确保扩展的发布者是你信任的人，或者已经发布了你信任的扩展。


话虽如此，让我们来看看一些可以改善你的网络浏览体验的扩展。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[起初，我从未感受到我妈对于衰老的恐惧。直到大概五六年前我家重新装修房子的时候，我妈坚持要在他们卧室的厕所里装一个马桶，后来问了原因才知道，她大概是觉得以后自己老了，万一腿脚不方便了，用马桶会轻松很多。从那一刻起，我才猛然发觉这种隐秘的恐惧。
第七次全国人口普查的的数据显示，目前中国60岁及以上的人口数量已超2.6亿，这个人数占总人数的18.7%。这就意味着，有相当一部分老人正在经历着这种关于衰老的隐秘恐惧，还会有越来越多的人陷入这种关于衰老的恐惧。
为了回应这些恐惧，很多人可能最先想到的是“适老化改造”。当然，适老化改造是一个相当大的问题域，本文目前所要探讨的仅仅是房屋的适老化改造，特别是对现有的城镇房屋进行一些“修补性”的适老化改造。
为什么要进行房屋适老化改造？
我们需要先回答一个问题：为什么我们要率先对“房屋”这样一个区域进行适老化改造呢？这个问题的答案有很多。
首先是出于目前国内养老格局的考虑。国内养老事业呈现出一种所谓的“9073”的格局。也就是说，90%左右的老年人居家养老，大约7%的老年人需要依托社区进行养老，最后3%左右的老年人将入住养老院。这意味着大多数老人会在自己的家中度过大部分的晚年时光。这几乎是最适合老人，同时也是最经济的养老方式。
其次是出于老人活动范围的考虑。随着年龄的增长，老人的社会活动范围会逐渐缩小，老人对于居住空间的依赖程度也会越来越高。这意味着，居住环境成为老人晚年生活最重要的空间载体，居住条件的好坏将会直接影响老人的生活质量。[1]
再次是出于老年人人体工学的考虑。据老年人人体工学的研究，在衰老过程中人体的尺寸也会发生变化。医学研究资料显示：人在28-30岁时身高最高，35-40岁之后逐渐出现衰减，70岁时身高会比年轻时减少2.5%-3%。[2]这就意味着，随着居住者年龄的增长，房屋也应该发生一些改变。
所以，出于上述的种种原因，除了大…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在开始编写应用之前，为手机、物联网设备和边缘计算定义无线更新计划。


过去对系统的更新相对简单。当开发人员需要修改他们已经分发给公众的东西时，会发布一个更新程序供人们运行。用户将运行更新程序，允许用新文件替换旧文件并添加新文件。然而，即使有了这些“相对简单”的更新，也有一个问题。当用户安装好的系统处于意外状态时会发生什么？升级中断时会发生什么？当各种设备都在线时，这些问题同样重要，有时需要重要的安全更新。今天的许多更新都是通过无线、空中下载技术over-the-air（OTA）的方式提供的，连接不良、信号突然丢失或断电的可能性可能会对应该是次要更新的内容造成灾难性的影响。这些是你在计划提供 OTA 更新时需要考虑的三大策略。

1、验证

TCP 协议内置了很多验证功能，因此当你 向设备发送数据包 时，通常可以确信每个数据包都已完好无损地收到。但是，TCP 无法报告它不知道的错误，因此由你来验证以下内容：


你是否已发送更新所需的所有文件？设备无法接收没有发送的内容。

收到的文件和你发送的文件一样吗？至少，检查 SHA 和以验证文件完整性。

如果可能，请使用 数字签名 确保文件来自受信任的来源。

在允许更新开始之前，你必须验证设备能够应用更新。在提交更新之前检查权限和电池状态，并确保你的更新过程覆盖任何意外的用户事件，例如计划的重新启动或休眠。

最后，你必须验证声称已成功完成的更新是否已实际完成。在将更新正式标记为系统已完成之前，请检查目标设备上的文件位置和完整性。


2、回退和故障状态

更新的最坏情况是设备处于损坏状态，以至于它甚至不能继续被中止的更新。在这种情况下，更新程序文件存在于目标设备上，但该过程已被中断。这可能会使设备处于未知状态，其中一些文件已被更新版本替换，而其他文件尚未被替换。在最坏的情况下，已更新的文件与尚未更新的文件不兼容，因此设备无法按预期运行。

有一些策略可以解决这个问题。初始更新步骤可能是安装专用于完成更新的特殊引导镜像或环境，并在系统上设置“标志”以确认更新正在进行中。这样可以确保即使设备在更新过程中突然断电，更新过程也会在下次启动时重新启动。仅在验证更新后才删除表示更新成功的标志。

根据目标设备的安全策略和你要更新的内容，特殊的引导镜像可能不可行或不需要。不过，原理还是一样的。当启动后，更新必须建立一个环境，在这个环境中，待处理的更新是解决问题之前的唯一途径

但是，在更新被授予启动权限之前，用户（如果有的话）应该能够延迟或忽略更新。

3、附加更新

在许多边缘和物联网设备中，目标设备的底层是不可变的。更新只会添加到系统的已知状态。 Fedora Silverblue 之类的项目正在证明这种模式可以在许多领域发挥作用，因此这种奢侈的做法可能会变得司空见惯。不过，在那之前，成功应用更新的一部分是了解你将要影响的环境。

不过，你不需要不可变的核心来应用附加更新。你可以构建一个使用相同概念的系统，将更新作为添加库或包的一种方式，而无需修改旧版本。作为此类更新的最后一步，具有更新路径的可执行文件是你所做的唯一实际修订。

OTA 更新

世界越来越无线化。对于手机、物联网设备和 边缘计算，OTA 更新通常是唯一的选择。实施 OTA 更新策略需要仔细规划并仔细考虑不可能的情况。你最了解你的目标设备，因此请在开始编码之前规划好你的更新架构。

捷克 3D 打印专家 Prusa Research 公司正在与模拟器开发商 Vrgineers 和英国的 Somnium Space 合作开发 Somnium VR ONE 头盔。这款产品可以连接或者独立使用，旨在尽可能地开放，来改变虚拟现实市场中受限的供应。

由于 Android 11 操作系统是一个开源的操作系统，其源代码是公开的，因此它将在不受限制的商业许可下出售。其中央处理单元是高通骁龙 XR2 CPU，支持 microSD 存储卡，并拥有 8GB 的LPDDR5 内存和 512GB UFS 闪存。

它采用新的 6 GHz 的 WiFi 6E 高带宽无线协议，而不是目前拥挤的 5GHz 和 2.4GHz WiFi频率，以实现更高的带宽和低延迟连接。它包括两个 3.2 英寸 2880RGB * 2880 快速液晶屏幕，具有 120 度水平视野和 100 度垂直视野。

它具有两个用于外部小工具的 USB-C 10 Gbit/s 链路，和一个 USB-C USB2.0 电池组（USB3.2 Gen2）。Somnium Space 与布拉格的 VRgineers 合作，在线销售电子产品和独有的镜头，使用户能够 3D 打印自己的头盔，此外，也会提供完整的头盔。

该企业于 2012 年在布拉格成立，已经拥有 700 多名员工。开源的 Prusa i3 design 是世界上使用最广泛的 3D 打印机，每月从布拉格直接向 160 多个国家运送超过 10000 台 Original Prusa 打印机。

合成训练环境Synthetic Training Environments（STE）是由捷克共和国的模拟器开发商 VRgineers 向企业和政府客户提供的。它创造了被称为 XTAL 的专业 8K 头盔，该头盔被 NASA、空客防务与航天公司和 BAE Systems 公司使用，目前在布拉格、布尔诺和拉斯维加斯拥有一支由 50 名专家组成的国际团队。

总部位于伦敦的 Somnium Space 是一个建立在区块链上的开放、社交和永久虚拟现实平台。由于其独特的 NFT 的去中心化经济，用户可以拥有、交易和交换数字商品而无需获得授权。它已经与高通公司和 Ultraleap 公司在 Lynx R-1 上进行了合作，这是一个独立的增强现实（AR）头盔设计。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI 机器人遇到“提示注入”攻击

研究人员发现了一种被称为“提示注入”的技术，可以将 AI 机器人重定向到重复令人尴尬和可笑的短语。一些推特用户在这个发现之后，劫持了一个在 GPT-3 语言模型上运行的自动推特机器人，从而导致该 AI 机器人被迫关闭。注入式攻击的概念并不新鲜，如 SQL 注入、XSS，但防御“提示注入”的困难来自于 AI 没有正式的语法，因而不像其他注入攻击那样纠正语法就能防御大部分攻击。


消息来源：ARS Technica



老王点评：我想，AI 或许很快就会“进化”出防御的能力。




Ubuntu 支持更多来自中国的 RISC-V 板卡

除了支持赛昉的昉·星光和全志的哪吒 RISC-V 板卡外，Canonical 工程师也在努力为下个月的 Ubuntu 22.10 添加更多的 RISC-V 板卡支持。他们正在为一款起价为 16.90 美元的 RISC-V 板卡 Sipeed Lichee RV 提供支持。它是一块带有 M.2 接口的计算模块板，可以连接到载体板。它使用全志 D1 SoC，采用单核玄铁 C906 64 位 RISC-V 处理器，运行频率仅为 1.0GHz。这是一块非常便宜但很慢的板卡，适用于物联网领域。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：看起来 Canonical 越来越重视 RISC-V 了，而且，中国的 RISC-V 厂商进展也不错。




Craigslist 的界面和 25 年前一样

分类广告网站 Craigslist 自 1995 年上线以来，其页面外观一直没有变化。其创始人称，对使用这个网站的用户来说，它简单又方便，这就足够了。他说作为一名工程师，简单就是美，实用就是美。Craigslist 总共只有 10 名员工，从事开发、客服和会记工作，没有任何人从事销售工作。


消息来源：PCMag



老王点评：你认同他的说法吗？我觉得还是懒 —— 不过话说也有一些人批评 Linux 中国好多年没改版的网站很丑。至于我们这么多年没改版的原因就不说了，我只能说新版就来了，就来了，只要小白不烂尾……]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用插件来赋予你的在线学习平台新的功能来激励学生。




无论在哪里，优秀的在线学习平台对于教育都非常重要。教师们需要一种途径来开办课堂，学生们需要一个友好的用户界面来促进学习，而管理者也需要一种方法来监控教育系统的有效性。

Moodle 是一个开源的软件包，允许你创建一个带有互动在线课程的私人网站。它可以帮助人们进行虚拟的在线聚会，互相教授和学习，并在此过程中保持井井有条。

Moodle 的独特之处在于它的该可用性，利用第三方解决方案可以显著提高可用性。如果你访问 Moodle 插件目录，你将会找到超过 1,700 种由开源社区开发的插件。

面对如此多的选择，为你的学员挑选出最好的插件可能是一个挑战。为了帮助你开始，这里是我挑选出来的五大插件，你可以将其添加到你的在线学习平台。

Level up!




Level up! 官网


激励和吸引学习者是教育工作者最困难的任务之一。Level up! 插件 允许你将学习体验游戏化，将积分分配给完成任务的学生，并显示进度和等级提升。这会鼓励你的学生在健康的氛围中竞争，并成为一个很好的学习者。

另外，你可以完全控制学生所获得的积分，并且他们可以在达到一定等级的时候解锁内容。所有的这些功能都是免费提供的。如果你考虑付费，你可以购买一些额外的功能，如个人奖励和团队排行榜。

BigBlueButton




BigBlueButton 官网


BigBlueButton 可能是最知名的 Moodle 插件。这个开源的视频会议解决方案使得教育者能够让学生远程参与实时在线课程和小组协作活动。它提供了一些重要的功能，例如：实时屏幕共享、音视频通话、聊天，发送表情和分组讨论室。这款插件还可以让你记录你的直播课程。

BigBlueButton 让你能够在任何课程中创建多个活动链接、限制你的学生在你加入之前加入会话、创建自定义欢迎消息、管理你的录音等等。总而言之，BigBlueButton 拥有你教授和参与在线课程所需要的一切。

ONLYOFFICE




ONLYOFFICE 官网


ONLYOFFICE 插件 允许学习者和教育者在他们的浏览器中直接创建和编辑文本文档、电子表格和演示文档。无需安装任何额外的应用程序，他们就可以处理附在课程中的 .docx、.xlsx、.pptx、.txt 和 .csv 文件；打开 .pdf 文件进行查看；并应用复杂格式和对象，包括自动形状、表格、图表、方程式等等。

此外，ONLYFFICE 使得实时共同编辑文件成为可能，这意味着几个用户可以同时在同一个文件上工作。不同的权限（完全访问、评论、审查、只读和填表）使你更容易灵活地管理对文档的访问。

Global Chat




Global Chat 官网


Global Chat 插件 允许教育者和学习者通过 Moodle 进行实时交流。该插件提供了你课程中所有用户的列表，当你点击一个用户的名字时，它会在页面底部打开一个聊天窗口，以便你们进行交流。

有了这个易于使用的工具，你不需要打开一个单独的窗口来开始在线对话。你可以在网页之间转换，而你的对话将始终保持开放。

Custom certificate




Custom certificate 官网


另一个吸引学生的有效方法是提供证书作为完成课程的奖励。颁发结业证书的承诺有助于保持学生的进度和对培训的承诺。

Custom certificate 插件 允许你在你的网页浏览器中生成完全可定制的 PDF 证书。重要的是，该插件与 GDPR 要求兼容，而且证书有独特的验证码，所以你可以用它们进行真实认证。

更多丰富的 Moodle 插件

这些是我最喜欢的五个 Moodle 插件。你可以通过在 Moodle.org 上 注册一个账户 来试用它们，或者你可以托管你自己的插件（或者与你的系统管理员或 IT 人员商量，为你设置一个托管环境）。

如果这些插件不符合你的学习目标，可以看看其他可用的插件。如果你找到一个好的插件，请留下评论并告诉大家。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linus Torvalds 让 Fedora Linux Workstation 36 成功运行在 Apple Macbook Air M2 上。666！




Linus Torvalds 喜欢写代码和修复代码。当然，这是他的技术专长。

如果你知道的话，他就是那个因为买不起 UNIX，转头就创造了 Linux 的家伙。

出于类似的原因，他还在 BitKeeper 不再免费使用后构建了 Git。

即使在今天，他仍继续着他的动手精神和“没有我解决不了的问题”的态度。

他设法在他的 Apple Macbook Air M2 上运行了 Fedora Linux 36 Workstation 版本。

注意：从 Asahi Linux 的 Hector Martin 那里得知，Linus Torvalds 似乎在这里使用了 Leif 的工具包。所以，你可能想多了，他并没有从头开始做所有事情来让它发挥作用。

多亏了 ZDNet 对 Torvalds 的 采访，我们才发现了这一激动人心的考验。

Apple M2 芯片上的 Fedora Linux

Apple Macbook Air 是一款出色的笔记本电脑。但是，它不能完全按照消费者想要的方式运行 Linux。

然而，Linus Torvalds 似乎是使 Linux 运行在苹果电脑上的天才。

尽管苹果基于 ARM 的 M2 芯片没有 Fedora 移植，但他还是做到了。

请注意，这并不意味着你可以立即在 Macbook Air M2 上运行 Fedora Linux。它只适合像 Torvalds 这样的 Linux 高手才能使其工作。

他说，即使没有图形加速和在 GNOME 桌面环境中缺少某些图形效果（例如屏幕调光），这种体验也很出色。


我喜欢这种方式，它使显示更加迅捷。我可能也会在我的其他机器上关掉这些。


事实上，总的来说，这是一项令人兴奋的成就！

Apple 芯片上 Linux 的现状

不仅是 Linus Torvalds，而且每个人都对 Apple M1/M2 芯片的性能印象深刻。

事实上，他利用 Macbook Air M2 发布了 Linux 内核 5.19。


Linus Torvalds 使用 Apple MacBook 硬件发布 Linux Kernel 5.19


尽管我们很想尝试一下，但 Apple 的 M2 还没有为 Linux 做好准备。

幸运的是，像 Asahi Linux 这样的项目一直在不断改进对 Apple 芯片的支持。他们还设法使 Linux 在最新的 Apple M2 芯片上运行。

而且，在 Linux 创造者的努力下，我们应该很快就能在 Macbook 上看到完整的 Linux 体验。

到目前为止，你可以使其与 Asahi Linux 一起使用，但对于大多数用户来说，它仍然无法取代它作为日常办公系统。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前些日子，我给你介绍了本地使用 Stable Diffusion 人工智能绘画工具的方法（如何在你的 M1/M2 Mac 本地运行 Stable Diffusion？）。不少小伙伴们反馈说玩儿得很开心。

不过也有不开心的，因为手头儿没有 M1/M2 的 Mac 电脑。

是不是因为设备限制，就只能眼巴巴看着别人体验新科技成果呢？
当然不是。人工智能技术的普及化，已经是科技发展的潮流趋势了。我今天给你介绍一个不需要安装任何应用的体验方式。而且，更好的消息是，你都不用把自己的想法翻译成英文了，直接输入中文就行。
这是个微信小程序，叫做「盗梦师」。开发者是西湖大学蓝振忠老师团队。
我这里给你做个演示。
今早我看到有人分享了一段视频，是喷气式背包的实验场景。很有意思。

于是我就在朋友圈发了一番感慨：

有了这玩意儿，上班堵车不是事儿了。

感慨之后，觉得光用文字表达不够形象，刚好就可以用「盗梦师」画出来。
于是我打开小程序，输入了这样一段话：

一个背着喷气式背包的中年人在交通拥堵的马路上轻松自在飞行

这里注意你可以选择绘画的类型。我选择的是「赛博朋克」，我觉得和主题很搭。

然后是选择画家风格。我对赛博朋克艺术家不了解，于是设置成为「不限定」。

下面还有一个选项，是画面的长宽比例。我觉得对于展示的画作来说， 16:9 感觉上比较好。
好了，做了这些设定后，就可以直接画了。

这里需要等上几秒钟即可，比本地 M1 Mac 运行起 Stable Diffusion 来快多了。画做好了，你感觉怎么样呢？

有了这样的形象画面，朋友圈里的评论一下子就丰富了起来，例如：

假发套得粘的紧一点

以及：

当姑娘们画好了妆，做好了头发，美美的在街上走着，然后突然被人用喷气背包的风吹乱的时候，你猜她们会不会捡石头把它打下来

我觉得，这些担心，都不无道理，值得背包开发商们认真记录和讨论。
如果你感兴趣的话，直接打开微信，搜索这个小程序试试看吧。上文图中也包含了二维码可以直达。目前阶段，每天有 5 次免费创作机会。然后每分享给一位好友，双方可以获得 20 次创作额度。
当然，我也尝试了一些其他的图画，例如中国风的「雪中山寺古钟」。

雪、山都齐全了，只是寺庙在哪里？找了半天没看到，哈哈。如果你玩儿过 Stable Diffusion ，应该知道很多时候你需要多画几张，从中选择更合适的图画。所以我准备等明天有了新的额度，再用同样的文本，多画几张对比看看。
欢迎把你的尝试结果和经验心得分享到留言区，咱们一起交流讨论。
祝人工智能绘画愉快！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[播客的形式和内容日益丰富，其中不乏一些可以与文章、视频媲美的信息价值和密度。我们会通过剪藏、截图来收集文字和图像，然而对于声音为媒介的播客，是否你也产生了“要是能把这段单独截出来就好了”的想法？
作为半个播客爱好者，我目前一直在使用 Spotify，无论是设备进度同步，还是UI交互，播客的基础功能都算基本满足，唯一遗憾是当听到精彩的片段时，没有裁剪和收藏片段的功能。
因此开始在市面上寻找这样的应用，我的需求算比较清晰，首先必须要有片段截取功能；其次需要能创建公开链接，无论用于分享朋友还是收集； 最后软件的播客功能需要能过得去，如果能跨平台也是加分项；
在市面上找了一轮，大体能满足要求的找到了三款，下面就通过比较 Snipd、Airr 和 QlipCast 三个播客应用，给有类似需求的读者做参考。
💡 喜马拉雅也包含片段截取的“卡擦”功能，但由于广告泛滥和部分内容限制，我个人不纳入考虑，不介意的朋友可以尝试喜马拉雅，从功能齐全、多端同步、网络稳定上都是较优选择，注意敏感内容即可。
   
具体比较
1、整体设计风格
Snipd 整体风格和 Spotify 相近，大线条的图标以及深蓝渐变和绿色的色彩；
Airr 界面简洁干净，主要以黑白交错为主，首层只有两个模块：第一个主要是看自己和他人分享的一些片段，第二块包含关注或订阅的播客、听过的节目和创建过的片段。
QilpCast 作为最近更新已经是两年前的软件，UI 虽无法媲美前两者，也还算得差强人意。
左：Snipd；中：Airr；右：QlipCast
2、片段创建和分享功能
这部分的功能可以说是我的需求核心，功能对比也聚焦在主要的操作流上，即：裁剪与创建片段→ 管理与编辑片段 → 分享/导出
💡 截取的片段名称在各软件叫法各异，Snip（Snipd），Quote（Airr）和 Qlip（QlipCast），为阅读理解便利，以…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[打算开一个新的系列「Obsidian 综述」，不同于「玩转 Obsidian」系列，「综述」更关注 Obsidian 的功能和插件的使用，而「玩转」系列更成体系，它们的区别：

综述系列重点在「介绍」，针对 Obsidian 近期的新功能、新插件、新主题进行体验。并在使用过一段时间之后，进行简单的介绍和归纳。
玩转系列重点在「方法论」，是在吃透了「综述」内容之后，结合自己的体验进行总结和提炼。

v0.16 重磅更新
最近 Obsidian 重磅发布了 v0.16 ，当然目前还属于「内部预览」版，只有付费支持的用户才能体验，不过大家也不用着急，通常「公开版」也不会等太久。
最大的升级是「重新设计了 Obsidian 的界面」带来了「标签组」等重磅功能，官方内部对这次新 UI 称为 Dragonglass（龙晶），从体验上看完全颠覆了从前我对 Obsidian 界面和易用性上的感知，贴几张个人使用的图大家感受一下：

这次 UI 升级是重头戏，本篇不会事无巨细的介绍所有升级点，我会挑选几条个人最满意的地方跟大家展开介绍，如果您想了解本次所有升级功能可以参考官方文档：

中文介绍
英文介绍

工作区支持「标签组」
本次升级引入了「标签组」概念，「标签组」简单理解，就像我们在「浏览器」上使用「标签组」一样，在 Obsidian 中通过多个「标签组」每个组多个「标签页」，可以较大限度的实现「平铺散列」的阅读方式，如图：
 

「标签组」的优势在于一方面我们可以通过快速切换「标签组」内的不同「标签页」，提高「信息摄入速度」；另一方面「标签组」也极大拓展了我们打开「笔记」的数量。这两点优势在「整理知识」和「创意输出」的时候非常有用。
在升级前我们只能采用「下图」中的方式打开多篇「笔记」，这种方式最大的问题是「最多同时可以看到 2篇笔记全貌」，如果想要看到更多需要将笔记拖拽到「中间区域」…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[小众消息的冯大辉前两天推送了一篇很有意思的文章，大概是探讨一个B站视频对微信存储机制可能存在的误解。文中提出了一个实验方法，看到做了试验可能会有奖品，我眼睛一下放光，不如就趁此机会做几个试验，好好探讨一下微信在iOS上的文件存储机制，包括：

转发文件是否会占用额外的存储空间？
从同一人处多次接收同一份文件是否会占用额外的空间？
从不同人处多次接收同一份文件是否会占用额外的空间？
微信和WeChat在以上这些问题上是否存在差异？
同一台手机上的不同微信账号接收的同一文件是否占用额外存储空间？

试验的环境是iOS 14.8.1、iPhone 11、微信8.0.28。首先我们删除手机上的微信重新安装。登录一个WeChat小号（小号A）。此时微信占用的空间是少的可怜的752.2MB，其中数据占244.5MB。我提前准备好了一个Ubuntu的iso镜像（880MB）。将它发送给这个小号。下载后重启手机，可以看到，微信占用的空间变成了1.77GB，其中数据占1.26GB。多出来大约1GB的空间，可能是除了文件以外的缓存、其他需要的程序和资源文件。
接收文件前后的微信
接下来我们正式开始实验。我们讲接收到的文件转发给三个不同的小号。重启手机，可以看到，如冯大辉所料，微信所占用的存储空间并没有增加。依然是1.77GB（数据1.26GB)。微信显然做了最基本的文件存储去重。
所占空间没有变化
接下来，我从另一个微信号将刚刚发送的文件再次转发给小号三遍。当我点进新发送的文件时，看到需要接受文件，我有一种不详的预感。难道微信真会重新接收一遍文件？所幸，当我点击接收文件后，文件在一瞬间就接收完成了。显然，微信也伴有服务器端的去重，在服务器上的同一份文件，在本地并不会接收多次。重启手机也可以看到，微信占用的空间并无增加。
看似要重新接收，实际所占空间没有明显变化
按照这个逻辑，即使是不同的人转发给我的同一份文件，应该也不会需要重复下载，或是占用额外的空间。我试着用另外两个小号（小号B、小号C）将同一份文件转发给小号A。虽然也显示需要接收文件，但同刚才一样，一瞬间就完成了接收。再次重启手机，微信所占用的空间依旧没有变化。
不过，刚才验证的情况中，虽然是多个账号转发给一个小号，但是微信很容易在服务器端追溯到，这些文件的源头是同一个。那假如各个账号是各自上传的同一份文件，微信在服务器端是否也有去重能力呢？为此，我在另一台小米手机上登录小号B与小号C，各自发送同一份文件给小号Ａ。发送文件的时间较长。这似乎足以让人判断出，微信大概没有类似百度网盘的文件去重判断。
然而出人意料的是，小号A还是一瞬间就完成了文件的接收。重启手机后也可以看到，微信所占用的空间并没有明显增加（总计1.83GB，数据1.32GB）。这说明至少在服务器端，微信确实能够判断出一份文件是否曾经上传过。而缺少类似网盘的秒传功能，可能是微信本身没有相关功能，也可能是Android端微信需要优化。
实际所占空间依然只有一份文件大小
出于好奇，我又尝试从小号B发送一份内容相同，只有文件名不同的文件，看看微信的查重是否基于文件名，或是基于文件本身。经过等待漫长的发送，如我所料，接收只在一瞬间就完成了。由此可知，微信的文件去重基于内容，并不依赖名字。
不同文件名也不会多占用空间
上面测试的都是同一账号下的情况。那么，同一台手机上的不同账号间又是怎样呢？我尝试在刚刚登录小号A的手机上切换了一个微信账号B。可以看到，这次转发收到的相同文件，需要重新接收下载。重启手机也能看到微信的占用空间变为3.8G（数据3.29G）。不过在这一微信账号下，同一文件仍然只需要下载保存一份，再次收到就能秒存。同时利用这个微信账号简单试了一下，我发现以上WeChat的文件存储机制对微信也同样成立。
实打实地需要下载，所占空间也倍增了
到这里，我们可以基本得出结论，iOS的微信文件存储去重做得还是比较令人满意的。同一账号下的同一个文件，只要内容相同，就只会在本地留存一份。未来微信团队可以努力的方向是不同账号间的文件存储去重。
另外值得一提的是，微信大概是真的有在代码层面实现去重，而非依赖APFS的CoW特性。因为即使只占一份空间，iPhone在统计容量时也会重复计算一个文件的多次拷贝。通过多次复制粘贴同一份文件，你能很容易地复现苹果的这个Bug：
苹果什么时候出4T iPhone？
在我原本的设想中，我写出这篇文章后，与其拿到那500元钱，我更想获得一个与Fenng交流的机会，说服他微信是一个糟糕的产品。但转念一下，即使我做到了，也并不能改变得了微信这个产品本身，以及我们必须使用它的环境。更何况再一看那篇文章，是要证明微信没有去重才能拿到那笔钱。是我审题不细了😀

如果你觉得我的这篇文章不错，也欢迎你阅读我之前有关微信的两篇文章：虎头蛇尾的《微信戒断实验》与尝试减少微信占用空间的《微微微信怎么办》。]]></summary>

If you own and use a smartphone capable of connecting to arbitrary computers all over the world, then you are a user of Radio Access Networks (RAN). A RAN is provided by your cellular provider, and it handles wireless connections between your smartphone and your communication provider.
While your smartphone may be running an open source operating system (Android) and the server you try to access is probably running Linux, there's a lot of proprietary technology in between to make the connection happen. While you may have a basic understanding of how networking works locally, this knowledge stops when you plug a SIM card into your smartphone in order to make a connection with a cell tower possible. In fact, the majorit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[智能家居。我的理解是：智能的、易用的，能给生活提供极大便利的，才能称之为「智能家居」。
大家好，我是少数派新晋 Martix 作者，目前从事主要以政府项目为主的运营。作为我在少数派潜水多年后的第一篇内容，就是如何利用极低的成本打造属于你的智能家居。
内容背景

本文将以「Home Assistant」智能家居平台（简称 「Home Assistant」，下同），开展工作，并通过 iOS 的 HomeKit 及 Android 自身的设备管理器来控制智能家居配件。关于「Home Assistant」的详细介绍，如何部署及安装插件的教学，少数派已有前辈进行了详细说明，这里不再赘述。

需强调的是，笔者通过 Debian 10 进行部署，版本是 2022.3.8，预装插件与其他方法略有出入。
由于系统过于老旧，「Home Assistant」的 Home Assistant Supervisor 不再支持 Debian 10 ，但使用下来，似乎实际上没有影响。
重复造轮子？

既然前辈已经在少数派中发表了基于「Home Assistant」构建的「智能家居」内容，为何笔者仍然要以此作为在少数派的第一篇内容？不是前辈撰写的内容不好，只是内容方向不同，本文将基于 YAML 语言来定制属于自己的「智能家居」。
本文将尽可能使用通俗的语言，力求做到即使每一位读者未曾接触也不能理解 YAML 语言的情况下能码出自己想要的配置文件，但由于笔者对 YAML 语法也未能做到了然于胸，更多地是一边学习一边进行，涉及到变量的部分无可奉告。
自身情况及案例
自身情况

笔者家中由于入网设备较多，以及需要多网合并带宽等需求，传统路由器性能已无法达到笔者需求，因此家中有一台低功耗服务器作为软路由使用，部署在 VMware 虚拟机中。

所使用网络基于中国电信，配备有公网非固定 IP 和动态域名。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日（2022/9/15）设计圈有个大新闻，Adobe 公布了收购 Figma 的消息：

Adobe 的官方公告
Figma 的官方公告
Figma CEO 的推特

Adobe 决定用 200 亿美元（一半股票，一半现金）收购 Figma，交易还需要获得监管部⻔的批准，预计将在 2023 年完成。
这对于设计界来说是一个爆炸性的新闻，虽然在此前也有征兆，早在去年（2021）Figma 的最早的两个联合创始人之一，与现任 Figma CEO 在大学时期一起创建 Figma 的前 CTO Evan Wallace 从 Figma 离职了，可能在那时就已经决定了 Figma 的命运。
对于这次收购，很多设计师对 Figma 非常的悲观，相比 Figma 而言 Adobe 更像是一个无情的资本机器，收购来的产品鲜有好下场的，上一个 Adobe 收购的界面设计工具 Macromedia Fireworks 已经死在 2013 年了。
Macromedia Fireworks 1.0
而 Adobe 的旧有产品缓慢又迟钝的更新，在设计师群体中形成了 Adobe 就是一头笨拙的大象的印象。在过去，设计师们既不满意又无法逃过 Adobe 的魔掌，Figma 的出现让设计师至少在 UI 设计领域上挣脱了 Adobe 的束缚，可惜即使 Figma 在 UI 设计领域战胜了 Adobe，又拓宽了设计与协作的领域，最终还是被 Adobe 花钱摆平了。
很多设计师对 Adobe 收购最有印象的是 2005 年收购 Macromedia，曾经风靡一时的 Macromedia 产品 Dreamweaver、Fireworks、Flash、 Authorware 几乎都死在了 Adobe 手上，其实 Adobe 的买买买从更早就开始了，Adobe 的代表产品 Photoshop 就是 1995 年收购…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spotify 可以说是少数派中无所不知的一款音乐软件，简洁克制的界面设计和无干扰的听歌体验吸引了不少听众。但是一直以来，Spotify 在 Android 上算不上有特别好的体验。尤其是一直没有修复的手势条沉浸问题，一条黑色的底边让人感到非常膈应。Spotify 似乎也没有做Light Mode 的打算，如果能有个亮色主题也会非常好看。
来源：@酱紫表
⚠️使用该 App 需要有 Spotify Premium
Introducing to New redesign Spotify: Jetispot

打开应用的第一个界面，我就已经被吸引到了。这些控件按钮都有十足的“原生”的味道
Welcome to Jetispot!
开始体验一下全新风格的 Spotify
登录后，可以看到主界面和Spotify的基本排布类似。Navigation Bar 上分为主页、搜索和资料库，右上角的三个小图标排布也相同。不过可以看到，作者还添加了两个分类标签：Music 和 Podcasts & Shows。我认为这是一个很实用的功能，毕竟谁也不想在公共场合打开后看到播客里显示一些很奇怪的东西 可惜这个App本身还未完成，这部分还不能正常使用。

随意探索一下
可以看到在搜索页面依然是大差不差。最明显的就是 Browse all 所有的卡片都用上了圆角。不过也能看到搜索栏功能还尚未实现。

现在，我们来选择一个专辑看看
可以看到在专辑页面中，背景色不再是原来的偏向于黑暗的页面。背景的渐变颜色是根据专辑封面来选取的，与 Spotify 相比感觉没有那么的压抑，整体显得很轻快明亮。

选择一首歌来听听
感觉加载速度和 Spotify 比起来没有很大的延迟，就是一个用起来不会因为加载不动而感到不舒适。不过这个音乐界面相对来说有一些简陋，上半部分很空旷。同时进度条也没有用上长得像蛇一样的波浪条👀

还可以做的更好

整体而言，我对 Android 上能有一个外观不错的 Spotify 第三方还是很满意了。
毕竟 Spotify 连个手势条沉浸都不管
Jetispot 可以说是很好看，但绝对算不上稳定优秀。
在我使用的过程中经常会偶尔遇到闪退和 Bug。而且这个软件很多功能尚未完成：搜索栏尚未支持，消息通知点无法使用，主页的筛选也无法使用，点赞的功能尚未实现，通知栏中的小图标也尚未适配。
小图标的位置只有空虚⚪
该 App 目前仍然在继续开发中。作者在 Telegram Channel 中还发布了正在制作歌词部分的预览。
以下是作者在 Github 上的规划

What's working:

sign in (login/pass only, no FB/Meta/whatsoever support, no Smart Lock either)
"browse", "home", album, premium plan, artist and genre screens (some of the blocks might be unsupported)
library: "liked songs" w/ tag&sort support, rootlist (liked playlists) + pins + artist/album support w/ nice animations, delta updates + pub/sub processing support
basic playback w/ Spotify Connect support (connect support is very WIP)
fairly optimized R8 rules, providing approx. 5-6 megabytes release APK size (with the playback and protobuf parts!)

What's in progress:

"Now Playing" improvements
better service (notification improvements)

希望可以能够长久的发展下去，RIP for Xpo Music🙏
你可以在 Github 或 Telegram Channel 免费下载使用 Jetispot。]]></summary>

Fri, 09/16/2022 - 03:00

            
This morning, after returning home from a mini vacation, I decided to run apt update and apt upgrade from the command line just to see whether there had been any updates while I was offline. After issuing the update command, something didn't seem quite right; I was seeing messages along the lines of:
W: https://updates.example.com/desktop/apt/dists/xenial/InRelease: Key is stored in legacy trusted.gpg keyring (/etc/apt/trusted.gpg), see the DEPRECATION section in apt-key(8) for details.
True, it's just a warning, but still there's that scary word, deprecation, which usually means it's going away soon. So I thought I should take a look. Based on what I found, I thought my experience would be wor…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你到了一个陌生的地方旅游，你会选择哪种方式？

方式一：去名胜古迹，或被证明过很好玩的地方打卡；
方式二：随机开车，走到哪儿就在哪儿玩。

我是属于比较保守的那类人，我会选择第一种，这样感觉更保险。但是我住在加拿大的姨娘选择的是第二种。下面这个是她的朋友圈：

随机点地图的出行方式让我心生艳羡，于是评论道「特别好」。
但我想很多人，包括我在内，都会觉得这种靠随机点地图就走的方式比较冒险，就像去到一家陌生的商场里，会先通过大众点评的评级进行一轮筛选，然后再去看对应店家下的评论，最后确定在了一家网红餐厅上。
这种由别人构建出的无形的价值系统，会让我们不自觉地去遵从，我把这种价值系统称作「体裁」。
拧巴、纠结、焦虑，都可能是因为你身处的体裁与你的内在目标产生了矛盾。我想通过这篇文章，疏通一下你的「自我拧巴」情绪。
一、体裁与规则
体裁原本指的是「一切艺术作品的种类和样式」。一个表现形式，只有在特定的场景中，才会发挥应该有的意义。
赵衡毅在《趣味符号学》里说1：

所有的符号文本，都从属于一定的体裁，体裁是一种符号发出者与接收者都接受的一个文化契约，在契约中，符号的发送者与接收者互相限制对方的自由，但是增加了效率。

比如，小说和说明书就是不同的体裁，两者都有对应的呈现形式。而对于读者而言，看小说可以不用当真，但是看说明书需要一板一眼地照着指示来改变现实。
在看一本书之前，先知道它属于什么体裁，就能提高你和作者的沟通效率。再比如谍战人员之间秘密传输的暗号，就需要严格按照对应的体裁规范，去生成信息和解析信息。
体裁如果延伸到我们的生活方式里，它就是某一个群体约定俗成的潜规则。这些规则会束缚着我们的思想和行为。群体有大有小，小到某一个兴趣社群，大到社会性别的约束。

One day in March of 2020, a few of my Opensource.com teammates and I grabbed lunch to talk about how we would work from home for the next couple of weeks until this pandemic got nipped in the bud. At the end of the work day, I packed up my laptop and walked out the door of our office building. Several months later, we were all still working from home. None of us had returned to our office-based workstations. In July 2020, using safety precautions, we were granted access to our workstation solely to retrieve personal items. My desk was left exactly as I left it that afternoon in March. Expiring snacks stashed in my secret drawer. Picture frames collecting dust. Comic strips pinned up.

DDEV is an open source tool that makes it simple to get local PHP development environments up and running within minutes. It’s powerful and flexible as a result of its per-project environment configurations, which can be extended, version controlled, and shared. In short, DDEV aims to allow development teams to use containers in their workflow without the complexities of bespoke configuration.
DDEV replaces more traditional AMP stack solutions (WAMP, MAMP, XAMPP, and so on) with a flexible, modern, container-based solution. Because it uses containers, DDEV allows each project to use any set of applications, versions of web servers, database servers, search index servers, and other types of sof…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part 0 引入
众所周知，Watch 有两种视图。第一个是「列表视图」，第二个则是「蜂窝视图」。我第一次用蜂窝视图的时候觉得这种交互模式非常炫酷，但是用了一段时间后的感受是 —— 「就像把杂货箱的东西全部倾倒出来，然后直到找着这一次需要的东西」。这无疑是一个非常糟糕的体验，因为每一次找 App 都要反复体验一下找杂物的难受感。所以这里触发了一个痛点是：「买完 Apple Watch 之后，我们应该如何快速找到并打开目标 app 呢？」
回忆一下小时候混乱的工具箱
本篇文章的前提 —— 在抛除了「Siri」、「程序坞」、「表盘上的快捷入口」三种检索方式的基础之上，再来探索有没有办法可以进一步提高效率，让我们的「应用菜单」也可以具备更强的检索性，做到井井有条。
Grid View（网格视图，我也喜欢称为蜂窝视图）
Part 1 思路总括
一开始我是换回了习惯的「列表视图」，依靠皇冠的转动来找到 App。但是列表视图有个问题是 —— 你无法调整 App 的显示顺序。就算你可以调整并分类 App，你也有可能需要在「单向」上线性地浏览众多的 App 之后才能找到目标，
List View（列表视图）
所以思路开始清晰起来 —— 如果我们把应用进行分类，并从中心延伸到几个不同的方向，就可以减少查找的时间和查找的路径长度。基于此，我们利用蜂窝的特性，从中心恰好可以切割出 6 条大方向，代表 6 个大类，然后把最主要的 App 直接放到 6 条线上。相当于至少提高检索速度 6 倍。
自制演示图
Part 2 和我一起来分类
现在，请大家停下 1 分钟，和我一起思考：我的 Apple Watch 上大致都有哪些 app 呢？对于我而言，我会分为以下 6 大类（逆时针），然后把最常用的放到线上：

健康
运动
音乐·声音
办公·社交·信息
支付
其他工具

近期，微信因推出输入法再次冲上热搜，由于越使用占用空间越大，又一次激起了人们对微信「小而美」的调侃。
为什么微信越来越臃肿了？在过去十一年来，微信是如何一步一步成为一个超级 APP 的？为了了解背后的发展故事，我作了此文加以梳理。研究中国最大的社交软件的发展史，其实也是研究过去十几年来简中移动互联网的变迁过程。也是试图解答一个徘徊许久的疑问：这些在摇滚精神和改革开放理念下成长的一代人，简中世界互联网的掌门人，作为新中国历史以来最成功的阶级上升案例，又是如何一步一步，从勇者变成恶龙的。
本文亦有视频版本。
老大哥在看着你
在 1984 的开篇有这么一句话：无论你走往哪个方向，总有一双眼睛跟着你。Big Brother is watching you.

如今，无论身处何时何地，只要打开手机，也有一双眼睛在看着你。
船票：新大陆与旧秩序
今年是世界末日后的第十年。在今天，很多人可能并不了解或已经遗忘了 2012 的含义。但在十年前，桌面互联网发展的高峰之时，新兴媒体里关于世界末日的讨论贯穿了 2012 年始末。2012 贴吧也是那一年里最热门的百度贴吧之一。有人发帖说自己变卖了全部家产，准备在末日到来前玩个痛快。
风靡一时的 2012 贴吧
待到末日论调随新年钟响而息鼓偃旗，人们发现生活还要继续；曾以为世界将有很大的变化，然而现实来临时却总是似是而非，但未来的确将有所不同。
2011 年，采用三明治架构的、被视作时代经典的 iPhone 4 进入中国市场；同年，iPhone 4S 在乔布斯逝世前一天发布，被喻为乔布斯的遗作，引起了热烈的抢购和黄牛加价。「割肾换爱疯」的梗也从那时流传开来。十月份，《乔布斯传》中文版上市，成为当年排行第一的畅销书，销量甚至力压了当时常年霸占销冠、各有新书的韩寒和郭敬明。在一篇《萌芽》杂志对韩寒的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[@yechezkel_rabinovich and the rest of our awesome team, we have created an APM that redefines cloud-native observability with the use of eBPF.

No engineer would question the importance of solid application monitoring in production. These tools help us sleep better at night, and solve that crazy sh*itstorm when it hits. And it always does.

Application monitoring solutions have taught us that we can have all the data we need to feel covered, all the time. Thing is, these solutions are so hard to integrate and they store so much data that they just can’t scale.

groundcover is here to disrupt the APM market and change the way these solutions work and operate.

Observability should be a tool to help companies scale and thrive. We make it effortless and scalable for developers, so they can focus on what really matters - building world-changing products.

With groundcover you can instantly get:
❇️ Logs from all across your cluster.
❇️ Metrics with mind-blowing granularity such as API latency, error rate, and throughput.
❇️ Traces from protocols like HTTP, gRPC, Redis, Kafka, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more.
❇️ A map of all service dependencies.
❇️ K8s infrastructure monitoring and tracking of K8s events.

Oh and we’re Prometheus-compatible, so if you’re working in Grafana we’re just a datasource away.

groundcover takes 1 minute to install on even the most heavy-duty K8s clusters.

Try out our free-tier at www.groundcover.com; One day you’ll look back, and say that you were there when APM changed, for good.

Seth Kenlon
Wed, 09/14/2022 - 03:00

            
The typical setup for Internet connectivity today is for your home to have a router, usually a little physical box located somewhere in your house, that acts as a gateway to the rest of the world. The router creates a local network, and you connect your devices to it, including your computer, mobile, TV, game console, and anything else that needs to connect to the Internet or to each other. It's deceptively easy to think of this setup as there being two "sides" of your router: On one side there's the Internet, and on the other, your devices. That's an awful colloquial, though, because in reality there's an entire worldwide network of computers on one side of your router, and your digital life on the othe…]]></summary>

Bobby Gryzynger
Wed, 09/14/2022 - 03:00

            
When using a complex Kubernetes operator, you often have to orchestrate Jobs to perform workload tasks. Examples of Job implementations typically provide trivial scripts written directly in the manifest. In any reasonably-complex application, however, determining how to handle more-than-trivial scripts can be challenging.
In the past, I've tackled this problem by including my scripts in an application image. This approach works well enough, but it does have a drawback. Anytime changes are required, I'm forced to rebuild the application image to include the revisions. This is a lot of time wasted, especially when my application image takes a significant amount of time to build. This also mean…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一转眼就到了九月，全新的少数派会员服务也运转了两个多月，经过会员组、编辑部、产品组、数字工具组的共同努力，目前的产品、内容和服务，都已经进入了稳定状态，接下来该周边组发力了，给大家准备这一季的实体周边，借着周边的设计，我也重新总结一下少数派会员的权益和价值。

在我们的会员介绍页面，有三个简单的图形，这背后是产品负责人的设计思考，它代表着一个三角形切割打磨成圆形的过程，其实也完美的诠释了少数派业务与会员服务的关系，以及我们未来的愿景。这套图形也正是会员周边的核心元素，我想把背后的故事讲给大家听听。
超值的六边会员服务
代表着我给会员定制的六个方面的服务，它们分别是专属内容、专属产品、高质社群、定制周边、商品福利、共创增值，逐个给大家讲讲。

专属内容
最近几年，短视频爆发，娱乐内容泛滥，大量的攫取着我们的时间。但我们始终认为，如果想让工作和生活变得更好，单靠娱乐远远是不够的，我们需要持续的学习和成长，持续的创新和创造，而深度图文+语音对谈，依然是承载这类内容的最佳方式。而这些经验和思考类内容，稀缺性强，生产成本也高，且很难获得广告支持，会员服务将支撑我们长期深耕这些内容，不断扩展领域，让会员用户跟我们共同成长。

比如一份针对用户消费领域的深度报告内容，制作周期可能长达数月，目前已经针对机械键盘、显示器、咖啡、录音设备等领域推出了这类消费报告。帮助大家全面完整的了解这些产品和用法。
专属产品
我们几乎开发了一套完整的会员产品模块，从页面设计、产品功能、用户体系，都在围绕会员进行规划和重构，我们不像以往的互联网公司那样，为了流量去做大而全，而是希望不断提供独特的创新的产品使用体验。

会员用户可以给我们最直接和有效的反馈，更有很多产品从业者，甚至能跟我们一起共创有趣的新模块。除了内容、商品，我们甚至希望联动线下服务。
高质社群
家家都可以做社群，做好社群却很难，少数派本身就是…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-09-13T08:58:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《白描》是一款简单好用的 OCR 文字识别与扫描工具，主要功能有提取图片中的文字、图片表格转 Excel、公式识别、文件扫描、身份证扫描、合成 PDF 等。现在，《白描》除了可以在手机上和网页上用，Windows 版本也正式发布，支持 Windows 7 / 8 / 10 / 11，目前《白描》已经包含 iOS、Android、Windows、macOS、网页、小程序多种版本，想在哪用就在哪用。除小程序外，所有平台的会员通用，也就是说，在手机端买个会员，就可以一个账号全平台使用了。

截屏 OCR 识别
首先，《白描》 Windows 版本最方便的就是截屏识别，App 运行后，会在右下角托盘有个小图标，右键小图标可以有更多操作，比如：截屏识别。

除了通过托盘图标菜单识别，可以在《白描》设置界面设置截屏的快捷键，识别更高效。

截图后会弹出识别结果页面，左侧是截图后的原图，右侧是文本结果，在识别结果页面可以复制结果，导出 Word 或 TXT 文本。
截图不只是文字识别，还支持公式识别、表格识别。

如果是表格识别，在识别结果的部分可以直接导出 Excel，公式识别可以直接复制为 LaTeX 格式。

如果你平常截图识别的种类非常多，比如可能需要识别文字、表格、公式、二维码等，可以在设置里打开自动检测图片类型，软件会根据检测到的类型自动进行相应的识别。
文字识别
除了截屏快捷识别，也可以在主界面中进行操作，在左侧选中图片文字提取，便可以进行普通的 OCR 文字识别，支持单张识别、批量识别，长图也同样支持直接识别。

主界面的文字识别，除了图片格式，也支持直接将 PDF 文件拖入识别，首先软件会将 PDF 的所有页面解析为图片，然后进行识别。

表格识别
主界面左侧切换为表格识别，可以直接将图片中的表格转换为 Excel 格式，无论带线还是不带线的表格都支持。

如果有多个表格，也支持把表格识别为多个工作表（Sheet）。
公式识别
主界面左侧切换为公式识别，可以将图片中的公式转换为文本，复制为 LaTeX 格式。

关于会员
《白描》手机 App 中购买的会员可以直接在 Windows 版本中使用，在设置页面登录账号就可以了。

关于 macOS 版
《白描》之前已经在 Mac App Store 中发布了 macOS 版本，此次又发布了一个新支持独立下载安装的版本，基本功能和上面介绍的 Windows 版本一样，同样支持截屏识别、文字识别、表格识别、公式识别、PDF 识别，不过它还有另一个功能：让你的 Mac 变成一个 OCR 识别服务器：

如果你会一些编程，又拥有一台 Mac 电脑，想自己实现一个 OCR 工具，那可以使用《白描》提供的服务器服务，发挥你的想象力，做出任何自己喜欢的 OCR 识别工具。这部分如果感兴趣的人多，我会考虑单独写一篇文章来介绍服务器模式。
送码
你可以在少数派软件商城下载《白描》试用，或者直接购买包含专属免费教程内容的《白描工具升值包》。
在评论区说说你对 OCR 文字识别工具的需求和使用场景，以及对于《白描》的想法和建议，9 月 23 日选出 2 位读者送出《白描工具升值包》黄金版会员。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[继 7 月的《PasteNow 2.3 发布：支持 Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴》后，PasteNow 2.4 又带来了一个非常实用的功能，即「将最近一个项目粘贴为纯文本 」。
新特性：将最近一个项目粘贴为纯文本
在 PasteNow 的使用场景当中，复制粘贴文本是其中最常见的一个场景，而其中又有一部分的需求是将富文本以纯文本的形式粘贴出来，或者换句话说就是：去除文本的格式。
PasteNow 一直都有按需去除格式的功能，它可以按纯文本粘贴或原始格式（富文本）进行粘贴。不过这个过程会需要将 PasteNow 的界面唤起，并按下内置的快捷键来达到这个目标。如果需要多次处理较多的文本，处理起来就会相对比较慢了。
于是在 2.4 版本中，针对这一场景，PasteNow 引入了一个新的快捷键，即「将最近一个项目粘贴为纯文本 」。通过设置成自己习惯的快捷键，然后就可以非常迅速地以统一的形式在任何 App 里完成文本的去格式粘贴，这个过程甚至不需要将 PasteNow 的界面呼出来！
举个例子，比如要将一个网页富文本以纯文本形式粘贴至 Word，首先将「Option+Command+V」设置为快捷键后，接下去只需要这样操作：

在 Safari 里按下 Command + C 复制一段网页文本；
来到 Word，直接按下 Option+Command+V，那么这段网页文本就会以纯文本的形式粘贴至 Word 里面。

请看视频演示：
 
 
相信通过新增这个快捷键，PasteNow 可以又快又好地完成纯文本粘贴这一场景的需求。
macOS 版本及 iOS 版本的其他更新
和以往版本一样，每个版本也会带来旧有功能的完善和修复，其他更新有：

调整音效的音量大小，使与系统当前音量匹配；
修复无法复制正在编辑的标题的问题；
修复无法显示其他应用保存的 JPEG 格式图像的问题；
修复 macOS 端修改列表名称后，没有同步至 iOS 端的问题；
修复暗色模式下，在一些白色背景的剪贴板文本下无法显示标题和快捷键标识的问题。

其中 iOS 版本最主要的变化是完善了对 iOS 16 的适配：

修复了在 iOS 16 Beta 版本中，底部工具栏会布局错乱的问题；
修复无法通过搜索标题找到对应项目的问题。

小结
目前 PasteNow 还有很多需求和功能有待去实现，我会继续保持节奏，将其不断完善下去。
