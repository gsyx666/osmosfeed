The moment has come to get your hands dirty: let's write your first Rust program. As for all the code examples in this course, you can find the complete code in the accompanying Git repository: https://github.com/skerkour/black-hat-rust
$ cargo new sha1_cracker

Will create a new project in the folder sha1_cracker.
Note that by default, cargo will create a binary (application) project. You can create a library project with the --lib flag: cargo new my_lib --lib.

SHA-1 is a hash function used by a lot of old websites to store the passwords of the users. In theory, a hashed password can't be recovered from its hash. Thus by storing the hash in their database, a website can assert that a given user has the k…]]></summary>

Following Google’s acquisition of Fitbit and its rebranding of the health tech company as ‘Fitbit by Google,’ the search giant is moving to tightly integrate its services with Fitbit’s own. A Google account will be required for “some uses” of Fitbit devices and features from 2023, with plans to have all existing Fitbit accounts migrated to Google accounts by 2025. 
An updated support page says that creating a new Fitbit account and activating new Fitbit devices and features will require a Google account from 2023. Existing Fitbit account holders will be able to move over to a Google account or remain with their existing Fitbit login until “at least early 2025,” at which point support for Fitbit accounts will be terminated.

When NASA smashes a spacecraft into an asteroid on Monday, people on Earth will get an extremely close look at the action. 
NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirect Test (DART) is headed for its final destination, the surface of an asteroid called Dimorphos, which it will crash into at speeds of over 14,000 miles per hour. Researchers are hoping that the collision will change the asteroid’s orbit, speeding it up just a tiny bit. 
Neither Dimorphos, nor its larger companion, Didymos, pose any danger to Earth, but the experiment is designed to test whether or not a similar impact could make a difference if scientists ever discovered an asteroid that posed an imminent threat to life on Earth. 
DART will be on its own during its final approach. The...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌老板对员工说，不要把乐趣和金钱等同起来

谷歌员工在一次内部会议上问，为什么这家巨型公司在去年创纪录的利润之后，通过削减旅行预算和福利来“压榨员工”。谷歌 CEO 皮查伊回应称，“我记得谷歌很小的时候，也很潦倒。……我们不应该总是将乐趣等同于金钱。我认为，在一家努力工作的创业公司，人们可能正在享受乐趣……”。员工们还询问了高管薪酬问题，据说皮查伊没有回答。他的身价估计超过 10 亿美元，去年获得了 630 万美元的报酬。


消息来源：CNBC



老王点评：虽然说确实如此，但是亿万富翁的这种回答总是让人觉得不太满意。




Mozilla 重申会继续支持 WebRequst API

目前的 Chromium 扩展大多使用 MV2，谷歌将从明年开始采用新的扩展规范 MV3，限制现在使用的 MV2 的 WebRequest API 的功能。采用旧的 API 的扩展将从明年 1 月开始不被列出，之后，将被禁用。uBlock Origin 等广告屏蔽扩展使用 WebRequest API 在广告下载前屏蔽其请求，在禁用该 API 后，用户体验将受到影响，比如出现闪烁。Mozilla 上周重申，它将支持 MV3，但同时也会继续支持 V2 的 WebRequst API。


消息来源：ghacks



老王点评：这就是浏览器垄断的行为，无论你愿意不愿意。这次我觉得 Mozilla 做的挺好，至少给用户以选择权。




几乎一半的工业机器人都在中国

根据国际机器人联合会（IFR）的一份新报告，中国现在几乎拥有世界上所有机器人装置的一半，而且它的领先优势正在迅速增加。2021 年的安装量达到了 243,300 台的新纪录，与前一年相比，增长了 44%。中国从 10 年前每万名员工拥有 10 个工业机器人，到 2020 年每万名员工拥有 246 个，在世界排名中名列第九。


消息来源：IFR



老王点评：虽然至少人均排名第九，但是这么大的总量，依然非常可观。]]></summary>

It can be used to route traffic to one or many servers and can be chained so that the same url can lead to different locations at different points in time. This is what enables blue-green deployment of software and releasing new versions of software without downtime.

So how can we use DNS to blue-green our software? In this article we will go through the process step by step.
First we need to understand what blue-green means. Blue-green deployment is the process of provisioning more than one production environment so that you can set up a new version before cutting over to it.

By having both environments running you can quickly switch over to the new version which minimizes downtime and allows you to switch …]]></summary>

API Gateway Access logs are a feature of API Gateway that allows you to log all requests made to your API. This is a great feature to have enabled for debugging purposes. You can also use this data to create metrics and dashboards to monitor your API. You can read more about API Gateway Access Logs here.
Access logs are useful for two main reasons:
Debugging: If you get a spike in 500 Internal Server Error responses, you can locate an access log to point you in the right direction to start your investigation.

Gaurav Kamathe

Open source software (OSS), once a niche segment of the development landscape, is now ubiquitous. This growth is fantastic for the open source community. However, as the usage of OSS increases, so do concerns about security. Especially in mission-critical applications— think medical devices, automobiles, space flight, and nuclear facilities—securing open source technology is of the utmost priority. No individual entity, whether developers, organizations, or governments, can single-handedly solve this problem. The best outcome is possible when all of them come together to collaborate.
The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) formed to facilitate this collaboration. Ope…]]></summary>

Richard Chambers
Mon, 09/26/2022 - 03:00

            
In this interview, I met up with Laurent Cozic, creator of the note-taking app, Joplin. Joplin was a winner of the 20i rewards, so I wanted to find out what makes it such a success, and how he achieved it.
Could you summarize what Joplin does?
Joplin is an open source note-taking app. It allows you to capture your thoughts and securely access them from any device.
Obviously, there are other note-taking apps out there—but apart from it being free to use, what makes it different?
The fact that it is open source is an important aspect for many of our users, because it means there is no vendor locking on the data, and that data can be easily exported and accessed in various ways.

I learned to work in a dockerized environment and use Nginx, Gunicorn ... inside Docker to make my application production ready.
Registration using either phone number or email

Basic E-commerce features.
Payment integration using Stripe.
Caching using a Redis backend.
Sending emails asynchronously using Celery and Redis as a message broker.
Custom permissions set for necessary endpoints.
Documentation using DRF Spectacular
Dockerized for local development and production
Django Rest Framework
PostgreSQL
Celery
Redis
Nginx
Docker
Stripe
This project makes use of:
Viewsets
Custom permissions
Nested serializers and so on. If you would like to strengthen your skills, I highly recommend you to check it out



I used Docker for local development and it has been so great! And then, with some adjustments, the application is production ready.
Tip: you can export your database schema to a SQL file using the command below:
docker exec -i [container_id] pg_dump -U [postgres_user]  --schema-only [database_name] > [target_path]

And then use this tool https://dbdiagram.io/ to generate ER diagram while playing around with the SQL code.

custom service.
Let's look at how we can combine the two for maximum flexibility.
Note: If you haven't read the above-linked articles, please read those first.
The process here will be very similar to injecting services, but how we do it is slightly different.
Open up your subscriber file and start by declaring the service you want to inject.
class ProductNotifierSubscriber {
    translateService;

    constructor({ translateService, eventBusService }) {
        this.translateService = translateService;
        eventBusService.subscribe("product.created", this.handleProduct);
    }
}

As you can see, we declare the translateService our custom service. Then inside the constructor, we assign it to the variable, gaining access to it in this file.
To use it, we can do the following:
handleProduct = async (data) => {
    this.translateService.translateProduct(data.id).then((title) => {
        console.log("New product title: " + title)
    })
};

And that's precisely how we can attach our custom service to fire off inside the subscriber.

There is no limit to how many services you can inject, but be aware they might bloat your subscribers.

The rumors were true: Amazon’s holding a second Prime-exclusive sales event starting on Tuesday, October 11th at 3AM ET / 12AM PT and running through Wednesday, October 12th. We first heard about the possibility of another day of deals back in June, but now Amazon has made it official — the only difference is that it’s calling the event Prime Early Access Sale instead of Prime Day.
Besides the name, it doesn’t look like too much is changing between the two events. Just like Amazon Prime Day, the Prime Early Access Sale should still bring some of the best deals of the year out to play, as well as feature sales on Amazon devices in addition to a wealth of other cool tech. So, if you’ve waited this long to buy a new pair of noise-canceling...

如果你是新 Linux 用户，想在不删除 OEM 安装的 Windows 的情况下安装 Linux Mint，请遵循本指南。完成下面描述的步骤后，你应该拥有一个双引导系统，你可以在其中学习和在 Linux 系统中完成工作，而无需引导 Windows。

1、开始之前你需要什么？

启动到你的 Windows 系统并从官方网站下载 Linux Mint ISO 文件。 ISO 文件是 Linux Mint 的安装镜像，我们将在本指南中使用它。

在官网（图1），下载 Cinnamon 桌面版的 ISO（适合所有人）。


下载链接




下载后，将 U 盘插入你的系统。然后使用 Rufus 或 Etcher 将上面下载的 .ISO 文件写入该 USB 驱动器。

2、准备一个分区来安装 Linux Mint

正常情况下，Windows 笔记本电脑通常配备 C 盘和 D 盘。C 盘是安装 Windows 的地方。对于新的笔记本电脑，D 驱动器通常是空的（任何后续驱动器，如 E 等）。现在，你有两个选项可供选择：一是 缩小 C 盘 为额外的 Linux 安装腾出空间。第二个是使用其他驱动器/分区，例如 D 盘或 E盘。

选择你希望的方法。

如果你选择使用 D 盘或 E 盘用于 Linux 系统，请确保先禁用 BitLocker，然后再禁用现代 OEM 安装的 Windows 笔记本电脑附带的所有其他功能。


从开始菜单打开 Windows PowerShell 并键入以下命令（图 2）以禁用 BitLocker。根据你的目标驱动程序更改驱动器号（这里，我使用了驱动器 E）。

美国立法者周四提出了一项要求，美国网络安全和基础设施安全局（CISA）需创建风险框架以提高开源软件安全性的措施。为了降低依赖开源代码的系统风险，各机构将利用该框架，CISA 将决定关键基础设施所有者和运营商是否也可以自愿使用它。

大多数系统依赖于免费提供的并由社区维护的开源软件来构建网站和应用程序；最大的用户之一是美国联邦政府。该立法由美国国土安全委员会主席兼高级成员、俄亥俄州共和党参议员 Sens. Rob Portman、R-Ohio 和 Gary Peters D-Mich 在一次听证会后提出，以回应在开源代码中发现的影响美国联邦系统和全球数百万其他系统的严重、广泛的 Log4j 漏洞。

“这一事件对联邦系统和关键基础设施公司——包括银行、医院和公用事业公司——构成了严重威胁，美国人每天都依赖这些公司提供基本服务，”彼得斯在公告中说。“这项明智的两党立法将有助于保护开源软件，并进一步加强我们的网络安全防御，防止网络犯罪分子和外国对手对全国网络发起的不断的攻击。”

这项《保护开源软件法》还要求美国管理和预算办公室为各机构发布关于保护开源软件的指南，在 CISA 网络安全咨询委员会中设立一个软件安全小组委员会，并要求 CISA 聘请开源软件专家协助处理网络事件。

在此之前，Peters 和 Portman 的提议已获得美国参议院一致通过并签署成为法律，以加强州和地方政府的网络防御，并迫使关键基础设施的所有者和运营商向 CISA 报告重大网络攻击和勒索软件付款。

Microsoft Surface tablets have been taking a beating at football events these past two weekends. During the Buffalo Bills game against the Miami Dolphins this afternoon, Bills offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey took his frustration out on his tablet as the Dolphins secured a win during the final moments of the game.
Dorsey’s reaction may have been warranted, although he probably could’ve chosen another outlet for his anger (like a stress ball perhaps?). The Bills had a chance to run one more play to win the game, but the team ultimately ran out of time, losing to the Dolphins 19-21. When cameras turned to the booth where he was watching the game, Dorsey ripped off his headset and tossed his hat before he picked up the tablet and started...

Dimorphos is a lump of space rock so far away from Earth that we don’t even know what it looks like — and on Monday, we’re going to smash it with a spacecraft. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) will be traveling at more than 14,000 miles per hour when it hits the asteroid, in what has to be one of the most metal science experiments of all time. 
DART is a NASA effort to see if it can change an asteroid’s movement in space. It’s being billed as the world’s first “planetary defense test mission” —  a test run to see if we have what it takes to avert a serious asteroid impact on Earth sometime in the future. You know, just in case. 
To be extremely clear, neither Dimorphos, or its larger companion Didymos, pose any threat to...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[对 GNOME 43 桌面环境的各种功能的介绍，以及它给你的日常需求和工作流程带来的变化和影响。




这篇文章总结了所有关于 GNOME 43 的必要信息，包括功能、发布时间表等等。GNOME 43 版本可能是自 GNOME 40 以来在功能和对你的工作流程影响最大的一个版本。

主要的变化包括更新的 Shell 和更快的性能，内含了 GTK4 和 libadwaita 的转换，翻新的文件应用和 Web 应用的奇妙变化。

所有这些必要的变化都是早该进行的，并将改变你在 GNOME 桌面上的传统工作流程，使你的工作效率更高。

时间表

GNOME 43 于 2022 年 9 月 21 日 正式发布。


GNOME 43 测试版：2022 年 8 月 31 日

GNOME 43 候选版：2022 年 9 月 4 日

GNOME 43 最终版：2022 年 9 月 21 日


GNOME 43 的功能

1、核心 Shell 的变化


终于，得益于 Wayland 最近的工作，GNOME 有了对高分辨率的滚轮支持。所以，如果你有一个高分辨率的显示器，用一个高级的鼠标（比如罗技 MX Master 3）来滚动应该成为了一种享受。

除了上述情况，GNOME 43 中的直接扫描输出direct scanout 支持将有助于多显示器环境。

服务器端的窗口装饰得到了基本的颜色支持。

Shell 还实现了一个功能，当焦点改变时，通知会消失，并不等待超时。

和每个版本一样，你在整个桌面上会体验到更好的动画性能，改进了网格和概览导航以及关键的更新，这给你带来了顺滑的体验。


这些就是核心变化的关键总结。现在，让我们来谈谈快速设置。

2、新的快速设置菜单

系统托盘中的快速设置完全改变了。快速设置项目和菜单现在采用药丸状…]]></summary>

When building my previous SaaS product, we realised how important customer churn is. It doesn’t matter how well you can acquire new customers - when churn is high your growth will stale and your margins will be low. And the worst part of it - you’ll know about it when it’s too late. We all know when customer quits, most of the times it’s already too late to fix things 🤷‍♂️. 

This template will help you with predicting customer churn by mapping the individual account health to the rules and formulas so you’ll immediately see what you need to do _before_ customer quit.

For the 1st version we’ve interviewed over 80 customer success professionals from companies like Google, Amazon, Mambu, Dynamic Yield, and many others. Then we did a small number of rev…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI 生成的漫画获得版权注册

Midjourney 是一个商业的图片合成服务。一位艺术家使用 Midjourney 创造了一本名为《黎明的扎丽亚》的漫画书，已经获得了美国版权注册。该作品是 AI 辅助的，而不是完全由 AI 创造的。艺术家编写了漫画故事，创造了版面，并做出了艺术选择，将图像拼接在一起。这本漫画书可以免费下载。


消息来源：ARS Technica



老王点评：即便 AI 还不能独立完成创作，也不能以 AI 身份取得版权和专利，但是 AI 辅助创作必然会越来越用在各种艺术创作中，而且可能会毫不逊色。很可能，以后你创作时，只是提供一些素材、提示词，然后去喝杯咖啡，等着从 AI 生成的结果中挑选一二。




黑客利用 BGP 劫持 IP 段窃取了约 23 万美元加密货币

8 月 17 日，英国一家不知名的网络运营商 Quickhost.uk 突然通过 BGP 广播宣布，隶属于亚马逊 AS16509 的一个 IP 段需要路由经过它的网络 AS20943。该 IP 段中的一个地址被用于托管加密货币交易所 Celer Bridge 的一个子域名。并且，攻击者还从某不知名的 CA 获得了一个 TLS 证书，然后托管了伪造的子域名网站，随后从访问该域名的 32 个账号中窃取了约 23 万美元的加密货币。这一 BGP 劫持持续了 3 个多小时后，亚马逊恢复了对该地址段的控制。


消息来源：ARS Technica



老王点评：无论是错误配置还是恶意欺诈，BGP 的脆弱性显露无疑。虽然也有一些补救措施，但是并没有根本上解决 BGP 安全问题，这是一个全行业的问题。




GNOME 43 发布

前两天，GNOME 43 发布了正式版本。它引入了一个重新设计的快速系统设置区域，一个新的 “设备安全” 管理区域，GNOME 文件管理器的各种改进，增强了 Mutter 合成器以更好地支持 Wayland，更多的应用程序已经从 GTK3 移植到 GTK4，以及整个桌面栈的许多其他变化。


消息来源：GNOME



老王点评：GNOME 和 KDE 作为 Linux 上最主要的两大桌面环境，虽然给人的感觉不是惊艳，但是却稳健的不断在改进。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“
              The age of man has ended, and the age of the machines has begun. 

The year is 2022.   Machines are creating art with words from humans at mind-boggling speed, volume and increasing quality. “Someone needs to stop this madness!”, “Art is dead”, “The artist-killer is here”, the world is holding it's breath. Will machines take over?

At the intersection of technology, art, and controversy - me and my co-founder Eric are launching Dreamsands, a platform to explore and buy licensing for AI generated visuals, images and content. As of today, we're inviting all creators and enthusiasts to submit their work on Dreamsands. Over 1 million visuals have already been submitted during our beta from the most cutting edge artists in AI creation.

It is estimated that more than 15.000 million AI images are created every day, with varying quality and purpose - and so far there hasn’t been any attempts to aggregate, curate and present this new image revolution online. As avid art lovers we found it increasingly hard to keep track of all the new imaging tools, forums and subreddits where people were posting amazing work, and thus the idea for Dreamsands was born.  

With Dreamsands we let anyone, anywhere in the world enjoy and explore the beauty and weirdness of AI generated visuals. 

Here’s a highlight of some of Dreamsands’ initial features:

◦      Explore over 1M+ images 
◦      Follow your favourite artists
◦      Like / Save / Favorite posts
◦	Save, and buy the art you like
◦      Buy royalty-free licenses
◦	Suggested posts

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redox OS 刚刚获得了大量匿名捐款。它将用于什么？令人兴奋的事情！




Redox OS 是一个用 Rust 编写的类 Unix 操作系统。

该项目由 Jeremy Soller 于 2015 年发起，他被公认为 System76 的首席工程师及Pop!_OS 的维护者。

我们还介绍了它今年早些时候的最后一个版本：基于 Rust 的 Redox OS 0.7.0 推出增强硬件支持。

虽然这些更新包括的改进可以让它在更多硬件上启动，但它可能不是大多数用户的日常驱动程序的替代品。

然而，这是一个令人兴奋的项目，值得关注。

而在收到匿名捐款后，事情变得更加精彩。

🤯 刚刚有人向 Redox OS 的捐赠地址发送了 299 个以太坊，相当于近 39 万美元（加密货币市场涨跌不定）。

嗯，那是一大笔钱！

根据 Jeremy 的最新推文，他还没有立即决定如何处理它。


一位匿名捐赠者刚刚向 @redox_os 捐赠地址发送了 299 以太（相当于 393,000 美元） 。这个地址和交易都是公开的。我不知道如何处理这种规模的捐赠，但在进行一些研究后很快就会有更多细节。https://t.co/f3yBDghWSh


但是，对推文的回复给了我们一些很好的建议。

一些人建议将其捐赠给负责 Rust 语言的人，还有一些人建议用这笔钱来赞助学习 Rust 和 OS 开发。

他肯定可以使用它来扩展 Redox OS 或其他任何需要该资源的东西。

归根结底，对于想要更多基于 Rust 的东西的人来说，无论 Jeremy 选择做什么，这都可能间接成为一件好事。

或者，也许买一辆带有 Redox OS 标志的布加迪？好吧，一些推特用户对这一事件有过搞笑的回复！😂


这不是开源项目第一次收到大量的加密货币捐赠。Apache 软件基金会在 2018 年收到了价值 100 万美元的比特币。


当 Jeremy 决定分享有关捐赠的更多细节以及他打算如何处理时，我将更新这篇文章。

💬 你如何看待匿名捐赠给 Redox OS？如果你得到那笔捐款，你会怎么做？在下面的评论框中让我们知道你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软的 WSL 现已支持 systemd，为用户提供了更好的体验。你可阅读此文了解更多。




WSL（Windows 的 Linux 子系统Windows Subsystem for Linux）终于拥有了对 systemd 的支持，这是在 systemd 的创建者加入微软的几个月后实现的。


更多 Linux 开发者们加入微软，systemd 的创建者也加入这一行列


而这已通过微软和 Cannonical 的合作成为可能。


如果你好奇 systemd 是什么：

systemd 是一套 Linux 系统的基本组成模块。它提供了一个系统和服务管理器，作为 PID 1 运行，并启动系统的其他部分。

来自：systemd.io


它作为一个初始化系统，启动并维持用户空间其他服务的正常运行。

让我们看看它是如何被引入 WSL 的。

systemd 增强 WSL 的体验




在 WSL 中引入 systemd，主要是为改善 Windows 机器上的 Linux 工作流程。

像 Debian、Ubuntu、Fedora 等，都是默认运行 systemd 的。因此，这项整合将使这些发行版的用户更方便地在 WSL 上做更多工作。

很多关键的 Linux 程序也是靠 systemd 实现的。例如 snap、microk8s 和 LXD 都依赖它。

即使我们有 不含 systemd 的发行版 可用，它们也并不适合所有人。因此，在 WSL 上添加对 systemd 的支持是很有意义的。

systemd 的存在也使得在 Windows 中使用更多工具来测试和运行成为可能，从而带来更好的 WSL 体验。

它是如何实现的

WSL 背后的团队必须修改其架构，它们让 WSL 的初始化进程在 Linux 发行版中以 systemd 的一个子进程启动。

正如其 官方公告 所述，这样做使得 WSL 初始化程序能够为 Windows 和 Linux 子系统之间的通讯提供必要的基础。

它们还做了额外的修改，通过防止 systemd 保持 WSL 实例的活动以确保系统的干净关机。

你亦可访问他们的 官方文档 以了解更多。

在 WSL 上使用 systemd


现有的 WSL 用户必须在他们的系统上手动启用 systemd，以防止由于 systemd 的引入而导致的启动问题。


首先，你必须确保你的系统运行的是 0.67.6 或更高版本的 WSL。

你可以通过以下命令检查你的 WSL 版本。

wsl --version


如果你正在运行旧版本，你可以通过 微软应用商店Microsoft Store 或者以下命令更新它。

wsl --update


此外，如果你不是 Windows 预览体验成员Windows Insider，你可以到 WSL 发行页面 下载它来体验。

为了让 systemd 在你的系统上运行，你需要修改 wsl.conf 这个文件以确保 systemd 在启动时运行。

在 wsl.conf 添加以下几行以使 WSL 在启动时运行 systemd

[boot]
systemd=true


最后，重启你的 WSL 实例以见证更改。

随着对 systemd 的支持，微软在 WSL 的发展又前进了一大步，这将使得 WSL 吸引更多用户。

💬 是否对 WSL 支持 systemd 感到兴奋？或是你更喜欢无 systemd 的发行版？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本快速指南介绍了在 Arch Linux 和其他发行版中使用终端设置和连接 WiFi 所需的步骤。


本指南非常适合没有 GUI 只有终端且没有其他有线互联网连接可用的情况。这些步骤可帮助你手动检测无线网卡和设备，并通过终端密码验证连接到 WiFi 热点。

本指南使用 iwd（Net Wireless Daemon）通过终端连接到 WiFi。

在 Arch Linux 和其他发行版中使用终端连接到 WiFi

1、设置 iwd

iwd 包有三个主要模块：


iwctl：无线客户端

iwd：守护进程

iwmon：监控工具


在终端中输入：

iwctl




如果找不到该命令，那么需要从 此处 下载安装包。

从任何其他具有互联网连接的系统/笔记本电脑获取帮助，以通过安装 USB 下载和安装软件包。

或者，如果你有一个可连接互联网的 USB 网卡，那么将其插入你的系统。并通过以下命令安装。

USB 网卡应该可以在 Arch 和当今大多数 Linux 系统中开箱即用，连接到互联网。

Arch：

pacman -S iwd


Debian、Ubuntu 和其他类似发行版：

sudo apt-get install iwd


Fedora：

sudo dnf install iwd


如果你看到了 iwctl 提示符（如下所示），那么继续下一步。

2、配置

运行以下命令以获取系统的无线设备名称。

device list




要获取 WiFi 网络列表，请运行以下命令。在以下命令和所有其他命令中将 wlan0 替换为你的设备名称。

station wlan0 get-networks




该命令为你提供具有安全类型和信号强度的可用 WiFi 网络列表。

3、连接

要连接到 WiFi 网络，请使用上述 get-networks 命令中的 WiFi 接入点名称运行以下命令。

station wlan0 connect


出现提示时输入你的 WiFi 密码。



如果一切顺利，你现在可以连接到互联网。

使用指南

如下所示，你可以使用简单的 ping 命令检查连接。ping 回复成功的数据包传输表示连接稳定。

ping -c 3 google.com


你还可以使用以下命令检查连接状态。

station wlan0 show


iwd 在 /var/lib/iwd 中保存 .psk 后缀的配置文件，其中带有你的接入点名称。此文件包含使用你的 WiFi 网络的密码和 SSID 生成的哈希文件。

按 CTRL+D 退出 iwctl 提示符。

总结

我希望本指南可以帮助你通过终端连接到互联网。当你没有其他方式连接到 WiFi 时，这会有所帮助。例如，如果你在独立系统（不是 VM）中安装 Arch Linux，那么需要连接到互联网以通过终端使用 pacman 下载软件包。

如果你遇到任何问题，请在下面的评论栏中指出错误消息。

黄仁勋说，“以同样的成本提供两倍的性能，或者以同样的性能一半的成本，每一年半翻番的摩尔定律，已经结束，它已经完全结束了。”他认为，“计算不是一个芯片问题，而是一个软件和芯片问题”，因而，英伟达为其芯片开发了强大的软件生态系统，这让一些分析师开始将英伟达视为一家迅速崛起的软件公司。


消息来源：Market Watch



老王点评：虽然摩尔定律已经被宣布死亡几次了，但是从现在的半导体技术发展来看，这次可能真的是死了。




CFTC 对去中心化自治组织提起诉讼

美国商品期货交易委员会（CFTC）周四晚些时候公布了对 bZx 协议的开发者的 25 万美元罚款和和解。bZx 是一个用于去中心化借贷的协议。2020 年，bZx 协议因为代码漏洞导致损失了数十万美元的加密货币。同时，CFTC 也对 Ooki DAO 提起诉讼，Ooki DAO 是一个去中心化自治组织，在 2021 年被用来治理该协议。CFTC 在一份法庭文件中说：“DAO 不能免于执法，也不能不受惩罚地违反法律。”这是 CFTC 首次起诉一个去中心化自治组织，也包括治理代币的持有人。


消息来源：The Block



老王点评：可能很多人会有错觉，加密货币是匿名的，DAO 是法不责众的。




调查显示老板们认为员工在家干活少

微软的一项新调查显示，老板和员工对在家工作时的生产力有根本性的分歧。87% 的员工认为他们在家工作的效率和在办公室一样高，甚至更高，但 80% 的经理不同意此看法。这项调查询问了 11 个国家的 2 万多名员工。在 LinkedIn 上通常有大约 1400 或 1500 万个职位，在疫情之前，其中约有 2% 涉及远程工作。几个月前，这一比例为 20%，而本月已降至 15%。


消息来源：BBC



老王点评：反正我在家就不想干活。]]></summary>

Seth Kenlon
Sat, 09/24/2022 - 03:00

            
Databases are tools to store information in an organized but flexible way. A spreadsheet is essentially a database, but the constraints of a graphical application render most spreadsheet applications useless to programmers. With Edge and IoT devices becoming significant target platforms, developers need powerful but lightweight solutions for storing, processing, and querying large amounts of data. One of my favourite combinations is the PostgreSQL database and Lua bindings, but the possibilities are endless. Whatever language you use, Postgres is a great choice for a database, but you need to know some basics before adopting it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[开源库 GObject 和 libsoup 做了很多工作，因此你可以专注于使用 C 语言开发神奇的应用。


GLib 对象系统Object System（GObject）是一个为 C 语言提供灵活且可扩展的面向对象框架的库。在这篇文章中，我将使用该库的 2.4 版本进行演示。

GObject 库继承了 ANSI C 标准，拥有一些常见的数据类型，例如：


gchar：字符型

guchar：无符号字符型

gunichar：32 位定宽 Unicode 字符型

gboolean：布尔型

gint8、gint16、gint32、gint64：有符号 8、16、32 和 64 位整数

guint8、guint16、guint32、guint64：无符号 8、16、32 和 64 位整数

gfloat：IEEE 754 标准单精度浮点数

gdouble：IEEE 754 标准双精度浮点数

gpointer：泛指针


函数指针

GObject 库还引入了类和接口的类型和对象体系。之所以可以，是因为 ANSI C 语言可以理解函数指针。

你可以这样做来声明函数指针：

void (*my_callback)(gpointer data);


首先，你需要给变量 my_callback 赋值：

void my_callback_func(gpointer data)
{
  //do something
}

my_callback = my_callback_func;


函数指针 my_callback 可以这样来调用：

gpointer data;
data = g_malloc(512 * sizeof(gint16));
my_callback(data);

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RDNA 2 GPU 的 Linux 用户可以使用 AMD 的 AMDVLK GPUOpen 开源 Vulkan 驱动程序。


用于 Radeon RX 6000 GPU 的 AMDVLK GPUOpen 图形驱动程序在过去一周改进了对 64 位光线追踪的支持。这涵盖了支持 RDNA 2 图形的 APU 以及桌面/移动 GPU。所有平台上的所有 AMD Vulkan 驱动程序现在都支持硬件光线追踪，包括 Mesa3D RADV、AMDVLK GPUOpen 和 AMDGPU-PRO。

GPU 光线追踪库（GPURT）的基础是一个 C++ 接口。根据其用法和依赖关系，公共接口被拆分为各种头文件。用户可以在官方的 GitHub 仓库上了解更多信息，它还包括了 RDNA 2 GPURT 的结构细分。最新的 AMDVLK GPUOpen v-2022.Q3.4 信息如下：

更新和新功能：


扩展 Navi2x 的 64 位光线追踪功能。

将 Vulkan 标头升级到版本 1.3.225

游戏性能优化，包括《荣耀战魂》和《奇点灰烬》


已解决的问题：


dEQP-VK.api.copy_and_blit.*.resolve_image.whole_copy_before_resolving_transfer.* 新版本 CTS 失败。

dEQP-VK.pipeline.creation 缓存控件有一个 CTS 警告。

Ubuntu 22.04 上的 Firefox 损坏

VulkanInfo 崩溃，管道缓存已停用

RX 6800 上的 RGP 测试套件故障


新的改进包括 GPU 光线追踪库（GPURT），它将包括使用 HLSL 之类的着色器在光线追踪中看到的边界体积层次（BVH）的构造和排序处理。这个库将提供一个标准库来改进图形渲染并引入更多的统一性。DirectX 12 DXR 也将与新库一起使用。

对 GPU 光线追踪（GPURT）库的描述为“一个静态库（源代码交付），为支持 DXR（DirectX 12）和 Vulkan® RT API 的 AMD 驱动程序提供与光线追踪相关的功能。” 该公司的平台抽象库用于构建库（PAL）。

用户可参考最新 AMDVLK GPUOpen v-2022.Q3.4 升级的安装说明。用户在更新任何软件、硬件或驱动程序之前应备份所有相关数据，以免丢失重要文件。

为了让最新的 Linux 驱动程序为 AMD、Intel 和 NVIDIA 技术做好准备，已经投入了大量工作，这些技术都是在今年第一季度推出的。

Distributed databases are common for many reasons. They increase reliability, redundancy, and performance. Apache ShardingSphere is an open source framework that enables you to transform any database into a distributed database. Since the release of ShardingSphere 5.0.0, DistSQL (Distributed SQL) has provided dynamic management for the ShardingSphere ecosystem.
In this article, I demonstrate a data sharding scenario in which DistSQL's flexibility allows you to create a distributed database. At the same time, I show some syntax sugar to simplify operating procedures, allowing your potential users to choose their preferred syntax.
A series of DistSQL statements are run through practica…]]></summary>

Seth Kenlon

When you write an application, it's common to require data storage. Sometimes you're storing assets your application needs to function, and other times you're storing user data, including preferences and save data. One way to store data is in a database, and in order to communicate between your code and a database, you need a database binding or connector for your language. For Java, a common database connector is JDBC (Java database connectivity.)
1. Install Java
Of course, to develop with Java you must also have Java installed. I recommend SDKman for Linux, macOS, and WSL or Cygwin. For Windows, you can download OpenJDK from developers.redhat.com.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这个大众觉醒的时代，我们常常听到「我们需要探索自我，了解自己」。但是，假设我们很粗暴地把人分为三种：认为不需要寻找自我的人（或不知道「寻找自我」重要性的人）、正在寻找自我的人、以及找到了自我的人，第一类人是绝大多数，第二类是少数，第三类是少数中的少数。
这其实也对应了我们认识自我的三个阶段。
第一阶段是我们需要觉醒，意识到探索自我的重要性。
为什么探索自我对每个人都很重要？
人是需要意义驱动的动物，我们天生有实现自身价值的冲动。但每个人的价值、优势是不同的。我的性格是怎样的？我想做的事情是什么？对我来说，什么最重要？我未来的方向是什么？我想过上怎么样的生活？我的价值实现在哪？这些问题如果得不到解答，短短一生很容易忙忙碌碌、随着大流就这样过去了，实在可惜。
项飙在《把自己作为方法》中说：

（瓶颈的问题）是回到自己作为一个边缘者、回到我是谁的问题。想清楚究竟我能做什么，我跟世界的关系是什么。我认为世界上所有的人都有这个问题，都得搞清楚自己是谁，否则都会有这种危机，除非完全盲目地被主流裹挟进去。

当我们意识到探索自我的需求之后，我们还需要方法，这就来到了第二阶段——开始寻找自我。但我感觉，很多人对于探索自我的方法却没有什么头绪。
困难之处，在于「自我」是非常复杂的，我们之所以是今天这样，受到了童年经历、社交媒体、朋友亲人、国家文化等等各种因素的影响，这些影响之中大部分更是在日常不知不觉之中就成为了我们的一部分，所以无论是从横向（各种因素的复杂性）和纵向（性格和价值观形成过程的复杂性）看，自我都是极其复杂的。
但好在，这几年通过各种各样的渠道和自证，我积累了一些有用的、可执行的方法，想在这里分享给你。
再多读几本书
阅读有什么用呢？学习知识肯定是好处之一，可是看完可能就忘了；拓展眼界也是的，可是没去亲身经历还是差了一点。
那最大的用处是什么呢？我认为， 是读自己。

Alan Formy-Duval
Thu, 09/22/2022 - 03:00

            
Setting up Git on Linux is simple, but here are the five things I do to get the perfect configuration:
Create global configuration
Set default name
Set default email address
Set default branch name
Set default editor
I manage my code, shell scripts, and documentation versioning using Git. This means that for each new project I start, the first step is to create a directory for its content and make it into a Git repository:
$ mkdir newproject
cd newproject
git init

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[个人日程管理的需求
在选择日程管理的形式或者app的时候，我的要求很简单：即先确定需求，再按照需求探索日程管理方式。我对日程管理的需求有几点：

任务与日程要在同一个页面；
尽可能随手拿起就能使用；
有较大的自由度，即可以根据个人需求添加备注等；
要能够自上而下地「俯视」整个日程管理过程；
随时可以逃离。

根据这几点需求，我开始了自己的日程管理尝试1。
日程管理尝试
1. 纸质日程本
本科时期，还在用着黑莓9790、z10等一些「非主流」手机，他们没办法与电脑形成一个良好的生态系统，所以没有习惯用他们来做日程管理，而是使用传统的纸质日程本。
当时，已经在用Moleskine的单行笔记本做日记本，对M家的本子很有好感，尤其是口袋本，非常便携。出于一种仪式感的传承，我开始尝试M家的周记本：本子摊开，左边是一周的日程记录，可以记录有确定时间的日程，也可以记录只固定日期的日程；右边是一整面的横线页面，可以写下一些备忘事项，例如可能需要本周或者下周要做的事情等，也可以记录本周的一些打卡事项。

后来尝试了M家特有的400页超厚日程本，一天一页，每一页都是当天从8点到22点的日程记录。本子非常厚，携带有点不方便；记录是方便许多，能写的位置也多了很多，但因为不是每天都有排满的日程，一些琐事写进去也没意思，最终本子留了许多空，总感觉有点浪费，尤其是年终总结的时候觉得似乎是虚度了时光一样。

后来也尝试过MUJI的月记本，但是总感觉没有周记本好用，我便回归Moleskine的周记本，直到我后来舍弃它。
2. 手机自带日程管理工具
舍弃纸质日程本的原因有两个：

设备和系统升级了，从「非主流」机升级到了带有安卓系统的Blackberry Keyone，自带的日历强大了很多；
当时正在读研究生，我们的课比谁都多，每天都被课程排满，而这些课程都写进纸质笔记本里不太可能，只把课程外的待办事项写进本…]]></summary>

Python, one of the most popular programming languages, requires an interpreter to execute the instructions defined by the Python code. In contrast to other languages, which compile directly into machine code, it’s up to the interpreter to read Python code and translate its instructions for the CPU performing the related actions. There are several interpreters out there, and in this article, I’ll take a look at a few of them.
Primer to interpreters
When talking about the Python interpreter, it’s usually the /usr/bin/python binary being referred to. That lets you execute a .py file.

If you have notes to yourself scattered throughout your hard drive, you might need a notes application to collect and organize your personal reminders. A notes system can help you track ideas, important tasks, and works in progress. A popular application that isn't open source is Notion, but here are two options that respect your privacy and data.
Standard Notes
Standard Notes is an open source (AGPL 3.0 license) notes application featuring a password manager, a to-do list, and, of course, a great system for writing and storing notes.
One of the most important things about taking notes is finding them again, so organization is critical. Standard Notes uses an intuitive and natural tagging syste…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[上一篇《exping：一个地图创作工具是怎么诞生的？》 和大家分享了 exping 的诞生故事后。感谢大家的支持与建议，也感谢少数派的推荐，让更多的人认识了 exping ，其中也有投资人、媒体关注到了我们。这是意料之外的收获。时隔3个月，我们有了许多的变化与提升。在这段时间里，也有更多的机会去接触用户，进行深入的交流，从中也更清晰我们的产品定位，以及我们的使命。
「地图」就像一张画布，是另类的创作载体
从地图诞生以来，大家对地图的认识，更多是作为「导航指引」用途。其中涉及了不少的学科，如「地图学」、「地理学」、「测绘学」、「遥感技术」等等。根据地图的应用场景，结合这些学科专业，绘制不同的专用地图。
因此，地图创作对大家来说似乎需要有一定的专业要求。而 exping 的诞生始于让每个人可以轻松、容易地呈现自己的品味地图。地图就像一幅画的画布，一个另类的创作载体。（欢迎看看小编写的文章《emoji + 地图 = exping》）在此之上以标记「点」，绘制「路线」，表达基于地理位置上的故事。「地图」作为重要的画布，重点在于可塑性，如何帮助创作者对地点进行多样性的表达。那或许一般的地图不足以满足这些需求，借此，这次我们和设计师聊聊，exping 专属地图的一些设计心路历程。
 

作为 exping 的设计师，你怎么理解 exping？
当大家还在以图文的方式分享一个好地方的时候，exping 开始将地图作为主视角。 Explorer 可以方便快捷地添加去过、计划要去的地方以及设计路线，简单或隆重地补充对该地点的评价，上传相关照片。
通过这种更直接的方式，将你的数据传递给你的观众，大幅度减少了“这是哪里？”，“我也想去”，“环境怎么样？”等问答游戏。
在这之前，exping 的地图风格是怎样的？
在 exping v0.1~0.3 的地图风格从 Light （简约）到 Stree…]]></summary>

I was looking for information about the health of my laptop battery when I stumbled upon inxi. It's a command line system information tool that provides a wealth of information about your Linux computer, whether it's a laptop, desktop, or server.
The inxi command is licensed with the GPLv3, and many Linux distributions include it. According to its Git repository: "inxi strives to support the widest range of operating systems and hardware, from the most simple consumer desktops, to the most advanced professional hardware and servers."
Documentation is robust, and the project maintains a complete man page online. Once installed, you can access the man page on your system with the man inxi command.

Technology is a little famous for coming up with "buzzwords." Other industries do it, too, of course. "Story-driven" and "rules light" tabletop games are a big thing right now, "deconstructed" burgers and burritos are a big deal in fine dining. The problem with buzzwords in tech, though, is that they potentially actually affect your life. When somebody calls an application "secure," to influence you to use their product, there's an implicit promise being made. "Secure" must mean that something's secure. It's safe for you to use and trust. The problem is, the word "secure" can actually refer to any number of things, and the tech industry often uses it as such a general term that it becomes …]]></summary>

平时一无聊下来，偶尔会通过消费购物，来提起自己的生活兴致，买东西从挑选，到想象自身使用场景，再到下单盼望着快递，最后拆封这个过程，能在很长一段日子里给自己提供着生活的兴致。而有些时候，反省下觉得单纯是无聊想买买买，而不是使用需求强烈促使我去购物。自觉这种动机是不健康的，同时也很好奇为什么有这种心理，于是便在网络推荐下接触到了这本书——《超市里的原始人》，想借此机会，弄清楚什么是消费主义，对我这种自以为不健康的消费行为如何解剖。
从看到书名中的「原始人」开始，我就期待着书中内容将追根到底消费的欲望最原始的动机是什么。首先需要引用一下在生物学中对人作为社会性灵长类动物特点的描述：

人类在进化过程中形成了许多小范围的社会集体，身在其中，你的形象和地位就是至关重要的，这已经不仅仅是为了满足生存的需求，还是为了吸引伴侣、娱乐朋友和抚育后代。

消费这件事情之所以扯到这么遥远和深层的角度呢，是因为作者主张需要从进化心理学的角度才能透彻地了解消费主义的根源，消费者虽然会半自觉地设法炫耀出财富、地位和品味，但真正想要展现的是更深层次的心理特质（比如善良、智慧和创意）和生理特质（比如生育能力、强壮、美貌）。
《超市里的原始人》中的三个关键论点：

人试图展示自身特质的本能与消费主义关系紧密。
我们用于识别关键人类特质和情感的社交感知系统经过漫长的进化历程变得准确高效，能将所有能收集到的不同暗示聚集起来，察觉出一个人的身体、脸部、语言和行为。
消费主义在很大程度上就是一种画蛇添足的行为。我们得到了有惊人适应力的人类自我展示的能力，即语言、智慧、善良、创造力和美丽，然后却忘记了如何用它们来结交朋友、吸引配偶和获取声望。相反，我们却依赖通过教育、工作、消费获得的商品 和服务来向他人展示自己的个人特质。这些高成本信号大都是多余的或是误导性的， 所以别人通常都会对其视而不见。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你用过人工智能写作工具吗？前两个月，我看到了一些AI写作工具推出了文章续写功能。

只要你写上一篇文章的开头和结尾，智能系统就能自动生成一篇完整的文章。虽然现在技术还不成熟，积累的样本数据还不够完善，写出的内容还是会被挑剔，但是我总感觉排布好内容逻辑是迟早的事情。
在那个时候，AI就能代替我们写作吗？
作为内容创作者，我们还有活路吗？现在能帮人进行AI写作的工具有很多，从媒体报道、工作汇报这些角度看，人工智能会逐步替代人工写作。它只追求客观报道和逻辑推导，但无法完成偏主观价值判断的内容生产，因为AI不能代替的是我们对内容的「审美」。
人工智能与审美
前段时间AI绘画掀起了一阵火热，只要输入一些文字和句子，表达画的风格和内容，AI就能自动生产出一副艺术作品。有的画真的能与大神媲美，吊打国内外大部分艺术工作者。但是，这里的问题是，这个作品从「点子」到「作品」之间，完全忽略了过程。
怎么判断一个作品已经做到最好了？还能不能更好？这一笔触能不能再调一调？那一个色块能不能再深一些？如果单独抠几个细节，那是调整，如果从头开始就抠细节，那就是「创作」。
AI写作能根据你前面写的一个词、一段话，自动生成出后面的句子和篇章，但是它对于一个真正想表达的人来说，生产出的段落总会让人差强人意，甚至因为一个字的误用就导致表达结果与表达目的南辕北辙。
说到底，AI写作只能成为我们的工具，是基于创作者的审美的工具。倘若作者的审美和沉淀不够，反而会出现被工具主导，甚至被代替的困境。如同普通人去使用AI绘画一样，对绘画细节失控，除了标题能自己把控，后面的笔触、构图、用色等细节都和自己无关。如果我们本身就懂绘画，那么还可以去微调，但当我们什么都不懂的时候，剩下的只有无尽的赞叹。通过AI生产出了一个远超自己能力范畴的作品，或者说，它远远超出了我们对作品的审美极限。所以，无法对它进行细节的判定。
就如同我们在写作…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[与其说双链是笔记软件，不如说他们是知识管理软件或思维工具。而这个认知上的错位便是导致目前双链饱受争议的原因之一。

双链是个伪概念？
双链笔记软件目前的争议不少，大家对其的批判也非常实际，可谓是针针见血：

双链的底层逻辑尚未普及，用户无所适从。链接有什么用？哪些应该链接？
notion、语雀、印象笔记都能一定程度上双向链接各种文章。虽然稍微简化了一些，但好像也能用啊。
界面太“硬核”了，不优雅，不美观，基本没有办法给别人看。
没有办法共享和协作。
导出十分麻烦，有时候还要靠插件。
各种命令、快捷键、插件，学习成本高。
代码程度较高，没有代码基础的人被劝退。
知识图谱功能基本只是用来装逼，东西一多基本没法看。

可以发现，当我们以“笔记软件”的角度来看待双链，它和目前各种成熟的笔记软件相比差太多了。看着甚至像尚未完成就拿出来给人用的Alpha版本软件，非常粗糙，体验极差。
但是，如果我们换一个视角，以“知识管理软件”和“思维工具”的角度来看待双链，结果可能会完全不同。而我认为这才是双链的核心优势。
双链的核心优势——知识管理和思维辅助工具
1、信息颗粒度更细，便于细化和延展
个人认为，信息粒度是双链笔记最核心的优势。比起印象笔记以"篇"为单位、notion以“块”为单位，双链笔记是以“点”为单位。这就以为着，我们可以将大块的知识细化为一个个相对独立的知识点。同时，在细化的过程中，我们逐渐把各个知识点从原有的语境中解放（抽象）出来，进而形成能够在长时间的考验下保留下来的知识。这样，当日后遇到新的情景的时候，我们也能迅速知识结构，以支持新的目标。

具体而言，以roam research为例，在使用过程中，你任何时候都可以用 [[]] 来关联另一个概念或者页面，或用 (()) 来关联一个句子或一个块。
2、记录成本低
大部分双链笔记都是基于大纲笔记的，即整体的框架类似于bull…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在正式开始说体验前，先谈谈索尼在 9 月初正式发布的全新真·小屏旗舰——Xperia 5 IV，在设计上融合了 Xperia 1 系列的特点，总算是更换了硬朗的边框以及磨砂质感的后盖玻璃，可以说完全契合个人的审美爱好，更不用说破天荒加入了无线充电，我对 Xperia 5 III 最不满意的两点都解决了，还有什么理由不买呢？加上最近在各种视频网站看到关于 Xperia 1 IV、5 III 等机器的吐槽，于是就想在 5 IV 到手前，和大家分享一下我的使用体验。
为何购买 Xperia 5 III
说起来在今年入手 5 III 之前，我在用的是三星 Galaxy S22 Ultra，S22U 真的什么都好，拍照、系统啥的我都挺满意，而且外观更是延续了曾经最爱的 Xperia XZ Premium 的神韵，当时一发售就冲了。只是在实际使用时，总会觉得这机器实在是太大了，单手用太累，可我又不像当年用黑莓 Passport 那样充满喜爱，对其体积无下限容忍，于是乎就又考虑换台趁手的小屏旗舰机器。
然后说起现在的小屏机器，基本上没得选，iPhone 就只有 SE 和 12、13 mini，Android 这边能看上眼的就是魅族 18、Galaxy S22 和 Xperia 5 III。综合来看，12、13 mini 因为刘海直接 pass，SE 电量实在担忧，魅族 18 不防水也 pass，只能让 5 III PK S22。作为一个曾经的 Xperia 5 用户，对于 5 III 可以说是完全不担心，唯一的问题就是臭名昭著的火龙 888，但 S22 用的是 8 Gen1，这对卧龙凤雏就随便吧，毕竟我都能接受 S22U 的 8 Gen1 了。最后特意跑去三星官方店实际上手体验 S22 的感觉，由于 S22 70.6mm 的宽度握持时有点撑手不舒服，于是乎 68mm 宽度的 Xperia…]]></summary>

我是一个拥有七年工龄的年过三十的打工人，base 在北京。
工作的前五年，我任职于一家外企。凭借着年轻和朝九晚六，工作的大多数时候我都能轻松应付，并没有把运动当回事儿。工作五年后我跳槽到了互联网行业，工作强度和工作时长陡增，对体力和精力都有了新的考验，因此运动也不得不提上了日程。
但是运动这件事只有想法是没办法做成的，我花了一年多的时间断断续续走了很多弯路。三天打鱼两天晒网经常发生，一下子荒废半个月的情况也并不少见。而最终让我养成运动习惯的是我狠下心氪金，配齐了各种运动辅助工具，并在各种工具的综合作用下，让运动成为了我生活习惯。
此文写作时间为 2022 年 9 月 19 日，我刚刚收到了 Apple Watch 发送给我的「最坚持奖 - 22 天」的奖章。一个习惯的养成需要 21 天，这个奖章也让我动了念头，想把这个过程分享出来，于是就有了这篇文章。
2022 年 9 月 19 日 收到最坚持奖 22 天
我的典型一天：工作日运动
时间选择
工作日大家都疲于奔命，很难抽出大块时间来专门运动。所以选择适合自己的运动时间很重要。
我首先尝试的是下班后跟着 Keep App 来做一些运动。但是遇到了两个阻碍：一个是下班时间不固定，有时候到家已经九点多了，不方便再做剧烈运动，会直接影响睡眠质量；另一个是有时候晚饭吃了比较多的主食，所以整个人头昏脑胀的，大多数时候只想躺着刷剧，并没有意志力再爬起来。
然后我尝试了在中午的时间运动。我会早十五分钟锁定电脑屏幕赶去健身房，并点好一个定时派送的外卖（运动完后食堂已经关门）。这样实行了快半年时间…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[起初，我从未感受到我妈对于衰老的恐惧。直到大概五六年前我家重新装修房子的时候，我妈坚持要在他们卧室的厕所里装一个马桶，后来问了原因才知道，她大概是觉得以后自己老了，万一腿脚不方便了，用马桶会轻松很多。从那一刻起，我才猛然发觉这种隐秘的恐惧。
第七次全国人口普查的的数据显示，目前中国60岁及以上的人口数量已超2.6亿，这个人数占总人数的18.7%。这就意味着，有相当一部分老人正在经历着这种关于衰老的隐秘恐惧，还会有越来越多的人陷入这种关于衰老的恐惧。
为了回应这些恐惧，很多人可能最先想到的是“适老化改造”。当然，适老化改造是一个相当大的问题域，本文目前所要探讨的仅仅是房屋的适老化改造，特别是对现有的城镇房屋进行一些“修补性”的适老化改造。
为什么要进行房屋适老化改造？
我们需要先回答一个问题：为什么我们要率先对“房屋”这样一个区域进行适老化改造呢？这个问题的答案有很多。
首先是出于目前国内养老格局的考虑。国内养老事业呈现出一种所谓的“9073”的格局。也就是说，90%左右的老年人居家养老，大约7%的老年人需要依托社区进行养老，最后3%左右的老年人将入住养老院。这意味着大多数老人会在自己的家中度过大部分的晚年时光。这几乎是最适合老人，同时也是最经济的养老方式。
其次是出于老人活动范围的考虑。随着年龄的增长，老人的社会活动范围会逐渐缩小，老人对于居住空间的依赖程度也会越来越高。这意味着，居住环境成为老人晚年生活最重要的空间载体，居住条件的好坏将会直接影响老人的生活质量。[1]
再次是出于老年人人体工学的考虑。据老年人人体工学的研究，在衰老过程中人体的尺寸也会发生变化。医学研究资料显示：人在28-30岁时身高最高，35-40岁之后逐渐出现衰减，70岁时身高会比年轻时减少2.5%-3%。[2]这就意味着，随着居住者年龄的增长，房屋也应该发生一些改变。
所以，出于上述的种种原因，除了大…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前些日子，我给你介绍了本地使用 Stable Diffusion 人工智能绘画工具的方法（如何在你的 M1/M2 Mac 本地运行 Stable Diffusion？）。不少小伙伴们反馈说玩儿得很开心。

不过也有不开心的，因为手头儿没有 M1/M2 的 Mac 电脑。

是不是因为设备限制，就只能眼巴巴看着别人体验新科技成果呢？
当然不是。人工智能技术的普及化，已经是科技发展的潮流趋势了。我今天给你介绍一个不需要安装任何应用的体验方式。而且，更好的消息是，你都不用把自己的想法翻译成英文了，直接输入中文就行。
这是个微信小程序，叫做「盗梦师」。开发者是西湖大学蓝振忠老师团队。
我这里给你做个演示。
今早我看到有人分享了一段视频，是喷气式背包的实验场景。很有意思。

于是我就在朋友圈发了一番感慨：

有了这玩意儿，上班堵车不是事儿了。

感慨之后，觉得光用文字表达不够形象，刚好就可以用「盗梦师」画出来。
于是我打开小程序，输入了这样一段话：

一个背着喷气式背包的中年人在交通拥堵的马路上轻松自在飞行

这里注意你可以选择绘画的类型。我选择的是「赛博朋克」，我觉得和主题很搭。

然后是选择画家风格。我对赛博朋克艺术家不了解，于是设置成为「不限定」。

下面还有一个选项，是画面的长宽比例。我觉得对于展示的画作来说， 16:9 感觉上比较好。
好了，做了这些设定后，就可以直接画了。

这里需要等上几秒钟即可，比本地 M1 Mac 运行起 Stable Diffusion 来快多了。画做好了，你感觉怎么样呢？

有了这样的形象画面，朋友圈里的评论一下子就丰富了起来，例如：

假发套得粘的紧一点

以及：

当姑娘们画好了妆，做好了头发，美美的在街上走着，然后突然被人用喷气背包的风吹乱的时候，你猜她们会不会捡石头把它打下来

我觉得，这些担心，都不无道理，值得背包开发商们认真记录和讨论。
如果你感兴趣的话，直接打开微信，搜索这个小程序试试看吧。上文图中也包含了二维码可以直达。目前阶段，每天有 5 次免费创作机会。然后每分享给一位好友，双方可以获得 20 次创作额度。
当然，我也尝试了一些其他的图画，例如中国风的「雪中山寺古钟」。

雪、山都齐全了，只是寺庙在哪里？找了半天没看到，哈哈。如果你玩儿过 Stable Diffusion ，应该知道很多时候你需要多画几张，从中选择更合适的图画。所以我准备等明天有了新的额度，再用同样的文本，多画几张对比看看。
欢迎把你的尝试结果和经验心得分享到留言区，咱们一起交流讨论。
祝人工智能绘画愉快！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[播客的形式和内容日益丰富，其中不乏一些可以与文章、视频媲美的信息价值和密度。我们会通过剪藏、截图来收集文字和图像，然而对于声音为媒介的播客，是否你也产生了“要是能把这段单独截出来就好了”的想法？
作为半个播客爱好者，我目前一直在使用 Spotify，无论是设备进度同步，还是UI交互，播客的基础功能都算基本满足，唯一遗憾是当听到精彩的片段时，没有裁剪和收藏片段的功能。
因此开始在市面上寻找这样的应用，我的需求算比较清晰，首先必须要有片段截取功能；其次需要能创建公开链接，无论用于分享朋友还是收集； 最后软件的播客功能需要能过得去，如果能跨平台也是加分项；
在市面上找了一轮，大体能满足要求的找到了三款，下面就通过比较 Snipd、Airr 和 QlipCast 三个播客应用，给有类似需求的读者做参考。
💡 喜马拉雅也包含片段截取的“卡擦”功能，但由于广告泛滥和部分内容限制，我个人不纳入考虑，不介意的朋友可以尝试喜马拉雅，从功能齐全、多端同步、网络稳定上都是较优选择，注意敏感内容即可。
   
具体比较
1、整体设计风格
Snipd 整体风格和 Spotify 相近，大线条的图标以及深蓝渐变和绿色的色彩；
Airr 界面简洁干净，主要以黑白交错为主，首层只有两个模块：第一个主要是看自己和他人分享的一些片段，第二块包含关注或订阅的播客、听过的节目和创建过的片段。
QilpCast 作为最近更新已经是两年前的软件，UI 虽无法媲美前两者，也还算得差强人意。
左：Snipd；中：Airr；右：QlipCast
2、片段创建和分享功能
这部分的功能可以说是我的需求核心，功能对比也聚焦在主要的操作流上，即：裁剪与创建片段→ 管理与编辑片段 → 分享/导出
💡 截取的片段名称在各软件叫法各异，Snip（Snipd），Quote（Airr）和 Qlip（QlipCast），为阅读理解便利，以…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[打算开一个新的系列「Obsidian 综述」，不同于「玩转 Obsidian」系列，「综述」更关注 Obsidian 的功能和插件的使用，而「玩转」系列更成体系，它们的区别：

综述系列重点在「介绍」，针对 Obsidian 近期的新功能、新插件、新主题进行体验。并在使用过一段时间之后，进行简单的介绍和归纳。
玩转系列重点在「方法论」，是在吃透了「综述」内容之后，结合自己的体验进行总结和提炼。

v0.16 重磅更新
最近 Obsidian 重磅发布了 v0.16 ，当然目前还属于「内部预览」版，只有付费支持的用户才能体验，不过大家也不用着急，通常「公开版」也不会等太久。
最大的升级是「重新设计了 Obsidian 的界面」带来了「标签组」等重磅功能，官方内部对这次新 UI 称为 Dragonglass（龙晶），从体验上看完全颠覆了从前我对 Obsidian 界面和易用性上的感知，贴几张个人使用的图大家感受一下：

这次 UI 升级是重头戏，本篇不会事无巨细的介绍所有升级点，我会挑选几条个人最满意的地方跟大家展开介绍，如果您想了解本次所有升级功能可以参考官方文档：

中文介绍
英文介绍

工作区支持「标签组」
本次升级引入了「标签组」概念，「标签组」简单理解，就像我们在「浏览器」上使用「标签组」一样，在 Obsidian 中通过多个「标签组」每个组多个「标签页」，可以较大限度的实现「平铺散列」的阅读方式，如图：
 

「标签组」的优势在于一方面我们可以通过快速切换「标签组」内的不同「标签页」，提高「信息摄入速度」；另一方面「标签组」也极大拓展了我们打开「笔记」的数量。这两点优势在「整理知识」和「创意输出」的时候非常有用。
在升级前我们只能采用「下图」中的方式打开多篇「笔记」，这种方式最大的问题是「最多同时可以看到 2篇笔记全貌」，如果想要看到更多需要将笔记拖拽到「中间区域」…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[小众消息的冯大辉前两天推送了一篇很有意思的文章，大概是探讨一个B站视频对微信存储机制可能存在的误解。文中提出了一个实验方法，看到做了试验可能会有奖品，我眼睛一下放光，不如就趁此机会做几个试验，好好探讨一下微信在iOS上的文件存储机制，包括：

转发文件是否会占用额外的存储空间？
从同一人处多次接收同一份文件是否会占用额外的空间？
从不同人处多次接收同一份文件是否会占用额外的空间？
微信和WeChat在以上这些问题上是否存在差异？
同一台手机上的不同微信账号接收的同一文件是否占用额外存储空间？

试验的环境是iOS 14.8.1、iPhone 11、微信8.0.28。首先我们删除手机上的微信重新安装。登录一个WeChat小号（小号A）。此时微信占用的空间是少的可怜的752.2MB，其中数据占244.5MB。我提前准备好了一个Ubuntu的iso镜像（880MB）。将它发送给这个小号。下载后重启手机，可以看到，微信占用的空间变成了1.77GB，其中数据占1.26GB。多出来大约1GB的空间，可能是除了文件以外的缓存、其他需要的程序和资源文件。
接收文件前后的微信
接下来我们正式开始实验。我们讲接收到的文件转发给三个不同的小号。重启手机，可以看到，如冯大辉所料，微信所占用的存储空间并没有增加。依然是1.77GB（数据1.26GB)。微信显然做了最基本的文件存储去重。
所占空间没有变化
接下来，我从另一个微信号将刚刚发送的文件再次转发给小号三遍。当我点进新发送的文件时，看到需要接受文件，我有一种不详的预感。难道微信真会重新接收一遍文件？所幸，当我点击接收文件后，文件在一瞬间就接收完成了。显然，微信也伴有服务器端的去重，在服务器上的同一份文件，在本地并不会接收多次。重启手机也可以看到，微信占用的空间并无增加。
看似要重新接收，实际所占空间没有明显变化
按照这个逻辑，即使是不同的人转发给我的同一份文件，应该也不会需要重复下载，或是占用额外的空间。我试着用另外两个小号（小号B、小号C）将同一份文件转发给小号A。虽然也显示需要接收文件，但同刚才一样，一瞬间就完成了接收。再次重启手机，微信所占用的空间依旧没有变化。
不过，刚才验证的情况中，虽然是多个账号转发给一个小号，但是微信很容易在服务器端追溯到，这些文件的源头是同一个。那假如各个账号是各自上传的同一份文件，微信在服务器端是否也有去重能力呢？为此，我在另一台小米手机上登录小号B与小号C，各自发送同一份文件给小号Ａ。发送文件的时间较长。这似乎足以让人判断出，微信大概没有类似百度网盘的文件去重判断。
然而出人意料的是，小号A还是一瞬间就完成了文件的接收。重启手机后也可以看到，微信所占用的空间并没有明显增加（总计1.83GB，数据1.32GB）。这说明至少在服务器端，微信确实能够判断出一份文件是否曾经上传过。而缺少类似网盘的秒传功能，可能是微信本身没有相关功能，也可能是Android端微信需要优化。
实际所占空间依然只有一份文件大小
出于好奇，我又尝试从小号B发送一份内容相同，只有文件名不同的文件，看看微信的查重是否基于文件名，或是基于文件本身。经过等待漫长的发送，如我所料，接收只在一瞬间就完成了。由此可知，微信的文件去重基于内容，并不依赖名字。
不同文件名也不会多占用空间
上面测试的都是同一账号下的情况。那么，同一台手机上的不同账号间又是怎样呢？我尝试在刚刚登录小号A的手机上切换了一个微信账号B。可以看到，这次转发收到的相同文件，需要重新接收下载。重启手机也能看到微信的占用空间变为3.8G（数据3.29G）。不过在这一微信账号下，同一文件仍然只需要下载保存一份，再次收到就能秒存。同时利用这个微信账号简单试了一下，我发现以上WeChat的文件存储机制对微信也同样成立。
实打实地需要下载，所占空间也倍增了
到这里，我们可以基本得出结论，iOS的微信文件存储去重做得还是比较令人满意的。同一账号下的同一个文件，只要内容相同，就只会在本地留存一份。未来微信团队可以努力的方向是不同账号间的文件存储去重。
另外值得一提的是，微信大概是真的有在代码层面实现去重，而非依赖APFS的CoW特性。因为即使只占一份空间，iPhone在统计容量时也会重复计算一个文件的多次拷贝。通过多次复制粘贴同一份文件，你能很容易地复现苹果的这个Bug：
苹果什么时候出4T iPhone？
在我原本的设想中，我写出这篇文章后，与其拿到那500元钱，我更想获得一个与Fenng交流的机会，说服他微信是一个糟糕的产品。但转念一下，即使我做到了，也并不能改变得了微信这个产品本身，以及我们必须使用它的环境。更何况再一看那篇文章，是要证明微信没有去重才能拿到那笔钱。是我审题不细了😀

如果你觉得我的这篇文章不错，也欢迎你阅读我之前有关微信的两篇文章：虎头蛇尾的《微信戒断实验》与尝试减少微信占用空间的《微微微信怎么办》。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[智能家居。我的理解是：智能的、易用的，能给生活提供极大便利的，才能称之为「智能家居」。
大家好，我是少数派新晋 Martix 作者，目前从事主要以政府项目为主的运营。作为我在少数派潜水多年后的第一篇内容，就是如何利用极低的成本打造属于你的智能家居。
内容背景

本文将以「Home Assistant」智能家居平台（简称 「Home Assistant」，下同），开展工作，并通过 iOS 的 HomeKit 及 Android 自身的设备管理器来控制智能家居配件。关于「Home Assistant」的详细介绍，如何部署及安装插件的教学，少数派已有前辈进行了详细说明，这里不再赘述。

需强调的是，笔者通过 Debian 10 进行部署，版本是 2022.3.8，预装插件与其他方法略有出入。
由于系统过于老旧，「Home Assistant」的 Home Assistant Supervisor 不再支持 Debian 10 ，但使用下来，似乎实际上没有影响。
重复造轮子？

既然前辈已经在少数派中发表了基于「Home Assistant」构建的「智能家居」内容，为何笔者仍然要以此作为在少数派的第一篇内容？不是前辈撰写的内容不好，只是内容方向不同，本文将基于 YAML 语言来定制属于自己的「智能家居」。
本文将尽可能使用通俗的语言，力求做到即使每一位读者未曾接触也不能理解 YAML 语言的情况下能码出自己想要的配置文件，但由于笔者对 YAML 语法也未能做到了然于胸，更多地是一边学习一边进行，涉及到变量的部分无可奉告。
自身情况及案例
自身情况

笔者家中由于入网设备较多，以及需要多网合并带宽等需求，传统路由器性能已无法达到笔者需求，因此家中有一台低功耗服务器作为软路由使用，部署在 VMware 虚拟机中。

所使用网络基于中国电信，配备有公网非固定 IP 和动态域名。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日（2022/9/15）设计圈有个大新闻，Adobe 公布了收购 Figma 的消息：

Adobe 的官方公告
Figma 的官方公告
Figma CEO 的推特

Adobe 决定用 200 亿美元（一半股票，一半现金）收购 Figma，交易还需要获得监管部⻔的批准，预计将在 2023 年完成。
这对于设计界来说是一个爆炸性的新闻，虽然在此前也有征兆，早在去年（2021）Figma 的最早的两个联合创始人之一，与现任 Figma CEO 在大学时期一起创建 Figma 的前 CTO Evan Wallace 从 Figma 离职了，可能在那时就已经决定了 Figma 的命运。
对于这次收购，很多设计师对 Figma 非常的悲观，相比 Figma 而言 Adobe 更像是一个无情的资本机器，收购来的产品鲜有好下场的，上一个 Adobe 收购的界面设计工具 Macromedia Fireworks 已经死在 2013 年了。
Macromedia Fireworks 1.0
而 Adobe 的旧有产品缓慢又迟钝的更新，在设计师群体中形成了 Adobe 就是一头笨拙的大象的印象。在过去，设计师们既不满意又无法逃过 Adobe 的魔掌，Figma 的出现让设计师至少在 UI 设计领域上挣脱了 Adobe 的束缚，可惜即使 Figma 在 UI 设计领域战胜了 Adobe，又拓宽了设计与协作的领域，最终还是被 Adobe 花钱摆平了。
很多设计师对 Adobe 收购最有印象的是 2005 年收购 Macromedia，曾经风靡一时的 Macromedia 产品 Dreamweaver、Fireworks、Flash、 Authorware 几乎都死在了 Adobe 手上，其实 Adobe 的买买买从更早就开始了，Adobe 的代表产品 Photoshop 就是 1995 年收购…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spotify 可以说是少数派中无所不知的一款音乐软件，简洁克制的界面设计和无干扰的听歌体验吸引了不少听众。但是一直以来，Spotify 在 Android 上算不上有特别好的体验。尤其是一直没有修复的手势条沉浸问题，一条黑色的底边让人感到非常膈应。Spotify 似乎也没有做Light Mode 的打算，如果能有个亮色主题也会非常好看。
来源：@酱紫表
⚠️使用该 App 需要有 Spotify Premium
Introducing to New redesign Spotify: Jetispot

打开应用的第一个界面，我就已经被吸引到了。这些控件按钮都有十足的“原生”的味道
Welcome to Jetispot!
开始体验一下全新风格的 Spotify
登录后，可以看到主界面和Spotify的基本排布类似。Navigation Bar 上分为主页、搜索和资料库，右上角的三个小图标排布也相同。不过可以看到，作者还添加了两个分类标签：Music 和 Podcasts & Shows。我认为这是一个很实用的功能，毕竟谁也不想在公共场合打开后看到播客里显示一些很奇怪的东西 可惜这个App本身还未完成，这部分还不能正常使用。

随意探索一下
可以看到在搜索页面依然是大差不差。最明显的就是 Browse all 所有的卡片都用上了圆角。不过也能看到搜索栏功能还尚未实现。

现在，我们来选择一个专辑看看
可以看到在专辑页面中，背景色不再是原来的偏向于黑暗的页面。背景的渐变颜色是根据专辑封面来选取的，与 Spotify 相比感觉没有那么的压抑，整体显得很轻快明亮。

选择一首歌来听听
感觉加载速度和 Spotify 比起来没有很大的延迟，就是一个用起来不会因为加载不动而感到不舒适。不过这个音乐界面相对来说有一些简陋，上半部分很空旷。同时进度条也没有用上长得像蛇一样的波浪条👀

还可以做的更好

整体而言，我对 Android 上能有一个外观不错的 Spotify 第三方还是很满意了。
毕竟 Spotify 连个手势条沉浸都不管
Jetispot 可以说是很好看，但绝对算不上稳定优秀。
在我使用的过程中经常会偶尔遇到闪退和 Bug。而且这个软件很多功能尚未完成：搜索栏尚未支持，消息通知点无法使用，主页的筛选也无法使用，点赞的功能尚未实现，通知栏中的小图标也尚未适配。
小图标的位置只有空虚⚪
该 App 目前仍然在继续开发中。作者在 Telegram Channel 中还发布了正在制作歌词部分的预览。
以下是作者在 Github 上的规划

What's working:

sign in (login/pass only, no FB/Meta/whatsoever support, no Smart Lock either)
"browse", "home", album, premium plan, artist and genre screens (some of the blocks might be unsupported)
library: "liked songs" w/ tag&sort support, rootlist (liked playlists) + pins + artist/album support w/ nice animations, delta updates + pub/sub processing support
basic playback w/ Spotify Connect support (connect support is very WIP)
fairly optimized R8 rules, providing approx. 5-6 megabytes release APK size (with the playback and protobuf parts!)

What's in progress:

"Now Playing" improvements
better service (notification improvements)

希望可以能够长久的发展下去，RIP for Xpo Music🙏
你可以在 Github 或 Telegram Channel 免费下载使用 Jetispot。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你到了一个陌生的地方旅游，你会选择哪种方式？

方式一：去名胜古迹，或被证明过很好玩的地方打卡；
方式二：随机开车，走到哪儿就在哪儿玩。

我是属于比较保守的那类人，我会选择第一种，这样感觉更保险。但是我住在加拿大的姨娘选择的是第二种。下面这个是她的朋友圈：

随机点地图的出行方式让我心生艳羡，于是评论道「特别好」。
但我想很多人，包括我在内，都会觉得这种靠随机点地图就走的方式比较冒险，就像去到一家陌生的商场里，会先通过大众点评的评级进行一轮筛选，然后再去看对应店家下的评论，最后确定在了一家网红餐厅上。
这种由别人构建出的无形的价值系统，会让我们不自觉地去遵从，我把这种价值系统称作「体裁」。
拧巴、纠结、焦虑，都可能是因为你身处的体裁与你的内在目标产生了矛盾。我想通过这篇文章，疏通一下你的「自我拧巴」情绪。
一、体裁与规则
体裁原本指的是「一切艺术作品的种类和样式」。一个表现形式，只有在特定的场景中，才会发挥应该有的意义。
赵衡毅在《趣味符号学》里说1：

所有的符号文本，都从属于一定的体裁，体裁是一种符号发出者与接收者都接受的一个文化契约，在契约中，符号的发送者与接收者互相限制对方的自由，但是增加了效率。

比如，小说和说明书就是不同的体裁，两者都有对应的呈现形式。而对于读者而言，看小说可以不用当真，但是看说明书需要一板一眼地照着指示来改变现实。
在看一本书之前，先知道它属于什么体裁，就能提高你和作者的沟通效率。再比如谍战人员之间秘密传输的暗号，就需要严格按照对应的体裁规范，去生成信息和解析信息。
体裁如果延伸到我们的生活方式里，它就是某一个群体约定俗成的潜规则。这些规则会束缚着我们的思想和行为。群体有大有小，小到某一个兴趣社群，大到社会性别的约束。
20年前，一位陕西咸阳附近农村的家庭妇女，从小的家里教育就是要孝敬公婆、做好饭、做好衣服、照顾孩子。
她是大家眼里的好…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part 0 引入
众所周知，Watch 有两种视图。第一个是「列表视图」，第二个则是「蜂窝视图」。我第一次用蜂窝视图的时候觉得这种交互模式非常炫酷，但是用了一段时间后的感受是 —— 「就像把杂货箱的东西全部倾倒出来，然后直到找着这一次需要的东西」。这无疑是一个非常糟糕的体验，因为每一次找 App 都要反复体验一下找杂物的难受感。所以这里触发了一个痛点是：「买完 Apple Watch 之后，我们应该如何快速找到并打开目标 app 呢？」
回忆一下小时候混乱的工具箱
本篇文章的前提 —— 在抛除了「Siri」、「程序坞」、「表盘上的快捷入口」三种检索方式的基础之上，再来探索有没有办法可以进一步提高效率，让我们的「应用菜单」也可以具备更强的检索性，做到井井有条。
Grid View（网格视图，我也喜欢称为蜂窝视图）
Part 1 思路总括
一开始我是换回了习惯的「列表视图」，依靠皇冠的转动来找到 App。但是列表视图有个问题是 —— 你无法调整 App 的显示顺序。就算你可以调整并分类 App，你也有可能需要在「单向」上线性地浏览众多的 App 之后才能找到目标，
List View（列表视图）
所以思路开始清晰起来 —— 如果我们把应用进行分类，并从中心延伸到几个不同的方向，就可以减少查找的时间和查找的路径长度。基于此，我们利用蜂窝的特性，从中心恰好可以切割出 6 条大方向，代表 6 个大类，然后把最主要的 App 直接放到 6 条线上。相当于至少提高检索速度 6 倍。
自制演示图
Part 2 和我一起来分类
现在，请大家停下 1 分钟，和我一起思考：我的 Apple Watch 上大致都有哪些 app 呢？对于我而言，我会分为以下 6 大类（逆时针），然后把最常用的放到线上：

健康
运动
音乐·声音
办公·社交·信息
支付
其他工具

近期，微信因推出输入法再次冲上热搜，由于越使用占用空间越大，又一次激起了人们对微信「小而美」的调侃。
为什么微信越来越臃肿了？在过去十一年来，微信是如何一步一步成为一个超级 APP 的？为了了解背后的发展故事，我作了此文加以梳理。研究中国最大的社交软件的发展史，其实也是研究过去十几年来简中移动互联网的变迁过程。也是试图解答一个徘徊许久的疑问：这些在摇滚精神和改革开放理念下成长的一代人，简中世界互联网的掌门人，作为新中国历史以来最成功的阶级上升案例，又是如何一步一步，从勇者变成恶龙的。
本文亦有视频版本。
老大哥在看着你
在 1984 的开篇有这么一句话：无论你走往哪个方向，总有一双眼睛跟着你。Big Brother is watching you.

如今，无论身处何时何地，只要打开手机，也有一双眼睛在看着你。
船票：新大陆与旧秩序
今年是世界末日后的第十年。在今天，很多人可能并不了解或已经遗忘了 2012 的含义。但在十年前，桌面互联网发展的高峰之时，新兴媒体里关于世界末日的讨论贯穿了 2012 年始末。2012 贴吧也是那一年里最热门的百度贴吧之一。有人发帖说自己变卖了全部家产，准备在末日到来前玩个痛快。
风靡一时的 2012 贴吧
待到末日论调随新年钟响而息鼓偃旗，人们发现生活还要继续；曾以为世界将有很大的变化，然而现实来临时却总是似是而非，但未来的确将有所不同。
2011 年，采用三明治架构的、被视作时代经典的 iPhone 4 进入中国市场；同年，iPhone 4S 在乔布斯逝世前一天发布，被喻为乔布斯的遗作，引起了热烈的抢购和黄牛加价。「割肾换爱疯」的梗也从那时流传开来。十月份，《乔布斯传》中文版上市，成为当年排行第一的畅销书，销量甚至力压了当时常年霸占销冠、各有新书的韩寒和郭敬明。在一篇《萌芽》杂志对韩寒的…]]></summary>
