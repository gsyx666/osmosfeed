It can work concurrently with the program and uses a writer barrier. This means that when a Go program runs, the Go scheduler is responsible for the scheduling of the application and the garbage collector. This is as if the Go scheduler has to deal with a regular application with multiple goroutines!\nThe core idea behind this algorithm came from Edsger W. Dijkstra, Leslie Lamport, A. J. Martin, C. S.

Learn following things in ES6 like : map method , filter method , template strings , var , let , const , hoisting , arrow functions , this keyword , class in js , OOP in js , destructuring etc.\n— Learn react docs more than anything in world then you feel react js is so easy that a common man learn do it within months.\nNow, create more projects like todolist, ecommerce website, api covid tracker and many crud projects to be used in react.",

Due to deadlines, quick decisions had to be made, therefore, there is room for improvement.\nUltimately, I decided to refactor the codebase, get rid of the duplicates and make it more readable in a different branch called, refactoring. Meanwhile, I didn't forget about unit tests. Currently palpatine doesn't have any, but later in a couple of weeks I will be adding them as required. Refactoring the code and making sure you are satisfied with how it looks, plays a big role in the process of writing t…",

This week was all about cleaning up my code. I refactored my code by reducing code duplication, extracting functions, removing global variables, and giving better names to my variables. Previously, I had already worked on splitting my code up into multiple files. To do the refactoring of my code, I first created a branch called refactoring and made all my changes on this branch…",

It looks up the cached ssh keys and tries them one by one from top to bottom.\nIf the key is not cached it will look into the .ssh directory. That's why it will work even if you delete the key pair from there.

          "description": "VirtualBox 7.0 是自其上次大版本更新以来的一次重大升级。有一些不错的进步！\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n对 VirtualBox 来说，这是一次大的升级。这个版本值得关注，因为我们在最近几年没有看到过它的大版本更新。\n\r\n对于那些不熟悉 VirtualBox 的人来说，它是一个由 甲骨文公司 开发的虚拟化软件。\n\r\n随着 VirtualBox 7.0 的推出，增加了许多新功能。\n\r\n让我们来看看其中最关键的一些。\n\r\nVirtualBox 7.0 的新内容\n\r\n\n\r\nVirtualBox 7.0 是一次有益的升级。有图标更新、主题改进，以及一些关键的亮点，包括：\n\r\n\r\n一个显示运行中的客体Guest的性能统计的新工具。\n\r\n支持安全启动。\n\r\n支持全加密虚拟机Full VM Encryption（通过 CLI）。\n\r\n重新设计的新建虚拟机向导。\n\r\n\r\n通过命令行管理的全加密虚拟机\n\r\n虚拟机（VM）现在可以完全加密了，但只能通过命令行界面。\n\r\n这也包括加密的配置日志和暂存状态。\n\r\n截至目前，用户只能通过命令行界面对机器进行加密，未来将增加不同的方式。\n\r\n新的资源监控工具\n\r\n\n\r\n新的实用程序可以让你监控性能统计，如 CPU、内存使用、磁盘 I/O 等。它将列出所有正在运行的客体的性能统计。\n\r\n这不是最吸引人的补充，但很有用。\n\r\n改进的主题支持\n\r\n对主题的支持在所有平台上都得到了改进。在 Linux 和 macOS 上使用原生引擎，而在 Windows 上，有一个单独的实现。\n\r\n对安全启动的支持\n\r\nVirtualBox 现在支持安全启动，增强了对恶意软件、病毒和间谍软件的安全性。\n\r\n它还将防止虚拟机使用损坏的驱动程序启动，这对企业应用非常重要。\n\r\n使用那些需要安全启动才能运行的操作系统的用户现在应该能够轻松创建虚拟机了。\n\r\n其他变化\n\r\nVirtualBox 7.0 是一次重大的升级。因此，有几个功能的增加和全面的完善。\n\r\n例如，新件虚拟机向导现在已经重新设计，以整合无人值守的客体操作系统安装。\n\r\n\n\r\n其他改进包括：\n\r\n\r\n云端虚拟机现在可以被添加到 VirtualBox，并作为本地虚拟机进行控制。\n\r\nVirtualBox 的图标在此版本中得到了更新。\n\r\n引入了一个新的 3D 栈，支持 DirectX 11。它使用 DXVK 来为非 Windows 主机提供同样的支持。\n\r\n支持虚拟 TPM 1.2/2.0。\n\r\n改进了多显示器设置中的鼠标处理。\n\r\nVorbis 是音频录制的默认音频编解码器。\n\r\n\r\n你可以查看 发行说明 以了解更多信息。\n\r\n如果你正在寻找增强的功能，如更好的主题支持、加密功能、安全启动支持和类似的功能添加，VirtualBox 7.0 是一个不错的升级。\n\r\n💬 你对这次升级有什么看法？你会使用较新的版本还是暂时坚持使用旧版本的虚拟机？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/virtualbox-7-0-release/\n\r\n作者：Sourav Rudra 选题：lkxed 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "微软发布免费的 AI 图像合成软件\n\r\n微软宣布了基于 OpenAI 的 DALL-E 2 模型的应用 Designer。用户可通过输入文字提示生成一系列图像。Designer 有免费版和付费版，将提供给微软 365 个人和家庭订阅用户。目前 Designer 作为一个免费的 Web 应用供公众测试和获取反馈，类似的技术将整合到 Edge 浏览器和 Bing 搜索引擎中。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：ARS Technica\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：AI 图像生成已经势不可挡，虽然目前还有一些道德瑕疵，但是这总是能解决的。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nGNU 工具链考虑将其基础设施转移到 Linux 基金会\n\r\nGNU 工具链是 GNU/Linux 生态系统、云和嵌入式环境的基石。红帽公司资助的 SourceWare.org 多年来一直在托管 GNU 工具链的大部分基础设施，但最近有提议将其基础设施转移到 Linux 基金会提供的 IT 服务下。Linux 基金会的 IT 服务将管理 Git 存储库、邮件列表、错误跟踪器、网站、CI/CD 以及相关的基础设施。GNU 工具链的领导层已经正式表态支持这一提议。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这件事 Linux 基金会做的不错，毕竟有专门的组织来负责维护，总比红帽员工兼职维护更可靠些。毕竟，现在这种基础软件的安全一旦动摇，影响的范围已经不仅仅是个人爱好者了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nDebian GNU/Linux 14 代号已确定为“Forky”\n\r\nDebian 方面今天宣布，计划 2027 年发布的 Debian 14 将被称为 “Forky”。Debian 的代号是以《玩具总动员》系列中的玩具命名的。即将在 2023 年发布的 Debian 12 代号为“Bookworm”，而 2025 年发布的 Debian 13 的代号是 “Trixie”。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：不知道《玩具总动员》中有多少个的有名字的玩具，要是用完了怎么办。",

          "description": "如果你在搜索引擎中输入“ARPANET”，搜索相关图片，你会看到许多地图的图片，上面是这个上世纪六十年代末七十年代初 美国政府创建的研究网络，该网络不断延伸扩展，横跨了整个美国。我猜很多人第一次了解到 ARPANET 的时候都看过这种地图。\n\r\n可以说，这些地图很有意思，毕竟我们很难想象过去连接网络的计算机是那么少，就连如此低保真的图片都可以表示出美国全部机器的所在位置（这里的低保真lo-fi指的是高射投影仪成像技术，而不是大家熟知的 lo-fi 氛围音乐）。不过，这些地图是有问题的。地图上用加粗的线条连接着大陆各地，强化了人们的一种观念：ARPANET 最大的贡献就是首次将横跨美国东西两地的电脑连接了起来。\n\r\n今天，即便是在病毒肆虐、人们困居家中的情况下，网络也能把我们联系起来，可谓是我们的生命线。所以，如果认为 ARPANET 是最早的互联网，那么在那之前世界必然相互隔绝，毕竟那时还没有今天的互联网，对吧？ARPANET 首次通过计算机将人们连接起来，一定是一件惊天动地的大事。\n\r\n但是，这一观点却与历史事实不符，而且它也没有进一步解释 ARPANET 的重要性。\n\r\n初露锋芒\n\r\n华盛顿希尔顿酒店坐落于国家广场National Mall东北方向约 2.4 千米处的一座小山丘山顶附近。酒店左右两侧白色的现代化立面分别向外延展出半个圆形，活像一只飞鸟的双翼。1965 年，酒店竣工之后，《纽约时报》报道称这座建筑物就像“一只栖息在山顶巢穴上的海鸥” [1]。\n\r\n不过，这家酒店最有名的特点却深藏在地下。在车道交汇处下方，有着一个巨大的蛋形活动场地，这就是人们熟知的国际宴会厅International Ballroom，多年来一直是华盛顿特区最大的无柱宴会厅。1967 年，大门乐队在此举办了一场音乐会。1968 年，“吉他之神”吉米·亨德里克斯也在此举办了一场音乐会。到了 …",

          "description": "Firefox OS 复活\n\r\nFirefox OS 是 Mozilla 在 2013 年创建的安卓替代品，并于 2016 年放弃了它。2018 年，在 Firefox OS 基础上曾出现了一个令人失望的 KaiOS，主要针对功能机市场的商业操作系统，但它是封闭的，还会跟踪用户并且有广告。现在，Capyloon 项目决定复活 Firefox OS，将其带到现代 Linux 智能手机上。该项目还处于早期阶段。它能运行旧的 Firefox OS 应用。目前可以在安卓设备上通过启动谷歌通用系统镜像（GSI）测试其 UI。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Tux Phones\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：本来可能成为 Mozilla 的一个基石型项目，非常可惜被放弃了，我认为放弃 Firefox OS 是 Mozilla 的一大败笔。不过，新的复活计划是否能真正复活 Firefox OS，还需要拭目以待，毕竟，时代不同了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n国产编译器项目 LambdaChip 捐赠给 HardenedLinux\n\r\n开放硬件整体方案 LambdaChip 是为数不多的国产编译器项目，其背后的公司正式破产清算，将其项目改名为 Animula，并正式捐赠给 HardenedLinux 社区。LambdaChip 是一个野心勃勃的国产项目，试图在 10KB 内存的单片机上同时支持 Scheme、Lua 5.2 和 Python3 等语言，已经有了一些不错的进展。HardenedLinux 自嘲其“是否成为商业失败的开源项目的集散地的结论为时尚早”，并对此类项目表示了欢迎。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Solidot\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看来 HardenedLinux 成为了一个孤儿项目摇篮。不过，确实需要一些组织来负责照料这些因为种种原因被放弃的项目。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nLinux 内核 6.1 放弃火线串口驱动，删除了 4000 行代码\n\r\nLinux 的 fwserial 驱动程序允许通过 IEEE-1394（火线接口）连接 TTY，以实现对等体之间的有线高速串行连接。但自从该驱动程序在 2012 年被合并以来，没有人负责维护该驱动程序。而且，现在有更好的连接方式，苹果的火线接口越来越没有人使用了。因此，它在 Linux 内核 6.1 中被删除，为内核减少了约 4000 行代码。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：作为一个发展了 30 年的软件项目，其中肯定充斥着大量过时或无用的驱动和代码，因此时不时清理一下也是好的。不过，我觉得或许应该有更明确的规则对内核的各个组成部分设置不同的生命周期。",

          "description": "Brave 是一款出色的类似于 Chrome，但可 替代 Chrome 的网络浏览器。\n\r\n\r\nFirefox 和 Brave 是我喜欢在 Linux 系统上使用的两种浏览器。两者都有不同的优势。\n\r\nFirefox 比 Brave 做得更好的一件事就是画中画（PIP）模式，它适用于 YouTube、Netflix 和大多数流媒体网站。\n\r\nBrave 也有画中画模式，但它是如此隐藏，以至于你觉得它根本没有 PIP 支持。\n\r\n内置画中画适用于某些网站（如 YouTube），但可能不适用于其他网站（如 Prime Video）。不用担心！你可以为此使用专用扩展。\n\r\n让我在本教程中展示这两种方法。\n\r\n方法 1：在视频上双击右键\n\r\n技巧是依次单击两次右键，你应该会看到画中画模式选项。\n\r\n让我通过一个例子来说明这一点。在 Brave 中播放 YouTube 视频。现在右键单击视频。\n\r\n\n\r\n再次右键单击。它应该在视频上，但不在上一个上下文菜单上，而在视频的其他地方。\n\r\n现在你应该看到另一个带有画中画选项的上下文菜单。\n\r\n\n\r\n选择画中画，视频将从窗口中弹出。你可以将其移动到浏览器中的任何位置。\n\r\n\n\r\n当你使用其他应用时，你还可以让它在屏幕上的任何位置播放。\n\r\n\n\r\n在最近的 Brave 版本中，你可以根据自己的喜好调整弹出窗口的大小。\n\r\n我不明白为什么 Brave 把它隐藏成这样。为什么不突出它？\n\r\n无论如何，这适用于 YouTube 等网站，但可能不适用于 Prime 视频。如果你愿意，你可以安装一个扩展。\n\r\n方法 2：使用画中画扩展\n\r\n谷歌提供了一个官方插件，可让你在谷歌 Chrome 中获得画中画功能。由于 Brave 基于 Chromium，你可以在 Brave 中使用相同的扩展。\n\r\n\r\n画中画扩展\n\r\n\r\n进入扩展页面并点击 “添加到 BraveAdd to Brave” 按钮。\n\r\n\n\r\n当你单击它时，它会提示添加扩展的选项。\n\r\n\n\r\n添加扩展后，你应该会在浏览器的右上角看到它。\n\r\n\n\r\n播放视频时，单击该扩展图标，视频应该会弹出。\n\r\n你能在 Brave 中启用 PIP 模式吗？\n\r\n画中画模式已成为休闲流媒体消费的必备功能。我觉得奇怪的是，Brave 和其他浏览器没有足够重视它。 Firefox 处理得很好。\n\r\n我希望这个快速的小技巧可以帮助你在 Brave 浏览器中获得 PIP 体验。你更喜欢这两种方法中的哪一种？右键单击还是扩展？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/picture-in-picture-brave/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

We ended in text message chaos, missed the messages or simply forgot about them. In the end we had 3 hair dryers but no extra gas for the gas stove. \nSometimes we bought things and at the trip a friend notes: “Oh, I would have that at home.”.\n\nHow we solve the problem\nWith a super simple app which is easy to share, simple to access and doesn’t need a new native app on the smartphone. We called our little problem solver whobrings.com\n\nFeatures\n- Simply share the list URL with your group\n- Together add items to a list\n- Assign yourself if you can bring an item\n- Set the amount and description of an item\n- Split the people who bring an item if the amount is bigger than 1\n- Start a survey if others think the item is needed\n- Live updates and list changes\n\nCommon use cases\nGroups organize their next adventure or mostly camping holidays.\nTeachers and parents organize school meetings.\nFamilies organize family gatherings and events.\nSmall business teams organize meetings.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
