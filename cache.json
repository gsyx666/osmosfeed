          "description": "这个带有脚本的快速指南有助于清理旧的 Snap 软件包，并释放 Ubuntu 系统中的一些磁盘空间。\n\r\n\r\n我的 Ubuntu 测试系统中出现磁盘空间不足。因此，我通过 GNOME 的磁盘使用分析器进行调查，以找出哪个软件包正在消耗宝贵的 SSD 空间。除了通常的缓存和主目录，令我惊讶的是，我发现 Snap 和 Flatpak 消耗了大量的存储空间。\n\r\n\n\r\n我始终坚持一个规则：除非必要，否则不要使用 Snap 或 Flatpak。这主要是因为它们的安装大小和一些其他问题。我更喜欢原生 deb 和 rpm 包。多年来，我在这个测试系统中安装和移除了一些 Snap 包。\n\r\n问题出现在卸载后。Snap 在系统中保留了一些残留文件，而一般用户不知道。\n\r\n所以我打开了 Snap 文件夹 /var/lib/snapd/snaps，发现 Snap 会保留以前安装/卸载的软件包的旧版本。\n\r\n例如，在下图中，你可以看到 GNOME 3.28、3.34 和 Wine 这些都被删除了。但它们还在那里。这是因为 Snap 设计上在正确卸载后保留已卸载软件包的版本。\n\r\n\n\r\n或者，你可以在终端中使用：\n\r\nsnap list --all\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n对于保留的版本数量，默认值为 3。这意味着 Snap 会保留每个软件包的 3 个旧版本，包括当前安装版本。如果你对磁盘空间没有限制，这是可以的。\n\r\n但是对于服务器和其他场景，这很容易遇到成本问题，消耗你的磁盘空间。\n\r\n不过，你可以使用以下命令轻松修改计数。该值可以在 2 到 20 之间。\n\r\nsudo snap set system refresh.retain=2\r\n\n\r\n清理 Snap 版本\n\r\n在 SuperUser 的一篇文章中，Canonical 的前工程经理 Popey 提供了一个简单的脚本 可以清理旧的 Snap 版本并保留最新版本。\n\r\n这是我们将用来清理 Snap 的脚本。\n\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n #Removes old revisions of snaps\r\n #CLOSE ALL SNAPS BEFORE RUNNING THIS\r\n set -eu\r\n LANG=en_US.UTF-8 snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $3}' |\r\n     while read snapname revision; do\r\n         snap remove \"$snapname\" --revision=\"$revision\"\r\n     done\r\n\n\r\n将上述脚本以 .sh 格式保存在目录中（例如 clean_snap.sh），赋予其可执行权限并运行。\n\r\nchmod +x clean_snap.sh\r\n\n\r\n当我运行脚本时，它减少了很多磁盘空间。该脚本还将显示要删除的包的名称。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n结束语\n\r\n关于 Snap 的设计效率如何，人们总是争论不休。许多人说，它的设计是糟糕的，是臃肿的，且消耗系统资源。该论点的某些部分是正确的，我不会否认。如果正确实施和增强，沙盒应用的整个概念就很棒。我相信，与 Snap 相比，Flatpak 做得更好。\n\r\n也就是说，我希望这可以帮助你清理一些磁盘空间。尽管它只在 Ubuntu 中进行了测试，但它应该适用于所有支持 Snap 的 Linux 发行版。\n\r\n此外，请查看我们关于 如何清理 Ubuntu 的指南以及其他步骤。\n\r\n最后，如果你正在寻找清理 Flatpak 应用，请参阅 这个指南。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/clean-up-snap/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：校对者ID\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "中国内核开发者向 Linus 建议继续保留 5.20 版本号\n\r\n前两天，在 Linux 内核 5.19 的发布公告中，Linus Torvalds 称，由于比较大的数会让他混淆，按照惯例，他准备将 5.20 版本“20 进位”到 6.0。今天，一位中国的 Linux 内核开发者 Zhang Boyang，在内核邮件列表中向 Linus 表示，“5.20” 在中文代表“我爱你”。因此，“Linux 5.20” 在中文中可以被理解为 “我爱 Linux”。因此，他建议 Linus 继续使用 5.20 版本号，以鼓励对 Linux 的热爱。之前，Linux 在发布 3.11 版时，曾将该版本专门命名为 “Linux For Workgroups”，以纪念微软的操作系统里程碑 Windows for Workgroups 3.11。不过，目前 Linus 和其它人尚未对此进行回应。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：内核邮件列表\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我觉得这个建议不错，不知道 Linus 会怎么想？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nGitLab 禁止员工使用 Windows\n\r\nGitLab 的文件显示，它允许员工使用 Linux 和 macOS，而禁止使用 Windows。理由是：Windows 是份额最高的桌面系统，因此也是间谍软件、病毒和勒索软件的最主要目标。Windows 家庭版的安全性难以保障，因此不符合该公司的安全准则。苹果的电脑是首选，如果熟悉 Linux 也可选择戴尔公司的 Linux 笔记本电脑。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：GitLab\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：有道理的规定，作为一个技术公司，这样要求不过分。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n开发者大幅精简 Rust for Linux v9 补丁\n\r\n本周早些时候，开发者发布了 Rust for Linux v8 补丁，这些补丁带来了多达 43.6 万行新代码，而今天发布的 Rust for Linux v9 大幅瘦身，删除了许多额外的功能和集成，只有 12.5 万行的新代码。开发者称，“这是一个精简过的 v8。它有足够的支持来编译一个最小的 Rust 内核模块，目的是先获得‘核心’支持，然后开始向上游逐个扩展其他部分。”Linus Torvalds 一直希望尽快完成该补丁的合并。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看来，在下一个 Linux 内核中我们有望见到 Rust 的正式支持了。",

          "description": "有几个可供桌面 Linux 用户使用的 电子书阅读器。\n\r\n几乎所有发行版都带有可以打开 PDF 文件的文档阅读器。它还可能支持其他文件格式，例如 epub 或 Mobi，但不一定。\n\r\n这就是为什么需要像 Foliate 和 Calibre 这样的专门应用来阅读和管理各种格式的电子书的原因。\n\r\n最近，我遇到了另一个开源软件，它为电子书阅读器提供了几个令人兴奋的功能。\n\r\nKoodo：它有你能想到的一切\n\r\nKoodo 是一款多合一的开源电子书阅读器，具有帮助你更好地管理和阅读电子书的功能。它是一个跨平台应用，你可以在 Linux、Windows 和 macOS 上下载。你甚至可以 在浏览器中使用它。\n\r\n它的用户界面看起来很现代，可能是因为它是一个 Electron 应用。你必须导入书籍并将它们添加到 Koodo。它不按文件夹导入书籍。不过，你可以选择多个文件进行导入。书太多了？可以将一些添加到你的收藏夹以便快速访问。\n\r\n\n\r\n我使用了 AppImage 格式的软件包，但由于未知原因，它没有显示文件的缩略图。\n\r\n\n\r\n它支持流行的电子书文件格式，如 PDF、Mobi 和 Epub。但不止这些，它还支持 CBR、CBZ 和 CBT 等漫画书格式，它还支持更多。它还可以阅读 FictionBooks（.fb2）、Markdown 和富文本格式（RTF）以及微软 Office Word 文档（.docx）。\n\r\n除了支持很多文件格式外，它还提供了多种功能来改善你的阅读体验。\n\r\n你可以高亮显示文本并使用文本注释对其进行注释。你还可以在当前文档或谷歌上搜索选定的文本。\n\r\n\n\r\n你可以从主应用窗口的侧边栏中访问高亮显示的文本和注释。\n\r\n也有文本到语音和翻译选定文本的选项。但是，这两个功能在我的测试中都不起作用。我使用的是 Koodo 的 AppImage 版本。\n\r\nKoodo 支持各种布局。你可以以单列、双列或连续滚动布局阅读文档。对于 ePub 和 Mobi 格式，它会自动以双列布局打开。对于 PDF，默认选择单列布局。\n\r\n你可以根据自己的喜好自定义 UI。更改字体、大小、段落间距、文本颜色、背景颜色、行间距、亮度等。\n\r\n\n\r\nKoodo 支持夜间阅读模式以及五个不同的主题。你可以根据自己的喜好在主题之间切换。\n\r\n你还可以使用 Dropbox 或其他支持 Webdav 协议的 云服务 跨设备同步你的书籍和阅读数据（如高亮、笔记等）。\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Linux 上获取 Koodo\n\r\n如果你想体验一下 Koodo，你可以试试它的在线版本。你可以在浏览器中使用 Koodo。你的数据本地存储在浏览器中，如果你清理浏览器缓存，你会丢失数据（高亮、笔记等，但不会丢失计算机上存储的书籍）。\n\r\n\r\n在线尝试 Koodo\n\r\n\r\n如果你喜欢它的功能，可以选择在您的计算机上安装 Koodo。\n\r\nLinux 用户有多种选择。你有 Debian 和基于 Ubuntu 的发行版的 deb 文件、Red Hat 和 Fedora 的 RPM，以及面向所有发行版的 Snap、AppImage 和可执行文件。\n\r\n你可以从项目主页获取你选择的安装程序。\n\r\n\r\n下载 Koodo\n\r\n\r\n总结\n\r\nKoodo 并不完美。它有大量功能，但并非所有功能都能完美运行，正如我在测试中发现的那样。\n\r\n尽管如此，它仍然是一个很好的应用，有可能在用户中流行起来。只有少数几个应用包含如此多的功能。\n\r\n感谢 Koodo 开发人员为桌面用户创建了一个有前途的开源应用。\n\r\n你可以 访问该项目的仓库 来查看源代码、报告 bug 或者通过给项目加星来向开发者表达喜爱。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/koodo-ebook-reader/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "龙芯指 RISC-V 不能实现自主，坚持自研指令集\n\r\n龙芯之前基于 MIPS 指令，去年开始推自研的 “龙芯架构” 指令集，号称 100% 自主。龙芯公司日前称，公司创立之初就认识到基于 x86 或者 ARM 不能建立自主体系，而 MIPS 指令系统相对比较开放。但 2019 年 MIPS 开源后又闭源的事件，公司认识到基于 MIPS 也无法建立自主生态。而对于最近几年很受欢迎的 RISC-V 开源指令集，龙芯认为基于 RISC-V 同样不能构建自主生态体系，RISC-V 架构指令条数较少，比较适合学术研究以及物联网应用，商业应用会需要增加更多的指令，因此龙芯坚持自主研发指令集。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：快科技\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我坚持认为 RISC-V 开源指令集才是未来。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n单核计算机一小时破解了一种抗量子加密算法\n\r\n美国国家标准技术局（NIST）最近宣布了后量子加密和签名算法竞赛的首批获胜者。一种名为 SIKE 抗量子加密候选算法曾进入了第四轮评选，它是一种基于 Isogeny 的算法。鲁汶大学的一个团队发表论文称，他们在一台单核计算机上耗时一个小时获取了 SIKE 使用的加密密钥。SIKE 算法的发明人承认这出乎意料。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：ARS Technica\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：在量子计算还没有真正实用之前就妄想创造抗量子计算的算法，我觉得有些有些想的简单了。谁能肯定量子计算机就只能做到我们目前以为的那些事情呢，就像计算机刚刚发明之初，谁能想到如今整个世界都跑在计算机之上呢。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nFedora 37 正式支持树莓派 4\n\r\nFedora 工程和指导委员会已经确认了对树莓派 4 的“官方”支持。之前，树莓派 4 没有成为 Fedora 工作站的重点，是因为各种补丁没有被上游化，比如开源 3D 图形驱动没有上游化到内核中。现在，虽然这些上游化的工作还在进行中，但 Fedora 37 将可以提供对树莓派 4B 以及树莓派 400 和 CM4 计算模块的支持。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：之前 Pop!_OS 22.04 已经为树莓派 4 提供了支持，而 Fedora 37 也紧随其后，这都是这些驱动进入了上游后的成果，所以，真正推动 Linux 发展的的引擎，还是 Linux 内核啊。",

          "description": "自《PasteNow for iOS 正式发布》后，已有三个月没有介绍 PasteNow 了。这三个月，PasteNow 也没有停止进化的脚步，分别迭代了 2.1、2.2 和 2.3 这几个版本，其中 2.3 于今天刚刚发布。本篇即是汇总一下过去三个月 PasteNow 的发展与变化。\n支持 Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴\n正如标题所说，2.3 版本带来了「Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴」的功能。这是 PasteNow 迄今为止非常重要的一个改进，不仅带来更加一致的体验，同时也大大提升效率。解决这个问题其实有点周折，我先简单地补充一下背景：\n\nWord 和 Pages，因为其固有机制的原因（也许是 Bug），它不支持剪贴板的多项目粘贴。也就说是，往剪贴板里写入多项内容，再在 Word 里操作粘贴，你会发现只有第一个内容粘贴了进去，但是如果同样在备忘录（或其他 App）里操作粘贴，是会出现多个内容的。\n\nPasteNow 的用户最早在去年7月就给我汇报了这个问题，当时我发现是 Word 和 Pages 的固有机制导致的问题后，决定暂时观察一段时间，因为也许 Word 在更新后会「修复」这个问题。\n但是等了很久，这个行为始终没有发生变化，看来确实是固有机制的限制了。正好最近又有用户汇报了相关问题，我换了一下思路，看看能不能从 PasteNow 这边做点什么的方式来解决这个问题。于是还真让我找到了一个办法。\n假如你是 Word、Pages 等的重度用户，经常需要粘贴内容至 Word、Pages 里，特别是一次性粘贴多项内容，现在通过 PasteNow 可以更好的做到这些了。请看视频！\n \n更加全面和完善的快捷键体验\n作为一个效率工具，能100%通过快捷键来达成各种操作一直是 PasteNow 重点优化的方向。在过去几个版本中，PasteNow 加强了以下两方面的快捷键体验：\n\n支持将 F1～F12 录制成快捷键了，这意味着可以用更加轻松的「单键」来达成 PasteNow 的各项操作；\n支持通过按下“@、%、$”等特殊符号也进入快速搜索模式；\n「添加标题」和「编辑文本」操作，也有了专属快捷键，分别是：Command + T 和 Command + E。\n\n相信通过以上快捷键的改进，使用 PasteNow 的过程将更加流畅。\niOS 版本的变化\n三个月前的主要事件是 iOS 版本的发布，过去三个月，iOS 版本发展的怎么样呢？这里不得不承认一个事实，这个版本并没有达到各种预期，无论是我作为开发者的预期，还是用户对它的预期。\n首先是我作为开发者的预期，目前 iOS 版本的用户非常少，日活跃用户最多时仅为 macOS 版本的 1/15。相当于 15 个 macOS 版本用户才对应 1 个 iOS 版本。这其实也是在我的预期中，但没想到会差这么多。\n另一方面是作为用户的预期，很多用户对这款 iOS 产品寄予了厚望，以为也可以像 macOS 版本一样做到后台记录剪贴板内容、实时同步剪贴板数据。但事实是这个从 iOS 的机制上就做不到，并且在即将发布的 iOS 16 里，对剪贴板的操作将会进一步变得更难。\n以上当然不是用户预期的问题，而是我在打造这款产品时没有准确的传达信息导致的，后续在 iOS 版本中，我将增加一个 FAQ 模块，让用户可以非常直观地了解到这个工具能做什么，不能做什么等等。\n当然，我依然会尽力去完善 iOS 版本的体验，使其与 macOS 的基本功能靠近，比如在 2.3 版本当中，图片类的数据，现在也可以通过长按保存至相册了。这个是会比较实用且基础的一个操作。\n小结\nPasteNow 从 1.0 发布到今天，不过一年又三个多月，它依然是一款年轻的产品，我会继续按照既定节奏去稳步迭代，不断完善它的体验与其他 App 的互操作能力。\n希望它继续给大家带来愉悦的效率之旅～\n附：少数派下载与购买链接。\n \n \n演示：PasteNow 2.3 多项目粘贴至 Word",

          "description": "为什么需要通信\n由于不同的进程运行在各自不同的内存空间中．一方对于变量的修改另一方是无法感知的．因此．进程之间的信息传递不可能通过变量或其它数据结构直接进行，只能通过进程间通信来完成。\n并发进程之间的相互通信是实现多进程间协作和同步的常用工具．具有很强的实用性，进程通信是操作系统内核层极为重要的部分。\n几种常见的进程间通信\n\n管道\n管道，一听名字，我们联想到一个管子连通的两端，既然是个管子，就可以从一头输入，从另一头输出，形成一次通信，在shell命令行中，我们经常遇到这样的写法：\nadb logcat -v time | grep \"tag\" > log.txt\n\n熟悉么？‘|’ 符号其实就类似一个管道一样，将前一个命令的输出，通过管道输入到后一命令的输入，完成一次通信，作为一个标准的程序员，探究问题，要看其本质，这样才能将知识融会贯通，UNIX的设计原则是一切皆文件，那我们猜测，管道的本质也是一个文件，前面的进程以写方式打开文件，后面的进程以读方式打开。这样前面写完后面读，于是就实现了通信。而在Linux中，管道被文件系统所管理，文件系统是操作系统中负责管理持久数据的子系统，是在磁盘之上的，为什么你的电脑可以动态扩充磁盘，其实主要归功于文件系统，通过它，我们可以无限扩充，文件系统的好处是即使计算机断电了，磁盘里的数据并不会丢失，可以持久化的保存文件。\n再说回管道，管道一种分为两种\n匿名管道\n命名管道\n匿名管道 Pipes\n所谓匿名就是没名，用完就没了，上面的‘|’，就是一个匿名管道。它的特点是只能在父子进程中应用，父进程在产生子进程前必须打开一个管道文件，然后fork产生子进程，这样子进程通过拷贝父进程的进程地址空间获得同一个管道文件的描述符，以达到使用同一个管道通信的目的。\n命名管道 FIFO\n通过 mkfifo 命令显式地创建。\nmkfifo hello\n\nhell…",

But the number could be vastly reduced by limits built into the Texas legal code, which caps damages on defamation punishments.\nThe jury handed back its verdict on Friday after hearing testimony about Jones’s finances — something he’s allegedly taken significant steps to obscure.
