          "description": "In React, we are familiar with the concepts of a className on components. It's the way React adds the class attribute to an element.\n<div className=\"bg-red-200\"></div>\n\nHowever, what happens if we want to make our custom components have the option to allow dynamic classNames?\nTo give you an example, let's say we have a CustomComponent that can take a className from wherever it's imported.\n<CustomComponent className='bg-red-200` />\n\nIf we ran this in React, we would get shown an error as the CustomComponent doesn't know what a className is.\nIn all honesty, I probably made it sounds like it was going to be very complicated, right?\nWell, fear not, it's not that scary, as we can pass the className as a prop!\nSo in your child component, we would structure its receiving end like this.\nexport default Child = ({ className }) => {\n  return (\n    <div className={className}>\n      <h2>I'm the child component</h2>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nAnd now, we can use this component like this.\n<Child className='bg-red' />\n\nAnd that's it. Our component will now render this classname on its main div.\nI also wanted to take a second to look at what happens if your child component always has certain classes and you want to add extra classes.\nIn that case, the props stay the same. However, we can dynamically render them like this.\n<div className={`existing-class ${className}`}>\n\nOur component will always render existing-class as a class but add whatever we set on it.\nSo if we use it like this:\n<Child className='bg-red' />\n\nOur result will be a div like this.\n<div class=\"existing-class bg-red\"></div>\n\nThank you for reading my blog.

If you are desperate for a new job while unemployed, or are working hard to get more jobs, this new job should be coming soon. However, a failed job interview doesn't have to be a total loss. In fact, you can learn a lot from a failed job interview.\n\nCheck again for any errors. If you haven't customized your resume for a specific job, consider changing it the next time you go to an interview.\n\nFind this ideal balance between humility and self -assured. If you're shy this time, you can take steps to improve your next opportunity.\n\nThink back to your answers and take the time to find better ones for next time. The questions that may have surprised you the first time won't be as shocking next time, so you can give them the thought they deserve.\n\nIf you're sure you didn't get the job, check with the person you interviewed to see if you can give them some advice next time.\n\nSit down with a trusted friend or mentor and ask them to submit sample interview questions. Ask for feedback at the end of the test interview.\n\nThat \"What are your weaknesses?\" The question isn't just for the show. Take the time to think about your real weaknesses and find an effective answer to this question that demonstrates self-awareness and adaptability.\n\nOf course, the interview did not have the hoped-for success, but you're not entirely wrong! Also, think about what you did right so you can be successful again in your next interview.\nDon't be discouraged after failing a job interview! Think of it as a learning experience. The situation is still there for you and you are now ready for the interview when it happens.\nGratitude for perusing my article till the end. I hope you realized something unique today.

There's a very big application I work on where we as a team started using NgRx to help us out for this very reason.\nI work on a team where most of the developers are hardened Java veterans and don't spend too much time on the frontend.

          "description": "谷歌和苹果的短信标准对抗再次升级\n\r\niPhone 的短信应用 iMessage 不支持现代的 RCS 标准，因此，从 iPhone 发往安卓的短信只能采用古老的 SMS 标准。RCS 是 2008 年推出的旨在取代 SMS 的短信标准，支持更丰富的功能。它和 iMessage 一样，其信息是通过互联网传递，而不是通过电信运营商。为了使 iPhone 也能支持先进的 RCS 规范，安卓不断向苹果施压，甚至专门做了一个页面，上面有一些按钮可以让用户给苹果的 Twitter 发消息敦促它。但是苹果就是一无所动。现在，就像 iPhone 发往安卓的短信一样，当安卓用户用表情符对 iPhone 发来的短信做出回应时，iPhone 用户收到的短信不是显示该表情符，而是对该表情符的文字描述，如“爱心”这样的文字。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Insider\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：说到底，是苹果觉得支持 RCS 对它没好处，而迫使用户都用它的 iPhone。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n开源网络安全监控平台 Zeek 成为 Windows 的一部分\n\r\n发布于 1998 年的 Zeek（最初名为 Bro）正在被整合到 Windows 中，成为微软 Defender 的一部分，“现在已经部署在全球超过 10 亿个端点上。”Zeek 可以将网络流量转化为紧凑和高保真的日志、文件内容和行为分析，以加快安全操作。Zeek 的创始人称，“我从未想过我开发的网络监控工具会在防御端点方面找到更广泛的应用 —— 但这是开源开发的创造性魔法的一部分”。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Corelight\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：微软对采用开源软件方面毫无心理障碍，凡是好的都会想办法拿到 Windows 里面。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n苹果宣布下周起更多广告将进入应用商店\n\r\n苹果宣布从 10 月 25 日开始，在除中国以外的所有国家，与应用程序相关的广告将开始出现在苹果应用商店的主“今日”标签和单个应用程序列表底部的“您可能也喜欢”部分。这是开发者首次能够在“今日”标签上投放广告。“您可能也喜欢”的广告是增加实际“应用税”的另一种手段，迫使开发者在自己的应用页面上购买广告，以避免其他人将客户从自己手上引导走。苹果应用商店的广告以前只限于基于关键词的搜索结果和搜索标签的“建议”部分。苹果希望在未来将其目前的广告收入增加近三倍，达到每年至少 100 亿美元。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：MacRumors\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：所以，就像 WIRED 说的那样，苹果现在是一家广告公司。",

          "description": "灵动岛是今年iPhone的热点更新。我们在早期的时候，看到了很多针对灵动岛的玩法，比如在岛的周围养宠物、用灵动岛打游戏、适配灵动岛的挖孔壁纸等。\n但是，这些玩法从系统和功能层面，并没有用到真正的“灵动岛接口”。在苹果开发者文档中，灵动岛实际上是一种“实时活动”。在某些用户需要实时关注状态变化的场景下，为用户展示信息。比如实时更新比赛数据、实时更新外卖进度、实时更新计时器、实时更新地图导航指引等等。\n如果iPhone安装了iOS 16.1系统，在iPhone 14 Pro机型上，实时活动可以在灵动岛和锁屏界面展示；而在非iPhone 14 Pro机型，则只在锁屏界面展示。\n\nOneWidget如何定位灵动岛？\n仔细阅读苹果开发者文档之后，我们发现实时活动的实现方式和小组件有非常多重叠的地方。同时，不管在锁屏界面还是“展开的”灵动岛位置，它的尺寸都很像中尺寸的桌面小组件。再者，实时活动不能够交互、也不能有动画、不能随时刷新，这些和小组件都太像了。所以，我们最终把实时活动定位成“一种特殊的小组件”。\n当我们把“灵动岛”定义为“实时展示的小组件”，那么一切就更简单了，原则上小组件能够实现的它都可以实现。只是我们需要额外思考，在锁屏和灵动岛这两个特殊的位置，用户凭什么要展开来用它。\nOneWidget怎么做灵动岛功能？\n在迭代产品的2年多时间里，OneWidget的各种类型的小组件从用户那里得到了很多不错的回馈。当我们复盘这些小组件，用户最关心的是三个关键词：实用、美观、趣味。所以，设计灵动岛这个特殊的小组件，我们应该做的也是实用、美观、趣味。另外补充一点，对于很多用户来说，美观、趣味也是一种实用价值，美观带来个性化的装饰、趣味带来功能的尝鲜探索。\n从实用和便捷角度，我们设计了“启动之岛”和“健康之岛”。\n从美观和趣味角度，我们设计了“宠物之岛”和“摆烂之岛”。\n\n如何开启灵动岛？\n如果iPhone更新到iOS 16.1以上，下载OneWidget 的3.6.0以上的版本之后，可以进入个人中心找到主入口。在灵动岛配置页面，选择需要开启的“岛屿”，当App进入后台或者切换到其他App，实时活动就已经开启在了锁屏界面和灵动岛区域。\n配置入口我们还单独设计了一些细节：会动的海平面、开启后的彩色提示框、预览效果等。\n\n宠物之岛\n用户可以在“宠物之岛”领养一个自己的电子宠物，它每天陪你玩、会饿、会困、会渴，在不同的状态下用户需要点击不同的操作。我们给宠物取了一个名字叫做“岛岛”，领养之后，在App内还会显示领养的天数。岛岛除了不同的状态，也有可能会出去玩耍，只有等他回来才能再次跟他互动。为了满足个性化，宠物“岛岛”还允许自定义颜色，现在我们支持了7种颜色的切换。\n\n启动之岛\n“启动之岛”可以允许用户添加快速启动App或者小程序的入口，常驻在锁屏界面和灵动岛里，展开之后即可点击一键直达的App。用户可以添加1~6的常用启动入口，根据添加的数量变化，图标和间距会自动调整来适应合适的布局。和锁屏小组件、桌面小组件一行，这里的启动器入口支持添加常用的App、微信支付宝的二级路径、微信和支付宝的小程序入口。\n\n摆烂之岛\n“摆烂之岛”将随机展示一些“反鸡汤”的插画和文案。这个功能为了满足“趣味性”，该卷的时候卷，该躺的时候也要好好躺。偶尔摆烂无可厚非，休息是人之常情。\n\n健康之岛\n“健康之岛”实时展示用户当天的健康数据，比如步数、运动时间、消耗能量、身高、体重等。尤其是对于每日会更新变动的数据，是可以查看更新数据的（不过目前系统刷新问题，会有较多延迟）。\n\n \n以上就是OneWidget关于灵动岛功能的思考和功能的介绍。希望帮助大家了解灵动岛，也能够帮助大家通过这些小功能体验到灵动岛（实时活动）的用法。我们将继续做好一个“装修产品”，带来更多实用、美观、有趣的功能。\n回见。",

Display commits between any two dates (for example, 22 April 2022 and 24 April 2022):\n$ git log --oneline --since=\"2022-04-22\" --until=\"2022-04-24\"\nIn this example, the output displays all the commits between 22 April 2022 and 24 April 2022, which excludes the commits done on 22 April 2022. If you want to include the commits done on 22 April 2022, replace 2022-04-22 with 2022-04-21.\nRun the following command to display commits between any two dates by a specific author only (for example, Agil):\n$ git log --oneline --since=\"2022-04-22\" \\\n--until=\"2022-04-24\" --author=\"Agil\"\n\nReporting\nGit has many advantages, and one of them is the way it enables you to gather data about your project.

          "description": "@achariam and I came to a realization: despite how important building and maintaining relationships is to our personal and professional success, it's extremely difficult to do well.\n\nOur relationships are fragmented across so many places: iMessage, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, email, calendar – the list goes on! We never found a tool that worked quite right to help us be more thoughtful with our most important relationships.\n\nAfter trying to cobble together partial solutions in Notion, Airtable, Apple Notes, and Evernote, we decided to build Clay from the ground up to solve this exact problem.\n\nWe knew it had to be beautiful, private, and carefully crafted to respect the human element of relationships. We also knew that it had to work for all kinds of relationships, across many types of professions and lifestyles. And so we did over 1000 customer interviews to get to the heart of how people express care and show up for the people in their lives.\n\nClay is the culmination of all this research, design, and effort. We've taken the best elements from social networks, contacts apps, and CRMs to build the most beautiful way to manage your relationships in one place.\n\nOnce your entire network is in Clay, you can seamlessly:\n\n✅  Get a customized pre-meeting brief of all the people you're meeting with today\n📝  Take smart notes on your conversations and link related people together\n🔔  Set reminders to reach back out to someone\n🧠  Be prompted to reconnect with people with Clay's Reconnect AI\n🔍  Search your entire network in plain English\n📰  Stop doom scrolling social media and get can't-miss updates on news, job, and location updates\n💼  Find your next job or opportunity by leveraging your whole network in one place\n🎉  Never forget a birthday again\n🔥  And much more...\n\nAnd we're just getting started! We're big fans of the Product hunt community, thank you for your support — we think you're going to love Clay 🙌🏽\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
