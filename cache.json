They are regularly purchased and traded online in exchange for other cryptocurrencies, and they are typically encoded using the same software as many other cryptocurrencies.\nThe same kind of programming that is used to develop cryptocurrencies is typically used to create NFTs. These cryptographic assets are built on blockchain technology, to put it simply. They cannot be traded or exchanged in the same manner as other cryptographic assets.\nNFT stands for a non-fungible token, which means tha…",

          "description": "这个带有脚本的快速指南有助于清理旧的 Snap 版本并释放 Ubuntu 系统中的一些磁盘空间。\n\r\n\r\n我正在使用的 Ubuntu 测试系统中的磁盘空间不足。因此，我通过 GNOME 的磁盘使用分析器进行调查，以找出哪个包正在消耗宝贵的 SSD 空间。除了通常的缓存和主目录，令我惊讶的是，我发现 Snap 和 Flatpak 消耗了大量的存储空间。\n\r\n\n\r\n尽管如此，我始终坚持一个规则：除非必要，否则不要使用 Snap 或 Flatpak。这主要是因为它们的安装尺寸和其他问题。我更喜欢原生 deb 和 rpm 包。多年来，我在这个测试系统中安装和移除了一定数量的 Snap 包。\n\r\n但卸载后还有问题。Snap 在系统中保留了一些残留文件，一般用户不知道。\n\r\n所以我打开了 Snap 文件夹 /var/lib/snapd/snaps，发现 Snap 保留了以前安装/卸载的软件包的旧版本。\n\r\n例如，在下图中，你可以看到 GNOME 3.28、3.34 和 Wine 都被删除了。但它们还在那里。发生这种情况是因为 Snap 的设计，它在正确卸载后保留已卸载软件包的版本。\n\r\n\n\r\n或者，你可以在终端中使用：\n\r\nsnap list --all\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n对于保留的版本，默认值为 3。这意味着 Snap 会保留每个软件包的三个旧版本，包括活动版本。如果你对磁盘空间没有限制，这是可以的。\n\r\n但是对于服务器和其他情况，这很容易遇到成本问题，它会消耗你的磁盘空间。\n\r\n但是，你可以使用以下命令轻松修改计数。该值可以在 2 到 20 之间。\n\r\nsudo snap set system refresh.retain=2\r\n\n\r\n清理 Snap 版本\n\r\n在 SuperUser 的一篇文章中，Canonical 的前工程经理 Popey 提供了一个简单的脚本，它可以清理旧版本的 Snaps 并保留最新版本。\n\r\n这是我们将用来清理 Snap 的脚本。\n\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n#Removes old revisions of snaps\r\n#CLOSE ALL SNAPS BEFORE RUNNING THIS\r\nset -eu\r\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8 snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $3}' |\r\nwhile read snapname revision; do\r\n    snap remove \"$snapname\" --revision=\"$revision\"\r\ndone\r\n\n\r\n将上面的脚本以 .sh 扩展名保存在一个目录中（例如 clean_snap.sh），赋予它可执行权限并运行。\n\r\nchmod +x clean_snap.sh\r\n\n\r\n当我运行脚本后，它减少了很多磁盘空间。该脚本还将显示要删除的包的名称。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n结束语\n\r\n对于 Snap 的设计效率如何，人们总是争论不休。许多人说，它的设计是坏的，是臃肿的，是消耗系统资源的。这种说法的某些部分是真实的，我不会否认它。如果实施和加强得当，整个沙盒应用的概念是很好的。但我相信，与 Snap 相比，Flatpak 工作做得更好。\n\r\n也就是说，我希望这可以帮助你清理一些磁盘空间。尽管它只在 Ubuntu 中进行了测试，但它应该适用于所有支持 Snap 的 Linux 发行版。\n\r\n此外，请查看我们关于 如何清理 Ubuntu 的指南以及其他步骤。\n\r\n最后，如果你要清理 Flatpak 应用，请参阅 这篇指南。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/clean-up-snap/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

Clauser) 和安东·泽林格 (Anton Zeilinger)，以表彰他们 「进行了纠缠光子的实验，确立了对贝尔不等式的不成立并开创了量子信息科学」。阿兰·阿斯佩克特、约翰·克劳瑟和安东·泽林格分别利用处于相互纠缠的量子态进行了突破性的实验。在这种情况下，两个粒子即使被分开也表现得如同一个整体。他们的成果为基于量子信息的新技术扫清了道路。\n—— 摘自诺贝尔物理学奖官方新闻稿\n\n说实话，在诺贝尔奖委员会正式宣布量子纠缠相关的成果获奖后，我立刻就意识到，互联网上很快就会充斥着各种针对量子纠缠以及量子世界的神秘性相关的科普。这些科普，无论是原创的还是东拼西凑的，无论是专家学者起草的还是各路内容流水线上生产的，都有一个共同的特征：它们往往都喜欢强化量子物理的神秘性和不可理解。\n我承认，历史上确实有这么一段时间，即使是 20 世纪初期那些鼎鼎大名的物理学家，都曾为量子相关的物理现象感到困惑。然而，经过一百多年的发展，量子物理的诸多核心概念早就被一代又一代的物理学家里里外外地玩了个遍，以至于许多被科普作家渲染得神乎其神的概念，现正躺在物理系本科生的必修课教材里。\n当然，量子力学有它反直觉的地方。但是，现实生活中反直觉的事情还少吗？反直觉并不意味着神秘或不可理解。它只是需要你屏蔽你的许多生活常识，用绝对的理性来思考问题。所以，这篇文章会和你读过的绝大部分科普不同，我不会把量子…",

          "description": "前言\n2022年10月24日，特斯拉官宣降价，基础版本model 3降价1.4万，model y降价2.8万，可以说是非常大的降价幅度，结合2022款整体上更新的车机芯片加上扩大的电池容量，一部分车款可以说是重回性价比车型的行列。\n我们讲电车使用成本低，是基于有家用充电桩的环境，如果都用特斯拉超充，不算停车费，每公里电费都能到3毛以上，而使用谷时电家充，每公里电费可以控制在5分钱。但家充桩需要有固定车位，还要向电网申请电表，以及需要物业允许施工的证明，这些硬性条件也劝退着一些潜在车主。\n而除了固定的家用充电桩，还有便携充电器，也就是随车充可以作为新能源车的补能方案。随车充在使用上可以使用家庭插座，支持自带线缆从家中接到室外充电，不需要独立电表，对于公司有插座、农村有自建房以及低楼层居民楼住户都比较友好。\n本篇选择了四款随车充，覆盖了品牌、设计特点、功率支持的几个不同方向，来详细对比产品设计和具体功能，希望能为随车充的选择答疑解惑。\n缆上控制与保护装置（IC-CDP)\n\n其实随车充产品我分析过很多次，它本质上就是从电源到新能源车电机的连接装置，换言之就是一根电源线，电能转化为电池电量都是在新能源车内部完成的。而对于随车充产品消费首先需要重点关注的就是是否配备了缆上控制与保护装置，缩写为IC-CDP。\n在国家标准GB/T 18487.1-2015《电动汽车传导充电系统 第一部分:通用要求》中，将就是一根电缆连接电动汽车和交流电网的随车充称为模式1产品；将电缆上加入IC-CDP的随车充产品称为模式2产品。前者可以为车充电，根据电缆长度不同售价在200元上下，但模式1产品缺乏保护功能和控制功能，便宜但抗风险能力基本为0。后者模式2则是大部分车主的核心选择，通过控制盒可以实现各种差异化功能，特斯拉、比亚迪的原厂随车充我们称为车规产品，都是模式2随车充。\n对于我们私家车主而言，充电安全…",

          "description": "之前，我在《论文读不懂怎么办？》一文中，给你介绍了论文阅读遇到问题时的几个解决方法。尤其是介绍了你可以求助的免费资源和路径，它们包括但不限于：\n\n幻灯\n博客\n视频\n课程\n代码\n\n那篇文章，在知乎上获得了 2600 个赞（截止 2022 年 10 月）。我相信，对于很多同学，起到了帮助。\n\n只不过，环境和技术在变化，我们解决问题的方法和思路，也应该与时俱进。\n这不，因为有了大规模自然语言处理模型的加持，阅读论文时遇到不认识的名词，或者无法理解作者的简单解释时，我们有了一种新的对策。\n具体的方法，就是人工智能替你阅读后，把内容综合整理，结合上下文转换成简单清晰的语言，再反馈给你。\n这个想法，其实并不新鲜了。翻看近几年自然语言处理领域的论文，你能看见不少相关的研究。\n只不过，那些研究成果只存在论文中，或者是在某个实验室的电脑里面，普通人根本无法接触，更不要说利用了。\n这回可不一样，有人（ \\@amanjha__ and \\@functionofjade）居然真的就做了个产品出来。\n这个应用的名字，叫做 explainpaper ，非常直白吧？\n\n使用起来也特别方便。不用去菜单里面点选找寻。只要你把论文传上去，高亮某一个词语、短语或者段落，人工智能就会自动为你解读。\n\n不仅如此，你还可以就着 AI 反馈的结果，继续追问。\n这种应用演示不大适合图文。所以我干脆为你做了 一段演示视频，你可以先看看。\n \n \n看完之后，感受如何？\n反正不少小伙伴表示，很兴奋。\n\n这东西背后的技术是啥？当然还是咱们的老熟人 ------GPT-3.\n其实 GPT-3 这模型的特点，说穿了就是大。因为模型庞大，参数众多，所以从海量语料库里积攒的「认知」就多。注意我这里刻意回避了「知识」这个词儿。\n\n（资料来源：t.ly/cY1kn）\n从上图中，你不难看到，现在的文本和代码生成中，GPT-3 都占据了重要位置。\n我喜欢共享内容的原因之一，是视频发出后总可以获得观众进一步的反馈。不少的问题，都会激发我的思考。\n例如有小伙伴在视频后面提问，说这个东西能不能帮着理解中文论文啊？\n\n这是个很好的问题。毕竟很多国内人文社科研究生平时阅读的论文，更大比例是中文的。\n我一开始觉得这个问题问得有些太贪心了。对于一个外国人做的刚上线应用，你指望人家立即支持阅读中文，还能看懂中文的研究论文，不大现实吧？\n刚要回复，我突然想起来 上次在 Lex 上面的教训了。既然 explainpaper 的底层模型是 GPT-3 ，那它本来就该认得中文啊。\n为了确保回答准确，还是实际测试一下吧。我传了一篇自己的论文上去。\n\n中文划线高亮之后，AI 反馈的结果让我有些吃惊。\n尽管 explainpaper 并不能直接用中文来解释信息。但它可以立即识别出「知识管理」就是 knowledge management ，然后进一步解释下去。\n下面这段解释，就更有意思了。\n\n它先广泛解释「插件」是啥，然后结合本文的上下文，指出 Roam Toolkit 是一种插件，并且描述了它的功能。\n不仅如此，从下图可以看出，就连划线的时候字符之间出现了空格间隔，也依然能正常识别和解释。\n\n下面，我故意找了个文中没有进行详细解释的「概念网络」，结果是这样的。\n\n我能确定，这解释里面出现的「宠物」、「猫」、「狗」啥的，肯定没在本文正文出现过。\nEvernote 这一段，让我愣住了。\n\nExplainpaper 居然是准确识别了这张表格，并且把内容总结梳理，然后用英文输出了出来。\n上述的演示，是不是回答了读者的问题呢？我觉得算不上。从需求分析来看，人家看中文论文遇到术语不清楚，自然是需要中文的解释。你再弄成英文给我，这......\n可换个角度想想，这东西帮助外国人阅读中文论文，可是再好不过了。遇到中文专业词汇，随时可以获得准确的英文解释，而且阐述还贴合论文的上下文。外国人读中文论文，将减少很多障碍。这或许可以快速提升中文论文的影响力，妙啊！\n另外，目前 explainpaper 缺乏中文解释能力，也给国内的开发者提供了发展空间。希望早日看到更多 AI 实际应用上线，帮助国人理解中文论文。\n我期待你能自己尝试一下这款在线应用。至少在目前，它是免费的。而且因为上传的都是公开发表的论文，也不存在用户隐私泄漏问题。所以可以放心大胆地尝试 ------ 特别是对于最近要写文献综述的小伙伴来说。\n欢迎你把自己测试的结果和经验心得，分享在留言区。咱们一起交流讨论。\n祝论文阅读愉快！\n如果你觉得本文有用，请充电。\n如果本文可能对你的朋友有帮助，请转发给他们。\n欢迎关注我的专栏「科研利器」，以便及时收到后续的更新内容。\n \n \n延伸阅读\n如何高效入门 Logseq ？\n互联网上的时光机器\n如何高效学 Python？\nVOSviewer 中文视频教程\n【知识星球精选】刻意练习区的辅助线",

It uses a C-like syntax, but is dynamically typed, features automatic memory management and garbage collection, and runs by interpreting bytecode with a register-based virtual machine. This makes it a great language for beginners, but also a powerful tool for experienced programmers.\nLua has been somewhat eclipsed from the public view by languages like Python and JavaScript, but Lua has several advantages that make it popular in some major software projects.

And I'm sure you all have the same opinion 😗\n\nWhen deploying APIs, whether Firebase or AWS, I think you need to create a project and configure it in advance. When you are making an MVP for a product, this kind of hassle is very disturbing :/\n\nKuiq eliminates all of this hassle and allows you to deploy your API as soon as you log in to Kuiq 😁\n\nIs this the same as Deno Deploy?\nAlmost same. But different pricing model.\n\nFuture of Kuiq\n✍️ Create a VSCode extension so code can be sent directly from VSCode to Kuiq\n\n🤖 API with Database concept (not sure yet)\nWhen we do backend processing with API, we often want to manipulate the database.\nFor example, storing customer email data.\nSo I thought that having a database connected to an API that can be easily deployed might speed up the development of the product :)\n\nLooking forward to your thought! \nTry it out over here 👉 https://kuiq.io/\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "@packwhale) and I’m thrilled to launch today on Product Hunt!!!\nAbout me: I’ve been working in online marketing for nearly a decade and I’ve always been curious about new tools that can make my life as a marketer easier.\n\nI’ve often seen people stare at their Google Analytics dashboard without really doing something actionable or meaningful to understand what’s going on with their data. \n\nSo I created the Google Analytics Pack for Coda to analyze my data, generate notes, and facilitate discussions with my team so we improve our website’s performance. You can even set up automations when you hit milestones—like Slacking your team when web traffic hits 1M views. Here’s a glimpse of what you can do:\n\n✅ Use cases: \n* Build and share custom reports for your team and stakeholders. \n* Invite your team to analyze your website’s performance together.\n* Make data-based decisions, plan your marketing campaigns, and build custom automations for your data. \n\nSpecial thanks to the @coda_hq team for their support 🙌\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
