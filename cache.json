Why do I feel guilty about myself for not dominating every single framework, language, platform or technology? Because that’s imposter’s syndrome creeping in.\nFirstly, you need to realise that you simply can’t do it all… That voice telling you that you're not good enough? Reply with a \"hold my beer\" and let it know that you're going to raise the bar, that you're going to broaden your knowledge and once you come back, you will be able to proudly draw a big smile. There may be people out there that are better than you, but that doesn't mean that you can't get any better! Sectors such as IT are constantly evolving and require constant training and updating.\nSome people, including me, tend to underestimate themselves (consciously or unconsciously) and I would like to say something to all of you: you might not know it, but you are a reference for a lot of people. Maybe not (only) because of your hard skills but also because of your soft skills or simply because of the story of what you have experienced.\nRaise your head, draw that smile once again and hug your imposter's syndrome: it might be your excuse for not trusting and resting on your laurels.",

          "description": "I just came back from the short holidays that I took to once again go to Budapest (Hungary) and enjoy the hobby that I love the most which is Technical Diving!\n\nI decided to write this post purely because how refreshing it was for me to take even three days off. It allowed me to come back to work and community stuff with fresh mind and new ideas.\nI am currently in several processes both in my work and outside it (doing community stuff) so just before the holidays, I felt quite overwhelmed with the stuff that needed my attention. After coming back, I managed to finish all of them easily, and I believe that if I was doing them instead of my days off, I might not close all of them the same way. Not to mention new ideas that popped to my mind ;)\nBelow, I listed some of my favourite pictures from this trip. Enjoy!\n\n\n\nAnd I wrote this article for you to show that a bit of rest is needed from time to time to free your mind. Thanks to it, you will be able to find new ideas and sort things out. Not to mention that it is just fun as well.",

          "description": "Audacity 是一个自由开源的跨平台 音频编辑器。专业人士使用它是因为它提供的功能仅需安装很小的软件包。\n\r\n你不必成为一名专业人士并使用它的所有功能。你可以使用它从麦克风录制音频，并执行一些基本操作，如背景噪声消除。\n\r\n我将在本教程中向你展示如何做到这一点。\n\r\n在 Linux 上安装 Audacity\n\r\n在 Linux 上安装 Audacity 是一个非常简单的过程。由于其受欢迎，可以在大多数 Linux 发行版的官方存储库中找到它。\n\r\n你可以在发行版的软件中心或软件包管理器中搜索它。\n\r\n作为一个终端爱好者，让我分享一下常见发行版的命令。\n\r\n对于基于 Debian 或 Ubuntu 的发行版：\n\r\nsudo apt install audacity\r\n\n\r\n对于基于 RHEL 或 Fedora 的发行版：\n\r\nsudo dnf install audacity\r\n\n\r\n如果你在用基于 Arch 的发行版：\n\r\nsudo pacman -Syu audacity\r\n\n\r\n注意，通过官方存储库安装可能无法获得 最新版本。要获得最新版本，你可以使用 AppImage 或 Flatpak/Snap 软件包。\n\r\n使用 Audacity 录制音频\n\r\n安装 Audacity 后，从应用程序菜单打开它或从终端启动它。你会看到这样的界面：\n\r\n\n\r\n单击“录制”按钮（红点）即可轻松开始录制。完成后，单击“ 停止”按钮（方形图标）来结束录制。你还可以预览录制的波形，如下所示：\n\r\n\n\r\n然后，你可以通过单击“播放”按钮（绿色图标）检查录制的内容。\n\r\n如果你没有看到任何波形，则表示未录制到任何内容。很可能，你没有正确设置音频输入。确保你选择了正确的麦克风，并确保在“系统设置system settings”中其未被静音。你也可以通过 Audacity 接口设置。\n\r\n录音不会自动保存为 MP3 或其他格式。要保存录音，你可以转到 “文件File → 导出Export” 并选择 “导出为 MP3Export as MP3”（或任何其他想要的格式）。\n\r\n使用 Audacity 降低背景噪声\n\r\nAudacity 还有另一个很棒的功能，你可以使用它来减少录制音频中的白噪声。\n\r\n最好的做法是在开始使用 Audacity 录制时的前五秒不要说任何话。这将为你提供所需的背景噪声。\n\r\n在录制音频的波形上，选择你认为是背景噪声的部分。\n\r\n\n\r\n选择噪声部分后，从顶部文件菜单中转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”。\n\r\n它会像这样打开一个弹出窗口。单击此处的 “获取噪音配置文件Get Noise Profile”。\n\r\n\n\r\n现在，你已经设置了噪声配置文件。现在，你必须使用它来减少录音中的噪声。\n\r\n按 Ctrl + A 快捷键选择整段录音。你也可以选择其中的一部分，仅对所选部分减少噪声。\n\r\n选择音轨后，再次转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”。\n\r\n这次不要单击 “获取噪音配置文件Get Noise Profile”。这一次，你应该能够按下 “OK” 按钮。\n\r\n只需按下 “OK” 按钮，即可将降噪效果应用到录音中，并反映在波形上，如下所示：\n\r\n\n\r\n现在，相较而言，录制的音频将具有更少的噪声。你可以在选择 “降低噪音Noise Reduction” 效果时微调噪声过滤。\n\r\n总结如下：\n\r\n\r\n选择噪声部分，转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”，然后单击 “获取噪音配置文件Get Noise Profile”\n\r\n按 Ctrl + A 选择整段音频录制，转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”，这次按 OK 按钮\n\r\n\r\n请注意，你无法移除所有类型的噪声，但这应该会有所帮助。\n\r\nAudacity 能做更多事情\n\r\n使用 Audacity 录制音频可能不像使用 GNOME 录音机那样简单，但它并不太复杂。如果你正在录制画外音，降噪功能将非常有用。\n\r\nAudacity 有更多其他功能，不可能在一个教程中涵盖所有这些功能。这就是为什么我会保持简短的原因。\n\r\n如果你不能接受 2021 年的 Audacity 的隐私政策调整，试试其他可用的工具。\n\r\n我希望这个小教程能帮助你使用 Audacity 进行音频录制。如果你有问题或建议，请告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/audacity-recording/\n\r\n作者：Anuj Sharma 选题：lkxed 译者：FYJNEVERFOLLOWS 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "以下是你如何在 Debian、Ubuntu 和其他发行版中修复 “sudo command not found” 错误的方法。\n\r\n\r\n有时，当你第一次设置或安装 Linux 发行版 时，你在用 sudo 尝试一些命令时，会出现 “sudo command not found” 的错误。\n\r\nsudo 命令是 “superuser do” 的缩写，它是一个允许用户以管理员权限执行命令的程序。sudo 命令帮助你像管理员用户一样运行程序/命令。\n\r\n此外，用 sudo 运行命令的用户必须是 sudo 组的一部分。\n\r\n你看到这个错误的主要原因是该软件包本身没有安装。然而，大多数现代 Linux 发行版都默认提供了这个功能，但有些则没有。\n\r\n下面是解决这个问题需要遵循的步骤。\n\r\n故障排除 #1\n\r\n首先，安装 sudo 包来解决这个问题。打开一个终端，刷新你的系统，并运行以下命令来安装 sudo。\n\r\n对于 Ubuntu、Debian 和相关发行版：\n\r\nsu -apt updateapt install sudo\r\n\n\r\n对于 Arch Linux：\n\r\npacman -S sudo\r\n\n\r\n对于 Fedora、RHEL 等：\n\r\nsu -dnf updatednf install sudo\r\n\n\r\n上述安装完成后，你必须使用以下命令将用户添加到 sudo 组中。\n\r\nusermod -aG sudo <yourusername>\r\n\n\r\n然后从终端运行 visudo，并运行以下行。按 CTRL+O 和 CTRL+X 来保存和退出。\n\r\n\n\r\n退出并再次登录使变化生效。\n\r\n故障排除 #2\n\r\n在做了上述改变之后，如果你仍然收到错误信息，那么请按照以下步骤操作。\n\r\n确保你的 $PATH 变量包含 sudo 可执行文件的正确路径。如果 sudo 已经安装，但 $PATH 不正确，你也会得到这个错误。理想情况下，你的路径应该包含以下所有的路径。\n\r\necho $PATH\r\n\n\r\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin\r\n\n\r\n要改变路径变量，使用以下命令。例如，如果 /usr/bin 不存在，那么你可以通过以下方式添加它。\n\r\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin\r\n\n\r\n然后注销并登录查看效果。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n我希望这个指南能帮助你解决 Linux 发行版中的 sudo 错误。表面上的解决方案很简单，真的。\n\r\n如果有帮助，或者如果你有任何问题，请在下面留言。\n\r\n\r\n参考\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/sudo-command-not-found/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "人要坚持一件事情真的很难，一不小心，少数派思考就鸽了一个多月。上周六我上了一次「得到」的直播，也是罗振宇老师的年度演讲策划会，在会上我提出了两个观点，在这里跟大家分享一下。\n用实业心态创业，用实业思维做互联网产品\n这句话其实在我脑海中已经很多年了，可能跟我之前从事的传统行业有关系。不管是做哪个行业和产品，我都非常在意它给用户提供的本质价值，比如我推销过纳米汽车清洁产品，就会一直纠结它的实际效果怎么样，不断反馈问题；我出口过弹簧钢丝，也更关注海外客户的使用反馈，了解我们的工艺跟其他国家的差距在哪里。\n但互联网的兴起，好像改变了这些底层规则，因为要快、要规模、所以要免费，羊毛要出在猪身上。不知不觉，服务和产品的本质都被动摇了。我非常感恩互联网，因为这个工具和时代，让给我有了创业的机会，帮我把爱好变成了事业，但我不迷信互联网，它是一个好工具，但不是产品和服务的本质。\n简单举两个例子：\n今天的外卖让我们的餐饮高效便利，但餐饮的本质是菜品和味道，如果菜品难吃又不干净，你送餐的速度的再快也没有意义，我能忍一次两次，忍不了第三次。\n今天的娱乐，让我们随时随地可以听音乐，看电影，但平台的争斗和互卷，让创作者无奈，让好的内容越来越少，最终变得没什么可看了。\n所以，一个产品和服务，要想保持长期可持续的生命力，就要回归用户需求，用实业思维把东西夯实，夯成自己的真正壁垒，它可能会很慢，规模也不大，但它可以穿越周期，做成百年老店。接下来十年，可能是一个慢下来的新周期，这个思维就更加重要。\n直播中有一个提前准备的问题，没来得及讲，我可以在这里补充一下：\n当下环境，你会给准备创业的朋友哪些建议和叮嘱？\n先想好怎样活下来，今天的市场更加残酷，没有红利、没有资本，用户更谨慎和挑剔。\n少讲故事，如果你的业务短期内没法商业化，就要想好长期策略，比如控制成本，小步快跑等等。\n别追风口，多关注细分市场的机会，关注年轻的主力消费人群，未来是创意和个性化的时代。\n不要社恐，不要闭门造车，要主动联络和运用身边的一切资源。\n创新不是颠覆，是将好做到优秀，再把优秀做成经典的过程\n这句话不是我说的，而是来自 150 年历史的德国莱茵公司。三年前我前往德国参观了他们的公司和业务，七天行程的结束，莱茵大中华区电子电气副总裁 Jay 总结了这句话，引发了我的思考。\n巧合的是，我八年前做出口业务的时候，有很多欧洲的客户，我去了解他们的背景，发现大多都是做了几十年的企业。他们都是深耕自己的领域，比如一家制造扫街刷子的公司，从塑料制刷改成钢丝刷，从扫街到扫管道，不停优化工艺，不停的延伸拓展，始终保持自己的市场地位。\n而互联网时代，我们经常讲创新，讲颠覆，强调一个技术出现，就会改变一个行业，我就是这个行业的佼佼者。我们承认趋势的存在，但趋势是波浪，一旦过去了，你还要靠自己的实力去创造价值，只是这个趋势周期比较长，我们还没有真正经历和感受过低谷。\n所以我后来一直思考这句话，它可能就是一个百年企业的运营真谛，不要觉得事情小，而是关注它的价值。150 年前的莱茵公司，是给蒸汽锅炉做安全认证的，因为品质不统一，操作不规范，它经常出现致命的事故，先做好这件事，保证工人的生命安全。后面再一点点拓展到更多的领域，最后形成了人人信赖的品牌。\n做一份少数派的报告\n虽然，以上这些海外企业的成长经历，跟我们的周期和环境有很大区别，但我依然认同这些底层的观点：把一件事情做好做透，拥有你最核心的用户群，先完成你基本的商业闭环，然后再围绕用户和市场的需求去慢慢拓展。这跟以往的互联网思维是基本相悖的，但从更高的维度和更长的周期来看，我依然相信这是正确的。\n我们在直播中聊到，是不是可以整理一个具备这些特质的企业清单，讲讲他们的故事，我们可以把它叫做真正的《少数派报告》，也希望这些案例，能在寒冬之中，引领更多创业者找到自己的方向。",

          "description": "虽然现在多屏用户逐渐变多，但仍是小众，Windows 也并没过对多屏使用进行太多的优化。所以只好自己动手，于是有了以下一些个人自用的优化设置。\n窗口出现位置优化\nWindows 系统仅对多屏用户提供了简单主显示器的设置，默认情况下所有新打开的窗口都只会出现在主显示器上，即使你在使用另一个的显示器。而「基于显示器连接记住窗口位置」只能记住上次关闭时所在的屏幕，实用性并不高。\n\n这时微软自家的 Power Toys 里的 FancyZones 就可以派上用场了，除了我们熟知的窗口布局设置外，它还可以调整窗口行为，在这里我们可以通过启用「将新创建的窗口移动到当前 活动的监视器（实验性）」来达到这一效果，美中不足的是动画不够优雅。\n\n窗口出现的问题解决了，但任务栏上默认是显示所有屏幕上的窗口，不能让我们快速区分哪些应用是在当前屏幕下的。\n\n为了解决该问题，如下图所示，Windows 提供了简陋的选项加让人摸不着头脑的翻译。设置后，每个屏幕下的任务栏就只显示当前屏幕下打开的窗口，更符合直觉，不过 Win + 数字 的快捷键就只能在主显示器上使用了。\n\n内容显示优化\n现在 Windows 下大部分的应用都适配高 DPI 的，少部分不支持的，也可以通过 Windows 自带的属性 - 兼容性选项来调整。\n\n上面的设置仅解决了单个应用在高分辨率屏幕下的问题，并不能解决应用在分辨率相差太大的显示器间移动时会出现界面变形问题。这时，如果你使用的 AMD 显卡，那你可以通过启用 AMD Radeon Software 里的「超虚拟分辨率」来让低分辨率屏切换到更高的逻辑分辨率，不仅缩小的多屏间的分辨率差距，还有抗锯齿的效果。由于个人没有使用 Nvidia 和 Intel 显卡，相关选项是否存在请自行到显卡设置里翻找。\n\n设置完成后到 Windows 设置调整下逻辑分辨率和缩放即可。\n\n除此之外，对于我们网上冲浪必备的浏览器，它的缩放是固定的，且只有一个设置选项。不知道有没有人跟我一样两个屏幕的缩放比例是不一样的，在两个屏幕间移动浏览器时，网页内容并不会根据 DPI 而变化，导致观感割裂。在这里我推荐一个 FireFox 浏览器插件：ffreszoom，它可以实时感知屏幕宽度的变化，当宽度超过指定值时，自动调整到指定缩放比例。设置前先通过这个网站查看自己的屏幕宽度：http://whatismyscreenresolution.net/，需要将 Firefox 浏览器移动到不同显示器上刷新。\n\n如图所示我的外屏宽度是 1728 px，笔记本内屏为 1024，所以我在两者之间随意取了一个值用于判断，若当前屏幕宽度超过 1600 px，就自动设置缩放为 1.5，也即 150%。若小于 1600 px，则使用浏览器设置里的值。两种缩放无缝切换，只会多了一个缩放的动画。由于本人没使用 Chromium 类浏览器，并没有对应的插件推荐，不过其用户这么多，应该会有类似的插件。\n\n利用「闲置的」触摸板\n不知有没有跟我一样喜欢使用笔记本键盘的，且平时一些简单的操作直接用触摸板直接操作。现在 Windows 11 已经支持自定义触摸板多指手势了，但其不能根据不同应用设置不同的手势，例如：A 软件可以用 Ctrl  + W 关闭，但 B 软件只能用 Alt + F4，同一个操作有不同的快捷键。\n\n这时就需要第三方软件了，这里我推荐 GestureSign，界面虽然是 Windows 10 风格，但不影响使用，毕竟设置完就不用再看了。它可以为不同应用的不同快捷键键设置相同的触控手势，手势类型也不再仅限于横平竖直，可以自由发挥。同时软件也内置了一些常用的命令供选择。\n\n上图是我的一些设置，双指一般使用系统默认就不添加上去了。其中个人最爱的是三指滑动切换标签，体验比鼠标点击更加符合人的直觉。对于频繁使用搜索启动器的我，把三指上滑指定为搜索启动器的快捷键，方便呼出。\n \n对了，设置前记得把系统自带的相关手势取消掉，不然会冲突。若你仍不习惯使用触摸板，该软件也支持鼠标手势，具体可以自行下载体验。\n结尾\n以上便是我在使用多屏时遇到的问题，及相关解决方法，希望对多屏用户有帮助。",

You can use an array to store information in a structured way. It's useful to know the various ways you can retrieve that data when you need it.

Variety reports that Amazon has tapped Invasion co-creator Dave Weil to executive produce the currently unnamed eight episode miniseries that details how Bankman-Fried co-founded FTX, and went on to lead the company to a liquidity crisis that ultimately resulted in his being ousted.

I ran into the issue last week, and found that others are also dealing with it.\nThe issue seems to specifically occur on Apple TV 4K devices (all generations) running tvOS 16.1, and is happening on the latest HBO Max app version 52.50.1 (released Nov 16, 2022). For some, the issue is intermittent, and can be dodged through simple troubleshooting steps like force quitting the app, logging out of the app, reinstalling it, or restarting the Apple TV.\nHBO’s SVP of Communications Chris Willard tells The Verge they’re “aware and working on a fix.” The company’s specialized support team followed up with my...\nContinue reading…",

The draft policy, which outlines how the SFPD can use military-style weapons, states robots can be “used as a deadly force option when risk of loss of life to members of the public or officers is imminent and outweighs any other force option.”\nAs reported by Mission Local, members of the city’s Board of Supervisors Rules Committee have been reviewing the new equipment policy for several weeks.
