Sort of like a personal Stack Overflow.\nIt allows me to note any ideas for future reference\nAllows me to keep track of time/progress and any unfinished tasks\nIt notifies me the next day of what leftover tasks still need to be completed\nIt gives future me a laugh, when I look back at the memo's I wrote a year ago 😅\nI always start with the day's TODO/s, ordered from the most important to the least important.\nThen I give each todo a separate heading, I then actually start working on the todo, noting anything important including any problems/errors etc I encounter. Any problems encountered I always right the solution and how I solved it as well as tagging the error for future reference. \nAt the end I write what still needs to be done and what I need to do Tomorrow.\nThe software I use to do this used to be Evernote, but recently I've switched to a tool called \"Joplin\" which is free to use and open source. Notes can also be backed up to DropBox/Self Hosted Server.\nhttps://joplinapp.org/\nHere I have shared my reasons why every dev should keep a dev diary. \nPlease feel free to share if you keep a dev diary, if you do please give me your reasons for keeping one.\nHappy Coding! 🤓",

A similar approach can be taken to problems in social media, travel, biology, computer chip design, mapping the progression of neuro-degenerative diseases, and many other fields.

          "description": "Pressable component was introduced in 2020 as a core component wrapper that can be used instead of existing touchable components in React Native. These touchable components are TouchableOpacity, TouchableHighlight, and TouchableWithoutFeedback. These components include styles and effects that sometimes do not meet the desired outcome on individual platforms (iOS and Android).\nThe way I see using the Pressable component is that it can be customized in terms of style, appearance, and extended functionality by creating a custom wrapper/component around it. It also offers a lot of props such as onPressIn, onPressLong, hitSlop, delayLongPress and so on, that can be used to implement these extended functionalities.\nAt times, one thing I like to do is to add opacity feedback when the touch is act…",

          "description": "推特创始人说他最大的遗憾是推特成为一家公司\n\r\n在回答关于“推特是否变成了他所设想的那样”的问题时，推特创始人 Jack Dorsey 说，“最大的问题和我最大的遗憾是它变成了一家公司”，他进一步说，这应该是“一种协议”，推特不应该由国家或其他公司拥有。如果它是一种协议，那么推特的运作就会很像电子邮件，它不受一个中央实体的控制，使用不同电子邮件供应商的人能够相互沟通。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：路透社\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这是真正有开放情怀的人的想法，虽然未必是一条成功之路。不过，已经有类似的“协议”出现，也许真的会出现一个这样的去中心化的推特。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nRHEL 10 将取消 GTK2 工具包支持，最大绊脚石可能是 GIMP\n\r\n虽然 GTK2 工具包在 Linux 应用程序中已经使用了很久，但 GTK3 已经推出了十多年，连 GTK4 也已经推出了两年。大多数著名的 Linux 软件已经从 GTK2 移植到 GTK3 或 GTK4，但也有少数例外，包括 GIMP 和它酝酿已久的 GIMP 3.0 版本仍在使用 GTK2。GTK 最初是来自于 GIMP 项目的一个副产品，是 GIMP 本身的底层框架。红帽称，“这个工具包为我们提供了很好的服务，但在现代技术方面，如 Wayland、HiDPI 屏幕、HDR 和其他方面，它开始显示出它已经开始老化。”RHEL 10 计划在 2025 年推出稳定版。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这应该对大部分使用 GTK 的图形应用没有什么影响，基本上都使用了较新的 GTK 了。但是有趣的是，GIMP 这么多年一直抱着老旧的 GTK2 不升级，反而成为升级换代的最大绊脚石。难怪 GIMP 这么多年还那个样子。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nHeroku 宣布取消免费计划\n\r\n在提供了十多年的服务后，Heroku 本周宣布，它将取消所有的免费服务。Heroku 是一个支持多种编程语言的云平台，允许程序员使用 Java、PHP、Scala 和 Go 等编程语言构建、运行和扩展应用程序。它是最早的云平台之一，其声称被用于开发了 1300 万个应用程序。Heroku 将免费服务的消亡归咎于“滥用”，将于 10 月底开始删除不活跃的账户和超过一年的账户的相关存储，并在 11 月底停止提供免费产品计划，并关闭免费数据服务。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Tech Crunch\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：又一个免费服务的消失，但是根本原因还是找不到免费服务的生存价值，或者说，免费服务不能给他们带来足够的潜在利益。",

          "description": "任何考虑在开源领域发展的人都具有无限的可能性。下面是我的故事。\n\r\n\r\n当人们问我最喜欢开源的什么时，我的回答很简单：那就是 开放性 。在开源中，社区开发者和贡献者所做的工作是在公共领域的，所有人都能看到并从中受益。我对这一理念爱不释手。\n\r\n有多少人可以对他们的劳动成果这样说？有多少人，也许在 50 年后，可以回过头来说：“看看我那天写的代码，有几百/几千/几万人从中受益。”我觉得这比从事那些对世界上大多数人来说都是隐秘的软件工作更令人无比兴奋。\n\r\n我很幸运，我的工作使我置身于一个开源和企业交叉的有趣领域中。如今，我是 OpenNMS 集团 的首席技术官，这家公司负责维护 OpenNMS 项目。OpenNMS 是一个领先的开源网络监控和管理平台。\n\r\n虽然我现在的角色让我牢牢扎根于开源领域，但我是以用户和贡献者身份开始的。\n\r\n2007 年，我得到了我的第一份真正的技术工作，在加拿大蒙特利尔的电信服务提供商 Datavalet 技术公司从事网络分析。在五年的时间内，我成长为解决方案架构师，任务是帮助公司选择网络管理解决方案。我们选择了 OpenNMS，正是通过这次经历，我认识到了开源的真正力量。\n\r\n在平台上线时，我们发现了一些缺失的功能，这些功能将有助于优化我们的体验。一位来自 OpenNMS 集团的代表在现场帮助我们进行部署，并建议我参加社区即将举行的 DevJam，与核心开发人员一起建立我们需要的功能。\n\r\n在 DevJam 期间，我很快就融入了团队和社区。我们卷起袖子，开始编码，以创建 Datavalet 所需的增强功能。在几天之内，这个附加的功能就准备好了。这是一次令人惊叹的变革性经历，让我真正看到了开源的力量。\n\r\n一年后，我离职了，在康科迪亚大学全日制学习数学。正是在那里，我再次有机会与 OpenNMS 团队合作，这一次是在该年的谷歌代码之夏的一个项目上。在这个年度计划中，参与者的目标是成功完成开源软件开发项目。\n\r\n代码之夏对我来说是一次改变职业生涯的经历。OpenNMS 的两位负责人参加了我们的项目演示，一年后，OpenNMS 团队邀请我作为一名全栈开发人员加入。\n\r\n我努力工作，迅速晋升，并在 2015 年被任命为首席技术官。我认为这是一项个人成就，也再次验证了开源世界的特别之处。如果你喜欢与社区合作，热爱你所做的工作，你的贡献很快就会得到认可。\n\r\n开源精神也影响了我从个人贡献者到首席技术官的发展，我现在领导着一个由 50 多人组成的产品开发团队。社区本质上是平等的，我与社区贡献者一起工作的经验教会了我如何在环境中领导，而不是控制。\n\r\n我经历了一段奇妙的开源旅程，从用户到贡献者，再到一家开源公司的高管。开源方法超越了技术，因为专有开发环境中经常存在的障碍的进入和增长可以通过协作、透明和社区来克服。因此，对于任何考虑在开源领域工作的人来说，可能性是无限的。我就是证明。\n\r\n我们生活在一个人们正在深刻审视自己的生活及其对世界的影响的时代。在开源公司工作特别有意义，因为我可以直接与用户社区互动并影响他们。终端用户和开发人员之间的经典屏障被打破了，我可以确切地看到我的工作如何改变人们的日常生活，或者激励人们为项目做出贡献。通过对一个项目的共同热爱来建立社区，建立持续一生的联系。\n\r\n我知道这对我来说都是真实的，这也是为什么我对我的工作如此热情。我是一个彻头彻尾的开源极客，并以此为荣。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/8/my-open-source-career-story\n\r\n作者：Jesse White 选题：lkxed 译者：aftermath0703 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

Most of these misconceptions focus on security, flexibility, and central management. In this article, I will debunk some of these myths.\nMany misconceptions likely arise because users know only the basic functionality of sudo. The sudoers file, by default, has only two rules: The root user, and members of the administrative wheel group, can do practically anything using sudo. There are barely any limits, and optional features are not enabled at all. Even this setup is better than sharing the root password, as you can usually follow who did what on your systems using the logs. However, learnin…",

The streamer reportedly decided against renewing the series due to lackluster ratings and viewership.\nLike the many other Resident Evil adaptations, Netflix’s live-action series attempts to put yet another spin on the video game franchise it’s based on. The show, which was helmed by Supernatural’s Andrew Dabb, flashes between two different timelines, centering around Umbrella executive Albert Wesker (Lance Reddick) and his two daughters (played by Tamara Smart and Siena Agudong). \nIn our review of the series, my colleague Charles Pulliam-Moore notes that it “keeps things feeling fresh up to a point,” but...\nContinue reading…",

It guides you through a simple workflow to brainstorm, define, progress, review and accomplish your goals. It’s set up as an iterative system to get better at getting better. \n\nWhat’s included?\n\n- Resources and guides on goal-setting based on work of various authors such as Stephen Covey, Bill Burnett & Dave Evans, Naval Ravikant and Chris Bailey\n- A clean dashboard for your goals which you can orient your existing goal management systems around\n- Checklists and templates that guide you through the processes of setting and checking in with your goals.\n\nWhy did I make it?\n\nIt was the scratch-your-own-itch-factor. Well, more than just my own itch. Whenever I ask my team and friends what they struggle with the most it's unanimously goal setting. Wat goals should I set? How do I define good goals? How do I stay on track? As COO and Product Manager at our 40-employee business I landed on OKRs as the goal-setting framework of preference. So, After having tried and tested the system for the past years it felt like the right thing to launch as my first indie-project. \n\nI’ve been eager to start with independent projects for a while now. As ferocious Product Hunt follower it’s incredibly exciting to be on the launching-end for the first time. I’m grateful for my colleagues and online-friends who’ve encouraged me to take this step. And, a massive shout out to the Product Hunt community for nurturing such a great launch pad.\n\nIn celebration of the launch all Product Hunters get 50% off with code: ph50 \n\n\nI’m excited to see your feedback and happy to answer any questions you might have!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
