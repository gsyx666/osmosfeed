It's declarative, efficient, and flexible.\nBut have you ever wondered how React actually works behind the scenes? Let's take a look at how React operates on a fundamental level.\nReact is a JavaScript library that creates and maintains an in-memory representation of a UI. When a user interacts with a React application, React updates the in-memory representation and the changes are reflected in the UI.\nReact uses a virtual DOM, which is a JavaScript representation of the actual DOM. The virtual DOM is a lightweight tree that contains only the necessary information to render a UI.\nWhen a user interacts with a React application, React updates the virtual DOM. React then compares the virtual DOM with the actual DOM. React makes…",

          "description": "This time we will discuss the best implementation in using setState in useState in useEffect in React. React developers will often be faced with situations where they have to setState on useEffect, such as when we want to load data from the database and want it to be stored in a state, then we have to retrieve the data in the database and save the query results to the state using useEffect. However, this implementation often creates problems that are sometimes not realized and can have fatal impacts.\nOn this occasion, we will discuss states with primitive data values (integers, strings, booleans, etc.) and states with data values in the form of objects.\nIn a state that is implemented using primitive data, it's actually not that complicated and has been widely exemplified in various forums …",

          "description": "Snap 是由 Ubuntu 的母公司 Canonical 设计的通用包格式。有些人不喜欢 Snap，但它有一些优势。\n\r\n通常，某些应用仅以 Snap 格式提供。这为你提供了在 Arch Linux 中启用 Snap 的充分理由。\n\r\n我知道 AUR 拥有大量应用，但 Snap 应用通常直接来自开发人员。\n\r\n如果你希望能够在 Arch Linux 中安装 Snap 应用，你需要先启用 Snap 支持。\n\r\n有两种方法可以做到：\n\r\n\r\n使用 AUR 助手启用 Snap 支持（更简单）\n\r\n通过从 AUR 获取包，手动启用 Snap 支持\n\r\n\r\n让我们看看怎么做。\n\r\n方法 1、使用 AUR 助手启用 Snap\n\r\nSnap 支持在 Arch 用户仓库中以 snapd 包的形式提供。你可以使用 AUR 助手轻松安装它。\n\r\n有 许多 AUR 助手，但 yay 是我更喜欢的，因为它的语法类似于 pacman 命令。\n\r\n如果你还没有安装 AUR，请使用以下命令安装 Yay（需要事先安装 git）：\n\r\ngit clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay\r\n\r\ncd yay\r\n\r\nmakepkg -si\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n现在 yay 已安装，你可以通过以下方式安装 snapd：\n\r\nyay -Sy snapd\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n每当你 更新 Arch Linux 系统时，yay 都会启用 snapd 的自动更新。\n\r\n验证 Snap 支持是否有效\n\r\n要测试 Snap 支持是否正常工作，请安装并运行 hello-world Snap 包。\n\r\nsudo snap install hello-world\r\n\r\nhello-world\r\n（或者）\r\nsudo snap run hello-world\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n如果它运行良好，那么你可以轻松安装其他 Snap 包。\n\r\n方法 2、从 AUR 手动构建 snapd 包\n\r\n如果你不想使用 AUR 助手，你仍然可以从 AUR 获取 snapd。让我展示详细的过程。\n\r\n你需要先安装一些构建工具。\n\r\nsudo pacman -Sy git go go-tools python-docutils\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n完成依赖项安装后，现在可以克隆 snapd 的 AUR 目录，如下所示：\n\r\ngit clone https://aur.archlinux.org/snapd\r\n\r\ncd snapd\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n然后构建 snapd 包：\n\r\nmakepkg -si\r\n\n\r\n当它要求安装其他依赖包时输入 yes。\n\r\n\n\r\n你已安装 snapd 守护程序。但是，需要启用它以在启动时自动启动。\n\r\nsudo systemctl enable snapd --now\r\n\r\nsudo systemctl enable snapd.apparmor --now #start snap applications\r\n\r\nsudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap #optional: classic snap support\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n手动构建包的主要缺点是每次新更新启动时你都必须手动构建。使用 AUR 助手为我们解决了这个问题。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n我更喜欢 Arch Linux 中的 pacman 和 AUR。很少能看到不在 AUR 中但以其他格式提供的应用。尽管如此，在某些你希望直接从源获取它的情况下，使用 Snap 可能是有利的，例如 在 Arch 上安装 Spotify。\n\r\n希望本教程对你有所帮助。如果你有任何问题，请告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/install-snap-arch-linux/\n\r\n作者：Pranav Krishna 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "近几年区块链逐渐火热以后，「去中心化」的概念逐渐受到关注。\n去中心化指的是：在一个分布有众多节点的系统中，每个节点都具有高度自治的特征。\n回想一下，你的各种私有资料都储存在哪里？\n文档都在 WPS 的云盘，或者散落在各种文件夹中；\n音频文件可能分散在网易云音乐、QQ 音乐、酷狗等等音频平台，如果你喜欢音乐的本地化，也许会下载到某个文件夹中；\n至于相片这种更为私人的东西，则有可能在手机本地相册或者选择百度网盘、iCloud 等等网络云盘中。\n我们经常会把同类的文件分散在各处，当我们想去寻找的时候却往往难以在一个确定的地方查询；又或者遭遇到了平台倒闭，难以取回储存在云空间中的珍贵资料。\n所以对于文件的「中心化」储存和管理，是一个值得尝试的文件管理形式。\n我认为其中有三个核心：集中管理、本地优先、在线引用\n将「中心化」概念运用到相册管理中\n比如图片的管理，拿我的个人相册举例。\n我们的手机每天都会有很多图片产生：屏幕截图、自拍、风景等等照片，但并非所有的照片都值得长期保存，所以要定期清理无关照片，备份重要的相片。\n\n我从大学时期就开始使用谷歌相册管理我的手机相片，这个堪称当下功能最强大的在线相册，会智能地自动备份相机拍下的所有照片、屏幕截图，甚至还有其他 APP 中保存的图片。同时也可以一键清理本地已备份的图片，节省手机空间。\n五年多过去了，我的谷歌相册中积攒了无数张相片，其中超过一半以上的图片都是无关的废片，混杂在各种较为重要的照片中，我花了很长时间都难以删除这些图片。\n于是我国庆期间我批量下载了所有的相片，大约 5w 张，其中绝大部分图片都是各种被自动备份的无关照片，经过大约三天的筛选，最终保留下了差不多 7000 多张照片。\n那么问题来了，如何让我的相册不再受到污染，能够自动备份到谷歌相册中，而且我希望能够保留一份相册在本地，在我删除本地照片的时候自动在云端也删除。\n我采取的…",

          "description": "2022国庆七天，秋高气爽良辰美景怎可辜负？驾驶着 Model 3，带上小米 11 Ultra，一路向西北从惠州到桂林。\n\nModel 3 标续版提车于2021 年 12 月，表显续航 423 公里，1.6 万公里后表显降为 418 公里。\n去程全长 627 公里，途径佛山百利达广场特斯拉超充站充电一次约 15 分钟，在贺州境内高速上充电一次约 25 分钟。\n佛山百利达广场特斯拉超充站选址非常好，就在高速出入口附近，上下高速很方便。贺州境内高速上的快充表现不错，功率一度飙到充电 800 km/h 以上。\n\n提车至今对 Model 3 的续航表现基本满意，天气凉爽的情况下表显多少就能跑出多少，甚至有时候实际续航还会超出表显，不同天气状况下的真实续航表现可以看我的 B 站自驾游视频。\n晚霞迎接我们一路向西\n到达桂林市临桂区已是晚上 10 点 15 分左右，办好入住第一件事就是去吃一碗桂林米粉。可能因为去的是商业步行街，美食比较商业化，即使当时比较饿了，这碗粉也没有给我带来美味的感觉。\n\n重头戏在第二天的龙脊梯田之旅。龙脊梯田位于桂林龙胜县东南部和平乡境内的龙脊山。龙脊梯田距龙胜县城27公里，距桂林市80公里，景区面积共66平方公里，梯田分布在海拔300至1100米之间，坡度大多在26至35度之间，最大坡度达50度。\n从临桂区去龙脊梯田景区大门口要一个半小时左右，桂林真大啊，查了下比北京还要大 1 万多平方公里\n根据疫情防控要求，散客只能在景区收费处外面的广场购票，票价 80 元/成年人，和售票处价格一致。\n工作人员告知我们，双向单车道的蜿蜒的山路加上堵车，从景区售票处到龙脊梯田里的几个寨子还要差不多 1 个小时的车程。国庆期间人特别多，如果按常规路线开车去名气最大的大寨，开车到坐缆车的地方要 1 个多小时，排队花钱坐缆车还要1个多小时，工作人员收费给我们指明了一条别的路去千层天梯，美景不打折，还可以开车到达。\n\n工作人员收费指明的这条路应该是尚未完全开发的新路，路上看到了多处没有做固化工程的山坡，不少路段有落石和滑坡泥土，还有一个地方路面塌方，行驶起来要格外小心。\n使用长焦拍下这张照片，脑海里突然响起《断背山》的配乐，给人一种氛围宁静的感觉\n一个多小时后终于达到千层天梯，话不多说欣赏美景吧，看看小米 11 Ultra 记录的龙脊梯田，先来一张全景图。\n\n这张全景图是在千层天梯处拍的，当天天空中飘着淡青蓝色的烟雾，有一种烟雨朦胧的感觉，阳光洒在稻田上勾勒出明暗的分界线，小米 11 Ultra 非常好地还原了真实的色彩和光影。\n当时在梯田附近一家民宿停车吃饭，两荤一素一共三个菜（牛蛙+鱼+青菜+米饭）加免费停车 120 元左右，坐在民宿楼下的台阶上吃饭吹风欣赏美景十分惬意，可以说物超所值。\n\n使用小米 11 Ultra 以来最满意的就是它的长焦表现，镜头压缩空间集中表达内容可以拍出非常有故事感的照片。以下照片应该都是 5x-30x 范围内拍摄的（具体记不清了），画质表现超出预期，当天的良好光线也功不可没。\n 后期调色套了滤镜\n11 Ultra 的主摄表现不错，成片有光影层次，色彩过渡自然，数码味和锐化较少，和肉眼所见十分接近。\n\n当然，小米 11 Ultra 拍照也不是十全十美的，成像慢、多颗摄像头切换动画生硬、逆光自拍效果一般、超级夜景容易糊等等。不过考虑到 3699 元的价格，这些问题也都可以忽略了。\n最后附上一些桂林游玩期间的美图（部分有后期），推荐大家去桂林玩，一座现代和古典，先锋流行和土著闲适相结合的奇妙城市，当地人比较友善，这次去也没遇到宰客行为，花费物超所值，值得一去。",

          "description": "灵动岛是今年iPhone的热点更新。我们在早期的时候，看到了很多针对灵动岛的玩法，比如在岛的周围养宠物、用灵动岛打游戏、适配灵动岛的挖孔壁纸等。\n但是，这些玩法从系统和功能层面，并没有用到真正的“灵动岛接口”。在苹果开发者文档中，灵动岛实际上是一种“实时活动”。在某些用户需要实时关注状态变化的场景下，为用户展示信息。比如实时更新比赛数据、实时更新外卖进度、实时更新计时器、实时更新地图导航指引等等。\n如果iPhone安装了iOS 16.1系统，在iPhone 14 Pro机型上，实时活动可以在灵动岛和锁屏界面展示；而在非iPhone 14 Pro机型，则只在锁屏界面展示。\n\nOneWidget如何定位灵动岛？\n仔细阅读苹果开发者文档之后，我们发现实时活动的实现方式和小组件有非常多重叠的地方。同时，不管在锁屏界面还是“展开的”灵动岛位置，它的尺寸都很像中尺寸的桌面小组件。再者，实时活动不能够交互、也不能有动画、不能随时刷新，这些和小组件都太像了。所以，我们最终把实时活动定位成“一种特殊的小组件”。\n当我们把“灵动岛”定义为“实时展示的小组件”，那么一切就更简单了，原则上小组件能够实现的它都可以实现。只是我们需要额外思考，在锁屏和灵动岛这两个特殊的位置，用户凭什么要展开来用它。\nOneWidget怎么做灵动岛功能？\n在迭代产品的2年多时间里，OneWidget的各种类型的小组件从用户那里得到了很多不错的回馈。当我们复盘这些小组件，用户最关心的是三个关键词：实用、美观、趣味。所以，设计灵动岛这个特殊的小组件，我们应该做的也是实用、美观、趣味。另外补充一点，对于很多用户来说，美观、趣味也是一种实用价值，美观带来个性化的装饰、趣味带来功能的尝鲜探索。\n从实用和便捷角度，我们设计了“启动之岛”和“健康之岛”。\n从美观和趣味角度，我们设计了“宠物之岛”和“摆烂之岛”。\n\n如何开启灵动岛？\n如果iPhone更新到iOS 16.1以上，下载OneWidget 的3.6.0以上的版本之后，可以进入个人中心找到主入口。在灵动岛配置页面，选择需要开启的“岛屿”，当App进入后台或者切换到其他App，实时活动就已经开启在了锁屏界面和灵动岛区域。\n配置入口我们还单独设计了一些细节：会动的海平面、开启后的彩色提示框、预览效果等。\n\n宠物之岛\n用户可以在“宠物之岛”领养一个自己的电子宠物，它每天陪你玩、会饿、会困、会渴，在不同的状态下用户需要点击不同的操作。我们给宠物取了一个名字叫做“岛岛”，领养之后，在App内还会显示领养的天数。岛岛除了不同的状态，也有可能会出去玩耍，只有等他回来才能再次跟他互动。为了满足个性化，宠物“岛岛”还允许自定义颜色，现在我们支持了7种颜色的切换。\n\n启动之岛\n“启动之岛”可以允许用户添加快速启动App或者小程序的入口，常驻在锁屏界面和灵动岛里，展开之后即可点击一键直达的App。用户可以添加1~6的常用启动入口，根据添加的数量变化，图标和间距会自动调整来适应合适的布局。和锁屏小组件、桌面小组件一行，这里的启动器入口支持添加常用的App、微信支付宝的二级路径、微信和支付宝的小程序入口。\n\n摆烂之岛\n“摆烂之岛”将随机展示一些“反鸡汤”的插画和文案。这个功能为了满足“趣味性”，该卷的时候卷，该躺的时候也要好好躺。偶尔摆烂无可厚非，休息是人之常情。\n\n健康之岛\n“健康之岛”实时展示用户当天的健康数据，比如步数、运动时间、消耗能量、身高、体重等。尤其是对于每日会更新变动的数据，是可以查看更新数据的（不过目前系统刷新问题，会有较多延迟）。\n\n \n以上就是OneWidget关于灵动岛功能的思考和功能的介绍。希望帮助大家了解灵动岛，也能够帮助大家通过这些小功能体验到灵动岛（实时活动）的用法。我们将继续做好一个“装修产品”，带来更多实用、美观、有趣的功能。\n回见。",

          "description": "1年多前，由于工作原因，主力开发机换成了 Windows，还入了 Office 365 全家桶。于是在时隔多年后，再次用起了 OneNote。不得不说，都2022年了，OneNote 的码字体验还停留在十多年前，一堆大大小小的遗留问题。但我实在懒得折腾什么 Notion、 Obsidian（没有复杂的知识管理需求），只想找个本地/靠谱/大厂出品/开箱即用的笔记软件，简单记录下工作相关内容。 毕竟人一旦习惯了 markdown 的符号 # 和 -，就真的回不去了。于是研究了下 OneNote 的 api，决定自己动手，丰衣足食。OneMark 由此诞生。\n实时渲染\n废话不多说，直接上动图。\n\n简单来说，OneMark 实现了基于行的实时渲染，每次按回车时会触发渲染当前行。当然，这个实时 跟新世代编辑器字符级别的没法比，但已经足够好用了。\n不仅如此，终于在 OneNote 上实现了可用级别的代码高亮，输入```创建代码块后，每敲一行自动着色。用过 OneNote 的都懂，之前插入代码需要诸多操作，繁琐到想摔键盘。\n\n以及 LaTex 转换到 OneNote 原生的数学公式（不是图片）。\n\n除此之外，还支持TOC / todo / 水平线 / 脚注 等常见的语法，直接拿已有的 markdown 内容粘贴到 OneNote 中， 然后按 F5 渲染，大概率是可以完美还原的。\n\n \n没有美美的样式主题，怎么能算一个合格的笔记软件呢？众所周知，OneNote 本身的样式功能十分鸡肋，用户很难自定义主题，只能默默忍受一成不变的素面朝天。于是我花了好大力气，实现了解析 css 样式的功能，从此 OneNote 的笔记颜值终于能打了。\n\n双向编辑\n你可能会问：这种转换是单向的吗？我如果有一天想导出 markdown 纯文本怎么办？在我看来，原始 markdown 丢失是绝对不能接受的，所以我花了很大力气来解决这个问题：笔记中每个段落的 markdown 原文都以某种格式隐藏存储在自身之中，可以随时读取，不依赖外部文件，任意编辑也不会破坏。而且这种格式是公开透明的，只需要用 OneNote api 拿到 XML 格式的笔记内容，所有秘密一览无余。\n更重要的是，渲染后的内容可以原地随意增删修改，不必再重新切换回 markdown 形态编辑； 而且在导出 markdown 时，内容也会相应更新——是的，实现了双向更新。当然，如果由于某些原因，你想切换回 markdown 形态编辑，也是支持的。按 ctrl + , ，即可在编辑和预览之间切换。\n\n结语\nOneMark 目前只支持 OneNote Windows 桌面版，不支持 UWP 版本以及 Mac 版本（好消息是微软正着手将 UWP 版本的功能迁移到桌面版，以后会只保留桌面版，最近的更新频率也让广大 OneNote 使用者倍感惊喜）。官网 https://onemark.neuxlab.cn/， 欢迎大家试用反馈。\n后记：我为什么选择 OneNote\n有人会问：不是有很多专业的 markdown 笔记软件吗，为什么还要用 OneNote？\n我个人的感悟是：我首先需要的是一个自由轻松的笔记软件，其次是 markdown。我是一个懒人，无论是日常生活，还是工作学习，都没有那么 organized，十分不擅长把东西整理并保持得井井有条。我的笔记中，有一些认真记录和思考产出的内容，但更多时候，是很随意、很碎片、很当下的信息记录。我试过，当面对一个专业的 markdown 笔记软件时，我会变得十分紧张不自在，不知道该把这些零碎、混乱的信息放到哪里。一旦产生了这种情绪，想要记录的念头也随即不了了之。\n而 OneNote 简单直接的界面、清晰的笔记结构、自由的无限画布，让我使用起来没有任何心理压力。唯一的缺点就是当需要认真输出内容时，没有 markdown 这件趁手的兵器，确实有点力不从心。补齐了这点之后，对于我个人而言就别无他求了。\n其实十多年前，OneNote 刚推出的时候也曾惊艳四座， 那时的设计理念和体验还是很超前的，有了现在流行的 block level 编辑器的雏形，无论是列表、段落、表格，书写和调整起来都非常得心应手。也多亏了这些设计，结合 markdown 之后居然毫不违和，整体体验下来有点现代编辑器的味道了。个中玄妙，就待各位亲自上手把玩了。",

In the past, offering efficient, standardized systems was the way to reduce costs and provide more to the public. In today's rapidly changing world, that's not enough. Collaborating, deciding, and executing quickly on a project requires that the traditional organization chart change to strengthen adaptability, transparency, collaboration, inclusivity, and project community—all five Open Organization Principles.

          "description": "https://tordess.com/. \n\nWe are crypto's first prop-trade platform (following business model of ftmo.com and topstep.com, originally for forex & stocks). Our vision is to become a leading crypto social trading platform that offers both prop-trade challenge and copy-trade (twisting Etoro's business model by combining prop-trade + copy-trade to fit the volatility of crypto markets).\n\nThe problem?\nThere is a huge demand for social trading (similar to Etoro) from crypto traders. However, due to the volatile nature of crypto markets, crypto social trading platforms that blindly follow Etoro model do not work. Most copiers there do not gain sustainable profit by copying the top traders but are exposed to significant drawdown risk. \n\nWhy Tordess?\nCombining prop-trade challenges and copy-trade functions can solve the above problem. Being the first prop-trade + copy-trade platform for crypto, we are combining 2 proven business models in stock & forex trading, apply into crypto trading with the aim to disrupt the status quo in its social trading segment. \n\nOur progress?\nWe launched our MVP (open-beta) on October 15th, acquired close to 200 beta users/testers as of today and secured affiliate partnership with 2 major Vietnamese crypto trading & prop-trade (Facebook) groups that have more than 200 thousands members.\n\nWhat we are asking for?\nFeedback, advice, thoughts, comments, anything that helps us serve crypto traders better.\nJoin our free monthly competition to try it out. A good number of skilled crypto day-traders are fighting for the top 3 spots in the leaderboard.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

Simply put in the settings and the server you are accessing has no way of knowing who is accessing it. (At network level.) It is based on the Tor protocol, the most well-known method of routing cloaking, and further improves ease of use and portability.  Portability is the ease with which the execution environment can be moved from one to another, in other words, the ease of execution. In Negy, all components are containerised, so basically one command is all that is needed to launch all components. For example, it is even possible to reproduce Negy's full network in your local pc using the command docker-compose. Portability is very important in the long term, as it contributes to the ease of joining the network and ease of development. In addition, Negy is written in Rust, a memory-safe programming language, so unexpected runtime errors and memory vulnerabilities are essentially non-existent.\n\n🐞 Conclusion\nWe have a roadmap that we create a world where nobody has to worry about routing. Thanks for supporting us!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "@sam_safer_valentine, @steven_layne and I helped build an online community called Mainstream. When the site took off, we found ourselves scrambling to keep up – stitching together dozens of marketing, messaging, and analytics tools and writing code as fast as we could to make it all work together. We started collaborating with other creator businesses and community-driven brands and quickly realized we were all dealing with the same problems:\n- Good tools are expensive\n- Workflows are fragmented\n- It’s hard to get started and even harder to grow\n\nWe met incredible founders, makers, and creative entrepreneurs with skills and vision, but who didn’t have the toolkit or know-how to grow a modern, multi-channel brand. So we built Norby to help fill that gap with:\n- Easy-to-use SMS and email marketing tools\n- Customizable landing pages for signups, events, and your link in bio\n- Plug-and-play segmentation and cross-platform analytics\n- Resources and community to help you at every stage of your journey\n\nOur goal is to help you grow — whether you’re just getting started or building on your success. Launching a Shopify shop? Grow your lists by organizing community events. Releasing an album? Build hype with SMS drops. Scaling your coaching business? Streamline your signups and workshop management.\n\nWe’ve built Norby from the ground up to help you find sustainable success, and that includes our business model. We don’t charge by the contact or follower, we don’t make money from ads, and we don’t sell your data – ever. Our Growth plan is $19/mo and you can try it for free, no credit card required, by clicking the link above. (And if you sign up now, you'll lock in 50% off your first month as a special thank you from our team 🙂)\n\nCheck it out and drop a comment below. We’d love to hear your feedback, thoughts on features we should add next, or how you’re thinking about community-driven growth!\n\nNick\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "mirrord. mirrord lets you run your local process in the context of your Kubernetes cluster, unlocking a new development workflow: rather than waiting for long deployments and CI iterations, your code can now meet the cloud just as soon as it’s written.\n\nTo use it, you can download the CLI tool (we also have IDE extensions) and run this:\n\nmirrord exec -–target pod/app-pod-12345 node app.js\n\nYour local process (\"node app.js\" in this example) is now connected to the pod app-pod-12345 in your Kubernetes cluster. Here’s what this means:\n\n- Incoming traffic to the pod is mirrored to your local process\n- Outgoing traffic from your local process is tunnelled through the pod, using the remote pod’s DNS\n- Environment variables from the pod are imported to your local process\n- File access from your local process is proxied to the pod\n\nIn other words, all input and output is now proxied to the cloud, and your process “thinks” it’s running in your Kubernetes cluster. \n\nmirrord is free and self-serve, and we'd love for you to give it a try and hear what you think! You can get started here or on GitHub\n\n\nAviram\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
