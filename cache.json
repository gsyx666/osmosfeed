          "description": "It might seem strange use a new Python web framework over an older, more mature framework, but in this article I will tell you why you should. Waffleweb is, you guessed it, a Python web framework. Waffleweb was released on the 15th of July 2022, while Flask was released on April the 1st 2010. As you can see Flask is a lot older.\nIf you want certain features in a web framework, but you don't want to go through all the trouble of creating all the other things needed for a web framework, you can just add features to Waffleweb. Since Waffleweb is in alpha changes and new features a welcome and wanted.\nIn Flask new features will have to go through stages of checks before it can get through, and it might not get through.\nSince Waffleweb is newer, less people have worked on the code meaning that it is a little bit cleaner. Waffleweb is also pretty bare-bones right, so there is little clutter. The simpler codebase also means that it is easier to modify.\nFlask has a bigger codebase meaning it is harder to work on since you will have to go through several layers of abstraction. It is also harder to get a full understanding of what everything does.\nSince there are no tutorials on Waffleweb (other than the docs), There is lots of space to create new tutorials. There are also no known \"Masters\" of Waffleweb, so you could be the first! \nFlask has many many tutorials around the internet, which is good, but it also means that if you create a tutorial, there is a smaller chance for them to be seen. One downside of Waffleweb is that it doesn't have many tutorials, meaning for some people it might be harder to learn.\nIn summary, there are many reasons to use Waffleweb over Flask. You can add features easily to it, and there is a smaller codebase. These reasons are also applicable to other frameworks and libraries. Tell me what you think in the comments!",

          "description": "开源是一个具有挑战性的概念。许多人认为，开源意味着可以任意的使用软件，并且可以免费下载。这实际上取决于你如何被许可 —— 开发者分享代码时使用的许可证决定了它。开源软件可以是收费的，也可以限制你如何去使用它，在极少数情况下，甚至让你陷入法律纠纷。\n\r\nFedora 项目最近决定拒绝所有使用 知识共享Creative Commons “公共领域专用” CC0 许可证的代码，以避免这种情况的出现。CC0 将从新提交代码中准许使用的许可证列表中剔除，但是，像艺术品一类的贡献仍被允许所以它，甚至可能在个案的情况下对当前的软件包进行逐一的处理。\n\r\n如果 Fedora 反对一个软件许可证，通常不会成为新闻。事实上，在那么多的许可证当中，该项目拒绝了许多许可证。这种情况的意外之处在于，CC0 最初被认为是一个有效的许可证，现在只是由于更大的自由及开源（FOSS）社区内的观点转变而被重新分类。\n\r\nCC0 是因为什么让 Fedora 决定停止支持它，这又是否意味着你不能在你自己的项目中使用它呢？\n\r\n这一段描述让最熟悉知识共享及其许可系列的人惊讶的是，Fedora 最初批准了 CC0 的软件。毕竟，知识共享从一开始的目标是为艺术作品提供一系列明确的许可证。该组织的使命和许可证的要求在其名称“知识共享”中就有所体现。\n\r\n为了“克服分享信息和创造力的法律障碍”，提供一个自由的框架来为人们组织分享如音乐、医学或教育材料的资源，知识共享组织的前身——开放内容项目Open Content Project，于 2001 年成立。然而，软件从来不是它的组成要素。为什么呢？因为那时，如 MIT、GPL 一类的重要的软件许可证已经出现了十几年。\n\r\n很明显，如果一家公司不遗余力地警告你他们制造的东西不适合某种特定用途，你也许应该相信他们。知识共享的 FAQ 列出了一些反对在软件上使用他们的许可证的令人信服的论据，但对于像 Fedora 项目这样的用户来说，其中一个问题特别突出：专利权。\n\r\n鉴于 CC0 许可证是为公共领域的作品准备的，而且通过使用它，创作者明确地“放弃了他或她在版权法下对作品的所有权利”，这似乎矛盾的。但是，问题在于，版权法并不适用于专利。事实上，仔细审视许可证的完整措辞后可以发现，它在一个令人担忧的部分解决了这个问题，该部分内容如下：“宣告者拥有的任何商标或专利权都没有被本文本放弃、抛弃、交出、租赁或以其他方式修改。”\n\r\n换言之，即使被 CC0 许可的东西的作者可能愿意放弃对它的权力，但他们仍然可以自由的为它申请专利。更糟糕的是，他们仍然保留着以他们认为合适的方式使用该专利的能力。\n\r\n理论上来说，这意味着最初在 CC0 下提供的源代码的人在发布了代码之后，他们可能会在之后断言任何使用该代码的人侵犯了他们的专利，并要求支付专利费。\n\r\n这显然会让像 Fedora 这样的项目担忧。考虑一下这样的情形：CC0 许可的代码进入到一个系统的核心，然后被提供给数以百万计的用户。突然间，不知道从哪里冒出来的原创作者，声称侵犯了专利权，并要求付款。红帽或 Fedora 的律师可以驳倒这种说法么？也许吧。那么，为了查明真相而使用 CC0 代码值得么？不值得。\n\r\n要着重提到的是，这完全不是一个新问题。实际上，早在 2012 年，专利条款就阻止了开源倡议（OSI）许可证的审查委员会，他们无法最终确定 CC0 是否真正符合他们对开源许可证的定义。委员会未能达成一致意见，因为其成员认为将此类条款纳入软件许可将创造一个危险的先例。考虑到 Fedora 动荡的历史，它最初接受 CC0 的决定着实让人费解。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/08/what-made-fedora-choose-to-use-cc0-licensed-code-as-the-boot/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：yjacks 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "遵循几个简单的步骤来保持 Git 仓库的整洁\n\r\n\r\n在合并一个 GibLab 的合并请求（MR）或 GitHub 的拉取请求（PR）后，你通常需要从远程仓库中删掉这个主题分支来保持仓库的整洁。然而，这只会删掉远程仓库的主题分支。本地 Git 仓库也会从例行清理中收益。\n\r\n要同步本地仓库和远程仓库的信息，可以执行 git prune 命令来删除本地仓库中远程分支的本地引用。\n\r\n按照以下三个简单的步骤：\n\r\n1、检出仓库中的核心分支（比如 main 或者 master）：\n\r\n$ git checkout <central_branch_name>\r\n\n\r\n2、列出所有远程和本地分支：\n\r\n$ git branch -a\r\n\n\r\n示例输出：\n\r\n4.10.z\r\n* master\r\n  remotes/mydata/4.9-stage\r\n  remotes/mydata/4.9.z\r\n  remotes/mydata/test-branch\r\n\n\r\n在这个例子中，test-branch 是从远程仓库中删除的主题分支的名字。\n\r\n3、删除远程分支的本地引用：\n\r\n首先，列出所有可以从本地仓库中删除的分支：\n\r\n$ git remote prune origin --dry-run\r\n\n\r\n示例输出：\n\r\nPruning origin\r\nURL: git@example.com:myorg/mydata-4.10.git\r\n* [would prune] origin/test-branch\r\n\n\r\n然后，删除远程分支的本地引用：\n\r\n$ git remote prune origin\r\n\n\r\n示例输出：\n\r\nPruning origin\r\nURL: git@example.com:myorg/mydata-4.10.git\r\n* [pruned] origin/test-branch\r\n\n\r\n就是这样！\n\r\n维护 Git 仓库\n\r\n保持 Git 仓库的整洁，一开始似乎并不紧急，但是随着仓库规模的增长，删除不必要的数据就变得更为重要。不要让从无用的数据筛选而拖慢你。\n\r\n经常删除远程分支的本地引用，是维护一个可用的 Git 仓库是一个好方法。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/8/delete-local-reference-remote-branch-git\n\r\n作者：Agil Antony 选题：lkxed 译者：Yufei-Yan 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "我们经常交替使用人工智能（AI）、机器学习（ML）和深度学习（DL）这些术语，尽管我们几乎每天都阅读或听到它们。本文解释了这些技术是如何演变的以及它们有何不同。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n人工智能Artificial Intelligence（AI）、机器学习Machine Learning（ML）和深度学习Deep Learning（DL）通常可以互换使用。但是，它们并不完全相同。人工智能是最广泛的概念，它赋予机器模仿人类行为的能力。机器学习是将人工智能应用到系统或机器中，帮助其自我学习和不断改进。最后，深度学习使用复杂的算法和深度神经网络来重复训练特定的模型或模式。\n\r\n让我们看看每个术语的演变和历程，以更好地理解人工智能、机器学习和深度学习实际指的是什么。\n\r\n人工智能\n\r\n自过去 70 多年以来，人工智能已经取得了长足的进步。无论我们是否知道，也不管喜欢与否，，它已经渗透到了我们生活的方方面面。在过去十年中，机器学习和深度学习的进步已经在各种规模的行业和组织中创造了人工智能热潮。云服务提供商通过开发免费的开源服务和提供新的场景进一步推动的这种势头。\n\r\n\n\r\n人工智能可能是自 1956 年以来最受关注的概念。到 2015 年，GPU 的广泛使用使并行处理更快、更强大、更便宜。而愈加廉价的存储可以大规模地存储大数据（从纯文本到图像、映射等）。这产生了对数据分析的需求，它被更普遍地称为数据科学data science，导致机器学习发展为实现人工智能的方法。\n\r\n机器学习\n\r\n机器学习是使用算法来处理、学习和理解或预测可用数据的模式。最近，软件开发的低代码和无代码概念被用作机器学习中的自学习过程，它给出了完成特定任务的特定指令。通过使用数据和算法对机器进行“训练”，使其能够学习如何执行任务，更重要的是，将学习应用到不断发展的过程中。\n\r\n\n\r\n机器学习是在开发者社区专注于 AI 时发展起来的，然后发展了算法决策树学习、逻辑编程、聚类、并行处理和强化学习。这些都是朝着正确方向迈出的良好一步，但不足以解决世界感兴趣的场景。\n\r\n深度学习\n\r\n深度学习是神经网络和机器学习的进化，是人工智能社区的创意。它学习了人类思维在特定场景中的工作方式，然后在这项工作上比人类做得更好！例如，IBM 的 Watson 与自己下国际象棋，并在游戏中取得了很大进步，最终击败了世界冠军。谷歌的 AlphaGo 也学会了如何玩围棋游戏，一遍又一遍地玩它以提高自己，并成为冠军。\n\r\n人工智能、机器学习和深度学习正在不断发展。参与数据科学的每个人都希望推进这些概念以改善我们的日常生活。而开源社区、私营企业、科学家和政府机构都在为此共同努力。\n\r\n\n\r\n总而言之，虽然 AI 有助于创建智能机器，但机器学习有助于构建 AI 驱动的应用。深度学习是机器学习的一个子集。它通过利用复杂算法处理大量数据来训练特定模型。由于狭义 AI 极难开发，机器学习正在通过刚性计算解决这一领域的机遇。至少对于实现通用 AI，深度学习有助于将 AI 和机器学习结合在一起。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/08/ai-ml-and-dl-whats-the-difference/\n\r\n作者：Bala Kalavala 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "经济独立后，我很快发现自己之前的消费方式需要调整。\n我之前买东西几乎没有计划，大部分是偶发性的，也有很多冲动购买。其次，我对价格有些不敏感，总觉得平台上是这个价格那就这样吧；对很多产品的质量也没有概念，常常不知道该从何判断。比如买水果，我都是让商家随机装一些就过秤拿走。我也很少考虑买东西之后的处置行为，比如多久该把东西淘汰，日用品一般要屯多久等等。\n我逐渐觉得，我应该花些心思调整自己的生活和消费——我需要一个能让我在「重复购买」「快速更迭」的商品上省钱，可以为生活长远算计的在线平台。1688 就这样进入了我的视野。\n1688 建立的初衷是为批发商或者商户找到合适的生产商，由于平台允许商户购买样品，所以个人消费者也可以在 1688 上进行购买。在 1688 平台进行了大半年采买后，我想和大家分享一下我的购物体验和购物感受，也欢迎各位朋友分享你的「批发」心得。\n本文分享的所有产品和卖家均是来自于自己及朋友购买经历，不含有任何广告或者宣传。\n在 1688 购物的原因\n在 1688 购物主要就是为了两方面：规划预算省钱，适量囤货日用。1688 正好在这两点都是强项。\n各大社交平台都有博主提过，同款的产品，其他购物平台基本价格一致，而 1688 上可以便宜一半甚至是更多。因为 1688 上的卖方是生产商，少了很多分销渠道的成本和加价。这也是为什么 1688 会有很多东西便宜到让人惊讶的原因，毕竟「要批发，上 1688」。\n举个例子，我在南方经常要用的除湿袋，在 1688 上的价格是 0.7 元一包，购买超过 250 包，会便宜到 0.68 元。而在当地超市买到的同款至少一包 2 元，有些网购平台甚至要 5 元一包。\n这是我楼下超市卖的同款，非常好用，五块钱一包。\n偶尔一包可能价格差距不大，但这种除湿袋我每年都会用掉很多，累计起来就不在少数了，带上全寝室批发则开销更大。类似的还有袜子、…",

          "description": "「记录」这件事就是非常有威力，它会把注意力之外的小细节收集起来，给予一种确实发生但又意料之外的生活视角。比如如果不是记账，我不知道原来每个月会支出那么多零零碎碎的「拿铁因子」；如果不是 HiWater，我也不会知道原来自己摄入那么多含糖饮料。\n其实我很早之前就购买过 WaterMinder 这款 App Store Editors's Choice 应用，只是彼时的我并不明白「多喝水」三个字对身体的意义，同时也觉得记录喝水这件事就像是记账——没有外部约束、「记录多少全凭诚实美德」的记录只在于自我娱乐。所以往往三天后意兴阑珊删除了事。\nHiWater 则是好友 @特伦 推荐的，把玩了下觉得还不错，但当时并不想为这个需求掏钱；不久前确诊痛风后，离开诊室满心灰暗的我有了「每天喝水 3L+」的刚需，这才发现这款应用的每一个付费点都值得我掏钱。\n作为一款国产应用，HiWater 的饮品目录预设种类都比较契合日常，并且在目录处还醒目地标注了每 100 毫升所带有的千卡热量。向下翻阅到高热量饮品时甚至有一种黑名单的既视感。\n\n如此设计的部分原因是，HiWater 采用了「饮水金字塔」模型，它将所有饮品归在六个等级内，并依此建议每日摄入的比例。此模型虽有哈佛大学公共卫生学院专家的背书，总体指导思想依然是鼓励大家多喝白水，减少摄入高糖、甚至是含糖饮料。\n关联阅读：如何合理控制糖分摄入\n\n对喝水提醒应用来说，我们一般会面临预设饮品难以覆盖真实世界情况的问题。\n所以在 HiWater 中我们也可以新增或编辑饮品类目到「饮水金字塔」模型中，把某个模糊的品类变成精确的单品。比如说 HiWater 预设了椰子水这个饮品，但我日常喝得比较多的是山姆椰子水，那我就直接编辑成山姆椰子水的营养成分，并重新归类到低卡饮料分类中去；再比如我喝的柠檬水是浓缩液和水 1:10 冲兑而来，因此我也通过计算将预设的「柠檬水」编辑成「自制柠檬水」，并由浓缩液计算出对应的热量。\n当然，手动编辑多了我们自然就会想：这些外包装上带有营养成分表的商品饮料，如何快捷记录到应用内？\nHiWater 的答案是「直接用相机扫」，请直接看这个动图：\n\n我猜测可能 Apple 在系统中给了 OCR 相关的 API，开发者就取来做这个功能了。这是我最喜欢的功能，实际使用起来识别比动图中要更迅速，识别率高且稳定。偶尔可能会有一些识别错误，比如把 ≥ 识别成 2，但我也能原谅。\n如此一来，在机场购买的农夫山泉力量帝柠檬水、屯了两箱的兰芳园低糖冻柠茶，都可以统统扫入我的饮品目录。记录时也可以根据自己的实际情况调整，比如冻柠茶虽是低糖，我还是会将它兑冰水或柠檬水喝，因此我的喝水记录里经常会出现 50 毫升的冻柠茶、紧接着出现 200 毫升的水或柠檬水。\n\n之前做手冲咖啡用的秤，现在大多被我用于称水喝，但后续我发现只要记住水倒在杯子上的花纹位置，不用秤也能大致知道这杯水的量。以名创优品的 580 毫升容积的可乐杯为例，杯内两道凹痕，分别可以粗略看作是 200/500 毫升的刻度。在公司喝水，可以考虑在工位启用大杯子装水，之前因为杯子小+次数少，上班时喝水太少。一周下来，确实每日喝水 3.3L 以上。\n\n其余的基础功能，诸如弹出提醒用户喝水、身体水分的简单预估、根据用户情况估算需要摄入的水量等，我就不一一展开了，WaterMinder 也有，我认为这些是一款「喝水类」App 都应该做的免费功能。其实我原先也是想通过快捷指令自己做一个提醒和记录每日喝水的应用，这不难，我甚至已经做好了 社死版快捷指令 定时运行，但体验过 HiWater 的一些交互后，我最后决定不折腾自己了。\n应用内还有不少花心思的交互和设计\nHiWater 多样的桌面小组件，还支出快捷录入饮品，打破了我对 iOS 小组件「能看不能用」的固有认知（我原先在 iOS 上并不使用任何 Widget，这一下就微上瘾了，顺带一口气添加了其余应用的小组件 xD）。\n精美的 Widget，支持快捷录入\nHiWater 采用免费下载+内购解锁的付费机制，如果你看完文章对它感兴趣，安装来把玩把玩也可以。如果想要为它付费的话，建议先确认自己有强烈的督促自己喝水的需求，然后订阅一个月试试——我直接买断是因为意识到「多喝水」这样的生活我可能要持续好几个月，甚至好几年，本身并不是很理性的消费习惯。\n如果一个应用能够帮助我长期维持某个健康习惯，我愿意给出「十刀买断，天大划算」的评价；如果没有，我也会用「三分钟热度三分钟收获」来安慰自己。\n> 下载 少数派 2.0 客户端、关注 少数派公众号，解锁全新阅读体验 📰\n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀",

The pardon will be formalized on August 15th.\nThe presidential pardon is reminiscent of the two given to Lee’s father, Lee Kun-hee, who was convicted of corruption and tax evasion in 1996 and 2008. \n\n\n“In a bid to overcome the economic crisis by revitalizing the economy, Samsung Electronics vice-chairman Lee Jae-yong, whose suspended prison term ended recently, will be reinstated,” the South Korean government said in a statement reported by the Financial Times.\nThe pardon is the latest turn in a...\nContinue reading…",
