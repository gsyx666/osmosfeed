It's not rare that a small change leads to 2 or 3 minutes of compilation to test the change, which frustrates a lot of new rustaceans. It's a deliberate choice made by the language designers to favor runtime speed over compilation speed (it's why we love Rust: raw speed), and there is no magic incantation or cheat code to reduce this compilation time.\nIt took me some time to find a good workflow, which does not break my flow state (when I'm in the zone), so I thought it was worth sharing if it can save you time, dear reader.\nBut first, I have a question: What makes you happier, swimming against the current or embracing the flow and getting things done?\nIf you come from programming languages such as TypeScript or Go,…",

It uses decorators like Angular does (for the compiler to collect metadata and generate the output code based on that), and jsx/tsx with lifecycles just like React. It is a very powerfool tool to generate design systems.\nIn this design system that I've been working on, there was the problem of how to store the global state.

          "description": "谷歌和苹果的短信标准对抗再次升级\n\r\niPhone 的短信应用 iMessage 不支持现代的 RCS 标准，因此，从 iPhone 发往安卓的短信只能采用古老的 SMS 标准。RCS 是 2008 年推出的旨在取代 SMS 的短信标准，支持更丰富的功能。它和 iMessage 一样，其信息是通过互联网传递，而不是通过电信运营商。为了使 iPhone 也能支持先进的 RCS 规范，安卓不断向苹果施压，甚至专门做了一个页面，上面有一些按钮可以让用户给苹果的 Twitter 发消息敦促它。但是苹果就是一无所动。现在，就像 iPhone 发往安卓的短信一样，当安卓用户用表情符对 iPhone 发来的短信做出回应时，iPhone 用户收到的短信不是显示该表情符，而是对该表情符的文字描述，如“爱心”这样的文字。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Insider\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：说到底，是苹果觉得支持 RCS 对它没好处，而迫使用户都用它的 iPhone。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n开源网络安全监控平台 Zeek 成为 Windows 的一部分\n\r\n发布于 1998 年的 Zeek（最初名为 Bro）正在被整合到 Windows 中，成为微软 Defender 的一部分，“现在已经部署在全球超过 10 亿个端点上。”Zeek 可以将网络流量转化为紧凑和高保真的日志、文件内容和行为分析，以加快安全操作。Zeek 的创始人称，“我从未想过我开发的网络监控工具会在防御端点方面找到更广泛的应用 —— 但这是开源开发的创造性魔法的一部分”。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Corelight\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：微软对采用开源软件方面毫无心理障碍，凡是好的都会想办法拿到 Windows 里面。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n苹果宣布下周起更多广告将进入应用商店\n\r\n苹果宣布从 10 月 25 日开始，在除中国以外的所有国家，与应用程序相关的广告将开始出现在苹果应用商店的主“今日”标签和单个应用程序列表底部的“您可能也喜欢”部分。这是开发者首次能够在“今日”标签上投放广告。“您可能也喜欢”的广告是增加实际“应用税”的另一种手段，迫使开发者在自己的应用页面上购买广告，以避免其他人将客户从自己手上引导走。苹果应用商店的广告以前只限于基于关键词的搜索结果和搜索标签的“建议”部分。苹果希望在未来将其目前的广告收入增加近三倍，达到每年至少 100 亿美元。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：MacRumors\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：所以，就像 WIRED 说的那样，苹果现在是一家广告公司。",

          "description": "你设法在你的 Ubuntu 系统上安装了谷歌 Chrome 浏览器。现在你想知道如何让浏览器保持更新。\n\r\n\r\n在 Windows 和 macOS 上，当 Chrome 上有可用更新时，你会在浏览器中收到通知，你可以从浏览器中点击更新选项。\n\r\nLinux 中的情况有所不同。你不会从浏览器更新 Chrome。你要使用系统更新对其进行更新。\n\r\n是的。当 Chrome 上有可用的新更新时，Ubuntu 会通过系统更新工具通知你。\n\r\n\n\r\n你只需单击“立即安装Install Now”按钮，在被提示时输入你的帐户密码并将 Chrome 更新到新版本。\n\r\n让我告诉你为什么会在系统级别看到更新，以及如何在命令行中更新谷歌 Chrome。\n\r\n方法 1：使用系统更新更新谷歌浏览器\n\r\n你最初是如何安装 Chrome 的？你从 Chrome 网站 获得了 deb 安装程序文件，并使用它来 在 Ubuntu 上安装 Chrome。\n\r\n当你这样做时，谷歌会在你系统的源列表中添加一个仓库条目。这样，你的系统就会信任来自谷歌仓库的包。\n\r\n\n\r\n对于添加到系统中的所有此类条目，包更新通过 Ubuntu 更新程序集中进行。\n\r\n这就是为什么当 Google Chrome（和其他已安装的应用）有可用更新时，你的 Ubuntu 系统会向你发送通知。\n\r\n\n\r\n单击“立即安装Install Now”按钮并在要求时输入你的密码。很快，系统将安装所有可升级的软件包。\n\r\n根据更新偏好，通知可能不是立即的。如果需要，你可以手动运行更新程序工具并查看适用于你的 Ubuntu 系统的更新。\n\r\n\n\r\n方法 2：在 Ubuntu 命令行中更新 Chrome\n\r\n如果你更喜欢终端而不是图形界面，你也可以使用命令更新 Chrome。\n\r\n打开终端，并依次运行以下命令：\n\r\nsudo apt update\r\n\r\nsudo apt --only-upgrade install google-chrome-stable\r\n\n\r\n第一条命令更新包缓存，以便你的系统知道可以升级哪些包。\n\r\n第二条命令 仅更新单个包，即谷歌 Chrome（安装为 google-chrome-stable）。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n如你所见，Ubuntu 比 Windows 更精简。你会随其他系统更新一起更新 Chrome。\n\r\n顺便一提，如果你对它不满意，你可以了解 从 Ubuntu 中删除 Google Chrome。\n\r\nChrome 是一款不错的浏览器。你可以通过 使用 Chrome 中的快捷方式 来试验它，因为它使浏览体验更加流畅。\n\r\n在 Ubuntu 上享受 Chrome！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/update-google-chrome-ubuntu/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Matrix 首页推荐\nMatrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。\n文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。\n\n一年多前，由于工作原因，主力开发机换成了 Windows，还入了 Office 365 全家桶。于是在时隔多年后，再次用起了 OneNote。不得不说，都 2022 年了，OneNote 的码字体验还停留在十多年前，一堆大大小小的遗留问题。但我实在懒得折腾什么 Notion、Obsidian（没有复杂的知识管理需求），只想找个本地/靠谱/大厂出品/开箱即用的笔记软件，简单记录下工作相关内容。 毕竟人一旦习惯了 markdown 的符号 # 和 -，就真的回不去了。于是研究了下 OneNote 的 api，决定自己动手，丰衣足食。OneMark 由此诞生。\n实时渲染\n废话不多说，直接上动图。\n\n简单来说，OneMark 实现了基于行的实时渲染，每次按回车时会触发渲染当前行。当然，这个实时 跟新世代编辑器字符级别的没法比，但已经足够好用了。\n不仅如此，终于在 OneNote 上实现了可用级别的代码高亮，输入``` 创建代码块后，每敲一行自动着色。用过 OneNote 的都懂，之前插入代码需要诸多操作，繁琐到想摔键盘。\n\n以及 LaTex 转换到 OneNote 原生的数学公式（不是图片）。\n\n除此之外，还支持TOC / todo / 水平线 / 脚注 等常见的语法，直接拿已有的 markdown 内容粘贴到 OneNote 中， 然后按 F5 渲染，大概率是可以完美还原的。\n\n \n没有美美的样式主题，怎么能算一个合格的笔记软件呢？众所周知，OneNote 本身的样式功能十分鸡肋，用户很难自定义主题，只能默默忍受一成不变的素面朝天。于是我花了好大力气，实现了解析 css 样式的功能，从此 OneNote 的笔记颜值终于能打了。\n\n双向编辑\n你可能会问：这种转换是单向的吗？我如果有一天想导出 markdown 纯文本怎么办？在我看来，原始 markdown 丢失是绝对不能接受的，所以我花了很大力气来解决这个问题：笔记中每个段落的 markdown 原文都以某种格式隐藏存储在自身之中，可以随时读取，不依赖外部文件，任意编辑也不会破坏。而且这种格式是公开透明的，只需要用 OneNote api 拿到 XML 格式的笔记内容，所有秘密一览无余。\n更重要的是，渲染后的内容可以原地随意增删修改，不必再重新切换回 markdown 形态编辑；而且在导出 markdown 时，内容也会相应更新——是的，实现了双向更新。当然，如果由于某些原因，你想切换回 markdown 形态编辑，也是支持的。按 ctrl + , ，即可在编辑和预览之间切换。\n\n结语\nOneMark 目前只支持 OneNote Windows 桌面版，不支持 UWP 版本以及 Mac 版本（好消息是微软正着手将 UWP 版本的功能迁移到桌面版，以后会只保留桌面版，最近的更新频率也让广大 OneNote 使用者倍感惊喜）。官网 https://onemark.neuxlab.cn/， 欢迎大家试用反馈。\n后记：我为什么选择 OneNote\n有人会问：不是有很多专业的 markdown 笔记软件吗，为什么还要用 OneNote？\n我个人的感悟是：我首先需要的是一个自由轻松的笔记软件，其次是 markdown。我是一个懒人，无论是日常生活，还是工作学习，都没有那么 organized，十分不擅长把东西整理并保持得井井有条。我的笔记中，有一些认真记录和思考产出的内容，但更多时候，是很随意、很碎片、很当下的信息记录。我试过，当面对一个专业的 markdown 笔记软件时，我会变得十分紧张不自在，不知道该把这些零碎、混乱的信息放到哪里。一旦产生了这种情绪，想要记录的念头也随即不了了之。\n而 OneNote 简单直接的界面、清晰的笔记结构、自由的无限画布，让我使用起来没有任何心理压力。唯一的缺点就是当需要认真输出内容时，没有 markdown 这件趁手的兵器，确实有点力不从心。补齐了这点之后，对于我个人而言就别无他求了。\n其实十多年前，OneNote 刚推出的时候也曾惊艳四座， 那时的设计理念和体验还是很超前的，有了现在流行的 block level 编辑器的雏形，无论是列表、段落、表格，书写和调整起来都非常得心应手。也多亏了这些设计，结合 markdown 之后居然毫不违和，整体体验下来有点现代编辑器的味道了。个中玄妙，就待各位亲自上手把玩了。\n> 下载 少数派 2.0 客户端、关注 少数派公众号，解锁全新阅读体验 📰 \n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀",

          "description": "近几年区块链逐渐火热以后，「去中心化」的概念逐渐受到关注。\n去中心化指的是：在一个分布有众多节点的系统中，每个节点都具有高度自治的特征。\n回想一下，你的各种私有资料都储存在哪里？\n文档都在 WPS 的云盘，或者散落在各种文件夹中；\n音频文件可能分散在网易云音乐、QQ 音乐、酷狗等等音频平台，如果你喜欢音乐的本地化，也许会下载到某个文件夹中；\n至于相片这种更为私人的东西，则有可能在手机本地相册或者选择百度网盘、iCloud 等等网络云盘中。\n我们经常会把同类的文件分散在各处，当我们想去寻找的时候却往往难以在一个确定的地方查询；又或者遭遇到了平台倒闭，难以取回储存在云空间中的珍贵资料。\n所以对于文件的「中心化」储存和管理，是一个值得尝试的文件管理形式。\n我认为其中有三个核心：集中管理、本地优先、在线引用\n将「中心化」概念运用到相册管理中\n比如图片的管理，拿我的个人相册举例。\n我们的手机每天都会有很多图片产生：屏幕截图、自拍、风景等等照片，但并非所有的照片都值得长期保存，所以要定期清理无关照片，备份重要的相片。\n\n我从大学时期就开始使用谷歌相册管理我的手机相片，这个堪称当下功能最强大的在线相册，会智能地自动备份相机拍下的所有照片、屏幕截图，甚至还有其他 APP 中保存的图片。同时也可以一键清理本地已备份的图片，节省手机空间。\n五年多过去了，我的谷歌相册中积攒了无数张相片，其中超过一半以上的图片都是无关的废片，混杂在各种较为重要的照片中，我花了很长时间都难以删除这些图片。\n于是我国庆期间我批量下载了所有的相片，大约 5w 张，其中绝大部分图片都是各种被自动备份的无关照片，经过大约三天的筛选，最终保留下了差不多 7000 多张照片。\n那么问题来了，如何让我的相册不再受到污染，能够自动备份到谷歌相册中，而且我希望能够保留一份相册在本地，在我删除本地照片的时候自动在云端也删除。\n我采取的…",

          "description": "灵动岛是今年iPhone的热点更新。我们在早期的时候，看到了很多针对灵动岛的玩法，比如在岛的周围养宠物、用灵动岛打游戏、适配灵动岛的挖孔壁纸等。\n但是，这些玩法从系统和功能层面，并没有用到真正的“灵动岛接口”。在苹果开发者文档中，灵动岛实际上是一种“实时活动”。在某些用户需要实时关注状态变化的场景下，为用户展示信息。比如实时更新比赛数据、实时更新外卖进度、实时更新计时器、实时更新地图导航指引等等。\n如果iPhone安装了iOS 16.1系统，在iPhone 14 Pro机型上，实时活动可以在灵动岛和锁屏界面展示；而在非iPhone 14 Pro机型，则只在锁屏界面展示。\n\nOneWidget如何定位灵动岛？\n仔细阅读苹果开发者文档之后，我们发现实时活动的实现方式和小组件有非常多重叠的地方。同时，不管在锁屏界面还是“展开的”灵动岛位置，它的尺寸都很像中尺寸的桌面小组件。再者，实时活动不能够交互、也不能有动画、不能随时刷新，这些和小组件都太像了。所以，我们最终把实时活动定位成“一种特殊的小组件”。\n当我们把“灵动岛”定义为“实时展示的小组件”，那么一切就更简单了，原则上小组件能够实现的它都可以实现。只是我们需要额外思考，在锁屏和灵动岛这两个特殊的位置，用户凭什么要展开来用它。\nOneWidget怎么做灵动岛功能？\n在迭代产品的2年多时间里，OneWidget的各种类型的小组件从用户那里得到了很多不错的回馈。当我们复盘这些小组件，用户最关心的是三个关键词：实用、美观、趣味。所以，设计灵动岛这个特殊的小组件，我们应该做的也是实用、美观、趣味。另外补充一点，对于很多用户来说，美观、趣味也是一种实用价值，美观带来个性化的装饰、趣味带来功能的尝鲜探索。\n从实用和便捷角度，我们设计了“启动之岛”和“健康之岛”。\n从美观和趣味角度，我们设计了“宠物之岛”和“摆烂之岛”。\n\n如何开启灵动岛？\n如果iPhone更新到iOS 16.1以上，下载OneWidget 的3.6.0以上的版本之后，可以进入个人中心找到主入口。在灵动岛配置页面，选择需要开启的“岛屿”，当App进入后台或者切换到其他App，实时活动就已经开启在了锁屏界面和灵动岛区域。\n配置入口我们还单独设计了一些细节：会动的海平面、开启后的彩色提示框、预览效果等。\n\n宠物之岛\n用户可以在“宠物之岛”领养一个自己的电子宠物，它每天陪你玩、会饿、会困、会渴，在不同的状态下用户需要点击不同的操作。我们给宠物取了一个名字叫做“岛岛”，领养之后，在App内还会显示领养的天数。岛岛除了不同的状态，也有可能会出去玩耍，只有等他回来才能再次跟他互动。为了满足个性化，宠物“岛岛”还允许自定义颜色，现在我们支持了7种颜色的切换。\n\n启动之岛\n“启动之岛”可以允许用户添加快速启动App或者小程序的入口，常驻在锁屏界面和灵动岛里，展开之后即可点击一键直达的App。用户可以添加1~6的常用启动入口，根据添加的数量变化，图标和间距会自动调整来适应合适的布局。和锁屏小组件、桌面小组件一行，这里的启动器入口支持添加常用的App、微信支付宝的二级路径、微信和支付宝的小程序入口。\n\n摆烂之岛\n“摆烂之岛”将随机展示一些“反鸡汤”的插画和文案。这个功能为了满足“趣味性”，该卷的时候卷，该躺的时候也要好好躺。偶尔摆烂无可厚非，休息是人之常情。\n\n健康之岛\n“健康之岛”实时展示用户当天的健康数据，比如步数、运动时间、消耗能量、身高、体重等。尤其是对于每日会更新变动的数据，是可以查看更新数据的（不过目前系统刷新问题，会有较多延迟）。\n\n \n以上就是OneWidget关于灵动岛功能的思考和功能的介绍。希望帮助大家了解灵动岛，也能够帮助大家通过这些小功能体验到灵动岛（实时活动）的用法。我们将继续做好一个“装修产品”，带来更多实用、美观、有趣的功能。\n回见。",
