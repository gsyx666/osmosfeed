I have had a taste of multi national corporates, mid size product companies and startups alike. All these places have had different set of challenges, but there was always a common theme I could see everywhere. Most of these challenges were rarely related to technical complexity. These mostly had developers struggling to understand what they were supposed to produce. The architects, product managers tried hard to be precise, but despite of all the efforts the result wasn't any different.\nLooking at those scenario's in retrospect with a trained brain; a brain that has gotten a little better at finding patterns over time, I found root cause for most of the misery poin…",

They've acquired a lot of traction in recent years, and every major corporation is creating one.\nMicroservices are an innovative and very unique approach to developing application systems as a collection of small services, each performing discrete and well-defined functions and being deployed independently. They are easier to understand, easier to deploy, and can be shared across different systems. This method brings high agility to an application system and provides many opportunities for DevOps and CI/CD.\nIn this article, you are going to learn about:\nMicroservices architecture of application systems\nVarious benefits of building microservices\nMicroservices development tools and technology\nCommon patterns for…",

          "description": "做一个高效的、充满好奇心的问题解决者吧！这会帮助你成为一名成功的程序员。\n\r\n\r\n你是否曾经遇到过这样一种情况：你想解决一个问题，并且你在 YouTube 或 Google 中找到了相关的教程。嗯，你觉得看会了，可真做起来，却止步不前，大脑一片空白。你感觉自己每一行代码都看懂了，可一旦离开了那个教程，就步履维艰。如果你在 HackerRank 或 LeetCode 上看过别人的解题过程，你就能体会到，一个有追求的程序员第一次看到这些挑战时，他会是何种感受。举例来说，假设你正在学习一门新语言，在你刚开始理解这门语言的基础知识的时候，你看了一个教程，摩拳擦掌，结果发现自己无法独立应用学到的知识，这反过来可能会导致你怀疑自己的知识和能力。\n\r\n把教程付诸于实践\n\r\n你应该从头开始吗？如果你这么做，你可能很快就会发现自己重复学习了很多次相同的知识点。虽然从头开始并不一定是种浪费，但是，你该如何变得更高效呢？\n\r\n死记硬背在编程中完全是行不通的。话虽如此，但你也不能够忽视熟悉语法的重要性。因为，死记硬背和养成习惯之间是有明显区别的。习惯是很难打破的。要养成多使用编程语言的常规语法、函数、方法、模式、范式和构造的习惯，这样你才能掌握它。掌握一门编程语言需要大量的创造力和练习。练习语法是非常必要的，直到它们能在你的脑海中自然地浮现，就像血液在血管里流动一样。\n\r\n“问题解决”的工作原理\n\r\n那么，你该采取什么样的方案呢？这实际上取决于许多因素。这些因素可以是任何东西，下至技术限制，上至用户需要。世界上有无数的问题，每个问题都有许多解决方式。如何选择一个最好的？这就需要“问题解决”problem-solving的技巧了。\n\r\n下面是一个简单的例子。你需要把两个数相加，让它们等于 6。显然，你有多种方式可供选择：\n\r\n3 + 3 = 6 或 4 + 2 = 6 或 5 + 1 = 6\n\r\n同理，如果你需要让两个数字，经过一次减法、乘法或除法运算后，得到的结果为 6。你仍然有很多选项，包括：\n\r\n8 - 2 = 6 或 12 / 2 = 6 或 3 * 2 = 6\n\r\n每种方案都有它固有的限制，且各不相同。当你在现实生活中尝试做出一个高效的方案时，你必须要考虑到所有的限制。这个方案可行吗？有什么障碍吗？有可操作性吗？是否可扩展呢？而如何最小化约束，并做出一个最优方案，就取决于问题类型和业务需要。\n\r\n练习很重要\n\r\n编程的目标不仅仅是解决问题。因此，从工程视角理解代码如何工作始终是一个优势。这就是代码审查在企业级开发中发挥作用的地方。编程的最低要求是具备基本的编码知识，包括语言的语法、函数和方法。归根结底，“写代码”是需要你去写的，所以练习总是有助于提高你的技能。流畅的写作和复杂方案的开发都来自于持续的学习和训练。\n\r\n学习编码\n\r\n我撰写和分享这篇文章，是为了鼓励新程序员去探寻自己的内心，寻找那个“优秀的问题解决者”。请不要停止相信自己。\n\r\n要成功编码，你需要培养许多习惯。下面是我在学习编码时保持高效的方法：\n\r\n\r\n一个包含语法、方法和函数 速查手册 总能应付不时之需。\n\r\n将问题分解成更小的部分，便于追踪。\n\r\n尝试理解代码运行的核心概念。\n\r\n构思解决方案时，大可发挥你的创造力 —— 但刚开始还是要注重基础。\n\r\n在练习时，创建尽可能多的应用和组件。\n\r\n永远不要从 Stack Overflow/Exchange 等开放平台上复制/粘贴代码，特别是在不了解上下文的情况下。\n\r\n跟着教程做了一遍后，尝试从头开始构建所有内容。即使你只能独立完成一半，那也仍然是一个成就。\n\r\n\r\n祝我们所有人好运！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/8/coding-advice-new-programmers\n\r\n作者：Sachin Samal 选题：lkxed 译者：lkxed 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "在 2020 年 SolarWinds 网络间谍活动之后，一系列进一步的软件供应链漏洞凸显了确保软件监管链安全的必要性。在这场间谍活动中，俄罗斯黑客渗透到一个广泛使用的 IT 管理平台，并将受污染的升级程序悄悄带入其中。由于开源项目从根本上来说是分散的，而且经常是临时的活动，因此在这种背景下，这个问题尤其紧迫。GitHub 著名的 npm 注册中心广泛使用的 JavaScript 软件包遭到一系列令人不安的黑客攻击后，该公司前不久公布了一项战略，以提供更好的开源安全保护。\n\r\n代码签名平台 Sigstore 将由微软旗下的 GitHub 支持，以用于 npm 软件包。代码签名类似于数字蜡封。为了让开源维护者更加容易地确认他们编写的代码是否与全球范围内人们实际下载的软件包中最终包含的代码相同，跨行业协作促成了该工具的创建。\n\r\nGitHub 并不是开源生态系统的唯一组成部分，但 Sigstore 的联合开发者、Chainguard 的首席执行官 Dan Lorenc 指出，它是社区的一个重要枢纽，因为绝大多数项目都在这里存储和共享源代码。然而，当开发人员真正想下载开源软件或工具时，他们通常会通过软件包管理进行。\n\r\n通过让包管理器可以使用 Sigstore，开发人员可以在 Sigstore 工具的帮助下，在软件通过供应链时处理加密检查和要求。这增加了产品流通过程中每个阶段的透明度。Lorenc 说，许多人在得知这些完整性检查尚未实施时感到震惊，开源生态系统中相当大的一部分长期以来一直依赖于盲目的信心。拜登政府于 2021 年 5 月发布了一项行政命令，主要涉及软件供应链安全问题。\n\r\nLinux 基金会、谷歌、红帽、Purdue Universit 和 Chainguard 都对 Sigstore 的开发做出了贡献。现在有了使用 Sigstore 为 Python 包发行版签名的官方软件，而且开发软件的开源环境 Kubernetes 现在也支持它。\n\r\nSigstore 依靠免费和简单易用来鼓励采用，就像主要行业推动 HTTPS 网络加密一样，这在很大程度上是由非营利组织互联网安全研究组Internet Security Research Group的 Let's Encrypt 等工具实现的。据 GitHub 称，该项目会首先提出 Sigstore 将如何在 npm 中实现的建议，并在开放评论期征求社区人员对该工具的精确部署策略的意见。然而，最终的目标是让这样的代码签名能够被尽可能多的开源项目使用，从而让对供应链的攻击更加困难。\n\r\nGitHub 的 Hutchings 说：“我们希望看到这样一个世界，最终所有的软件工件都被签名并链接回源代码，这就是为什么构建像 Sigstore 这样的开放技术栈是如此重要，其他打包存储库也可以采用这种技术。”\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/08/github-takes-action-to-prevent-supply-chain-attacks-on-open-source/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：lzx916 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

While your Agile coach should analyze any actual problems in the context of your organization, knowing these general issues can help better prepare you and your teams for the transitional process.\nNote that I only discuss is…",

The UK’s home secretary, Priti Patel, makes this clear in an op-ed for Tory mouthpiece The Telegraph this week, saying it would be a “grotesque betrayal” if the company didn’t consider issues of child safety while introducing E2EE. Similar arguments are likely to be raised in the US, too. \nMeta has been working on adding E2EE to Messenger for years, and recently confirmed that it aims to encrypt all chats and calls on the platform next year.

From this data in the knowledge graph, you can search, filter, view, analyze on a map or over time - or send alerts to Slack, send daily email summaries, or even connect via webhook to your own APIs.\n\nAlso, you can plugin machine learning APIs to extract even more information - via computer vision, text analysis or audio transcription.  We ship with some of the leading APIs out of the box (AssemblyAI, Roboflow, Primer), but you can also bring ML models that you, your company or a partner have built.\n\nWe have tons more features coming later this year, like ESRI ArcGIS integration, photogrammetry support, more data feeds and enrichments, and publishing out to other databases and platforms.\n\nWhen you signup for a free 14 day trial, you'll get 100GB of cloud storage and access to all our current features.\n\nTry it out today at https://portal.unstruk.ai, and we look forward to hearing what you think!\n\nThanks,\nKirk\n\nFounder, CEO\nUnstruk Data\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

Multilevel folders and tags are used for organization, and each snippet has fragments for even more granular structuring. The app supports Markdown so it can be used as a notebook if needed. \n\nWhat's New\n\nDirect support for TextMate grammars\n\nNow massCode uses Codemirror as the basis for the editor and `.tmLanguage` as the grammar for syntax highlighting. This tandem opens the door to over 600 existing grammars. The application currently supports more than 160 grammars. In addition to `.tmLanguage`, the application supports `.tmTheme` for themes. \n\nReal-time Render for HTML & CSS\n\nNow you can see the result of HTML & CSS directly in the application. This is such a CodePen on minimal :)\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nAdded support for [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mer...) - diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically.\n\nPresentation Mode\n\nmassCode allows you to make a presentation out of a sequence of snippets. It's great for classroom use, team meetings, conferences or simply reviewing notes on your own.\n\nScrenshots\n\nCreate beautiful snippet images on different backgrounds and in different modes.\n\nLocalization\n\nmassCode is available in English, Español, Português (Brasil), Русский, 中文 (简体), 中文 (繁體), 中文 (繁體 香港特別行政區) & 日本語 languages.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

I often ignore adding contact or feedback forms on most of my sites to avoid the hassle of setting forms.\n\nSo I thought if there's a free tool that lets me embed contact forms on any number of sites without writing code and just in a few steps, it would be great!\n\nThat's where this 𝑓𝗈𝗋𝗆𝗂𝖿𝗒 idea came to me.\n\n𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘂𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀:\n1. Ability to add different emails for different forms to receive notification\n2. Enhance the form script and add multiple color themes for users to select.\n3. Email notification toggler for each form\n\nHope this formify application will be helpful to all those who want to add contact forms to their sites without much hassle. 💫\n\nPlease share your views/feedback about this product.\n\nThank you for stopping by 🙏\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
