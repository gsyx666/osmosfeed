But the neat part is, wfc(short for wave function collapse) does all these without any artificial intelligence shenanigans. The output of wfc is a random showcase of the emergent behavior/rules built by you. This emergent behavior is what fascinates me! Now let's dive deeper into the nuances of wfc!\nIn this article we'll talk about image generation only, unless specified otherwise.

We made the decision to combine our various skill sets to form that business, and complexus was established.\nWe completed a few projects for other clients before deciding to concentrate on our website. We began by conducting research on our target market, and then the team began to work on the initial iteration of the site's design.\nIn this article, I'll primarily discuss the tools we utilized and how we used them to create our dynamic website. These are the tools we typically employ for our clients' projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Design\n\n\nThe design team used figma to create the site's design, and a screenshot of the …",

While these end products are generally the main event, it's easy to focus on making the product look nice and forget about the quality of code and reusability and ability to collaborate with other and for that project structure matters.\nThat being said there is no correct method of structuring your project but you should at least have some structure that we can follow for all our project for standardization.

          "description": "相信对于很多小伙伴来说，Twitter并非单纯是一个“社交”平台，而是“信息获取”平台。通过追踪各类名人、机构的账号来了解所关注领域的最新动向。比如最近火热的NFT、Web3.0社区中就有大量的意见领袖在Twitter发声。\n然而从获取信息效率的视角来看，常规Twitter浏览界面并不是特别友好，时间线上有着各类广告，同时经常用着用着就发现自己迷失在几十个选项卡和搜索结果页中。如果你遇到过类似问题，并希望提高在Twitter获取信息的效率，我会强烈推荐Tweetdeck这个功能。\nTweetdeck是Twitter官方提供的在线工具，有模块化，高度自定义化的浏览界面，不仅适合专业的Twitter运营人员工作使用，也非常适合个人用户来改造优化自己的信息时间线。通过对比图片，可以很清楚的看到两种模式的差异。Tweetdeck可以在设置中选择 黑/白 两种显示模式，我个人更喜欢黑暗模式，看起来更轻松。\n4K显示器下的twitter常规界面，大量留白非常浪费空间4K显示器下的tweetdeck界面\n \n基础介绍\nTweetdeck和常规界面相比最重要的功能主要是3点：自动刷新、多列显示和自定义模块。自动刷新不需要过多解释，节省频繁刷新的操作和时间。自定义模块可以定制每一列种显示的内容，例如：\n\n我想单独查看Elon Musk的所有推特或者他直发的内容。 - 单用户模式\n我希望把多个账号归为一个主题，单独浏览，如：NBA球星们、实时股市新闻、NFT相关资讯。 - 清单模式\n我想追踪网友对正在发生的热点事件的评论，如：WWDC大会、俄乌冲突事件等 - 搜索模式\n\n多列显示则大幅度提升了屏幕利用率，让我们可以同时间追踪上述这些不同的主题。\n\n上图是我最近使用Tweetdeck的截图，我通过Vivaldi浏览器“垂直平铺”功能在右边放置了Tesla AI Day的视频直播，在左边放置了Tweetdeck，并添加了：“tesla ai day”搜索结果列、“tesla bot”搜索结果列、Elon的个人内容列，和常用的市场资讯列。\n \n模块选择\n在Tweetdeck中，可以选择添加多种不同的模块，其中包含，\n内容类模块：单用户模式、搜索模式、清单模式、正在流行内容等\n功能类模块：通知、站内信、@我的、已预约内容等\n我并没有做账户运营的需求，因此最常使用的还是：搜索结果、单个用户、多用户清单这几个内容类模块。\n可添加模块截图\n \n搜索模式：\n显示关键词搜索结果配合自动刷新功能，达成“直播”的效果。并且可以通过设置条件对搜索结果进一步筛选，可设置条件包含：\n\n按推文类型过滤：例如包含图片、视频、GIF等的推文；或者是否显示“转发”内容。\n筛选内容的发布时间范围，最小单位可以精确到半个小时。\n按照推文语言类型筛选，例如：中文、英文、日语等。\n筛选推文发布者：选择特定的单个用户或者一组用户的搜索结果。\n内容互动情况：显示至少有多少点赞、转发或评论的内容。\n\n \n单用户模式 & 多用户清单：\n这2个模式本质差别就是关注用户的多少，选定关注范围后的筛选条件选项完全一致。在这2个模块中，同样可以通过设置筛选条件，包含：\n\n按推文类型过滤：例如包含图片、视频、GIF等的推文；或者是否显示“转发”内容。\n关键词过滤：显示或排除包含指定关键词的内容。\n用户筛选：由指定用户发布的内容 或 @特定用户的内容。\n\n在Tweetdeck追踪的，不管是单用户还是清单，并不要求是关注的账户。这点非常贴心，也帮助我区分不同使用场景，我把大量“新闻资讯”类账号从关注列表中去除，放在Tweetdeck清单中，日常在手机上浏览就不会被刷屏，而更关注轻松的内容，坐在电脑前则可以追踪查看这些庞杂的资讯。\n在Tweetdeck创建的清单可以选择设置为公开或者私有列表，同时这个列表也会同步到常规界面左侧的列表按钮中。\n\n \n模块设置：\n这几个内容模块中都可以单独设置“媒体展示尺寸大小”，可以大体理解为模块中每一条内容的高度。以及是否通过“声音”或者“桌面通知”的形式发送通知，提示关注的内容有更新。\n\nTweetdeck是简单，但又很强大的工具，给我带来了很多的便利，也希望分享给大家，打造适合自己的内容模块。\n \nPS：\nTweetdeck访问地址：https://tweetdeck.twitter.com\n今年Twitter官方下架了Tweetdeck的桌面客户端软件，仅提供网页版本，如果想在电脑上安装独立客户端可以使用Tweeten，有Windows和Mac版本，并且基于Tweetdeck提供了更多的功能。\nTweeten部分功能展示\n题图源自：Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n更多内容欢迎访问我的个人博客：「假设检验」",

          "description": "@brendan_maginnis, @nick_thapen, and I are back and we’re very excited to be sharing the new version of Sourcery with you all. \n\nSourcery sits in the background while you work analyzing your code, finding problems, and suggesting improvements to make sure it’s following best practices. You can think of it as the first layer of code review, catching mistakes before a human reviewer needs to take a look. As always - Sourcery runs fully locally, so your code is private.\n\nHere’s what’s new:\n\n1. Extend Sourcery to handle your best practices. You shouldn’t have to make the same comment more than one time in a code review. When you see issues coming up frequently you can create a Sourcery rule, and these issues will get caught for your whole team before the code is merged. \n\n2. Leverage Pre-Built Rulesets. We’ve taken the Google Python Style Guide and made it available as a (set of Sourcery rules). Pick and choose the rules that make sense for you (and customize them how you want) or add in the full ruleset.\n\n3. CLI for bulk review. We’ve extended the Sourcery CLI to make it more powerful (and much quicker) for reviewing multiple files, or your entire repo. With a single command you can scan hundreds of files, identify common issues, and make bulk changes to improve your code.  \n\n4. Review every commit with Sourcery in CI. Let Sourcery handle the first layer of your code reviews by adding it to your CI. Sourcery is easily configurable to run only on changed code to help cut down on noise from legacy code. \n\nAnyone can start using Sourcery for free, and teams coming through ProductHunt with promo code PRODUCTHUNT2022 can use the full team version (includes full use in CI or as a pre—commit hook - see more details at https://sourcery.ai/team/) for free for 2 months.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

As a freelancer, you ended up subscribing to many services like Adobe CC, Envato Elements, Render forest, etc... Once you get to the cap of your monthly payments budget, you can't keep adding tools that require monthly payments as well! So I was looking for an alternative powerful enough to handle my needs and that doesn't offer a subscription only deal. I found Pasty! This app was more powerful than Paste, and it also offers a one time payment deal. It changed my life and put me back on track, giving me the productivity speed and useful features I was used to with Paste app. If you're like me and need an alternative without a monthly payment, Pasty is without a doubt better, faster and super useful. I recommend this app 100%.

I started working on Blogic last year, and life got in the way. To be honest, my second kid 👶 is awesome, by the way.  I got back to working on beta and had 300+ beta signups and lots of customer feedback; I mean a lot, which is insanely awesome. It's finally ready to be shipped. Thanks for the early testers; Blogic wouldn't come this far without you; I seriously mean it. It's one thing I avoided for so long, talking to customers, but it's worth it. Sorry, back to business. \n\nHow did it start?\nI am a big fan of Notion; it's one of the products that you can't shut up with your family and colleagues at your office.

We decided to step it up a notch and embark on our next journey. \n\nOur latest product Magicul X is a design file editor, which can open almost any design file. The first release we will support opening Adobe XD and Figma files. Compatibility with Sketch, Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator files should follow shortly after the launch.\n\nWe are extremely curious to hear what you guys think and what feature you think would set us apart from Figma and Adobe XD (wait aren't they the same now 😅☠️).\n\nThe product is still under heavy development, but you can sign up for a wait list to get early access. In particular we wanted to collect early feedback from the community... so here we go, fire away 🚀\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
