Not to disrespect you, but in that case, keep doing what you are doing.\nReact classnames rock when it comes to dynamic classes or combined classes.\nA combined class, for instance, if we allow the className to be passed from a parent component like this.\n<div className={`existing-class ${className}`}>\n\nOr even classes that render conditionally.\n<div className={`existing-class ${success && 'bg-green'}`}>\n\nLet's see how this would like with React classnames, but before we dive into that, we have to install it first.\nnpm install classnames\n\nI tend to import it differently, so I never get confused with the default className by doing this.\nimport classnames from 'classnames';\n\nAnd now we can use it like this.\n<div className={classnames('foo', 'bar')}></div>\n\nOr, in the more advanced examples, we can do stuff like this:\n<div className={classNames('existing-class', className)}>\n\n<div className={classNames('existing-class', 'bg-green': success)}>\n\nAnd this is where it shines. It's a great way to abstract, difficult class conditions to be more readable.\nFor the result of your output code, it doesn't matter which way you go. It will be the same.\nIf you are an avid React user and use conditional classes, I would like you to try classnames.\nThank you for reading my blog.

          "description": "前天，我收到了腾讯官方发来的一个警告：\n\r\n\r\n“因用户投诉并经平台审核，你的小程序涉嫌滥用小程序接口能力，影响用户体验行为。”\n\r\n\r\n惊讶之下，我发现是我们几年前为了解决公众号文章内不能放置链接而开发的“文章助手”小程序被警告了。\n\r\n众所周知，一般情况下，微信文章不能像网页一样放入链接的。对于一般的文字性内容，这其实并无大碍，但是对于我们这种技术类文章，常常会有一些链接，以便读者可以深入了解相关内容。因此，这种限制对我们来说是一种缺陷，为了解决这种问题，我们陆续想过几种方法，比如利用文末的“阅读原文”、在文章内注明完整链接等。最后，我们在 2019 年想到可以开发一个小程序来 辅助提供 这个链接。\n\r\n通过一些 简单的方式，可以在你的微信文章中需要放置链接的地方嵌入这个“文章助手”小程序。用户只需要点击该小程序链接，即可显示该链接，并自动复制链接到剪贴板，然后只需要打开浏览器粘贴访问即可。\n\r\n我自己对这种委曲求全的解决方案感觉比较满意。\n\r\n现在，这个有两年没有继续添加新功能的小程序被警告了。于是我仔细查看了警告内容，在腾讯官方提供的《微信小程序平台运营规范》中是这样说的：\n\r\n\r\n5.15.4 滥用操作剪切板接口\n\r\n在用户使用剪切板功能进行复制操作后，恶意、强行中断小程序内功能服务或业务的完整流程，要求用户跳转或使用其他方式才可完整体验业务流程，影响用户体验。\n\r\n用户未进行任何操作情况下，小程序默认读取用户剪切板信息。\n\r\n\r\n考虑到申诉基本上不会得到解决（事实上我申诉了，也被驳回了），我只能修改相关代码，将以下行为做了调整：\n\r\n\r\n不检测剪贴板内容长度（原本是为了避免当剪贴板内有较多内容而被覆盖）\n\r\n不自动复制链接到剪贴板，而需要用户手动点击一下才复制\n\r\n\r\n以我的估计，这样就不算滥用了吧？……\n\r\n然而，新版本提交之后，紧接着，“文章助手”小程序就被封了剪贴板能力：\n\r\n\r\n因用户投诉并经平台审核，发现帐号已发布的服务涉嫌滥用小程序接口能力，影响用户体验\n\r\n已封禁服务的“操作剪贴板”能力\n\r\n\r\n哑然。\n\r\n无奈之下再次发起无用的申诉（已被驳回），并寻求客服解答。经过漫长的等待，客服给出了如下答复：\n\r\n\r\n审核部门排查发现你的小程序内活动通过文本口令引导跳转其他渠道体验或进行，属于滥用剪切板能力 请开发者对小程序进行全面排查以及整改，将涉及违规的内容移除(包括但不仅限于内容展示、代码、路径等)，如有隐藏内容、路径、代码等，也需一并移除\n\r\n\r\n呵，合着是不让用户粘贴链接到浏览器啊！\n\r\n原本“文章助手”小程序内会提示用户“链接已复制，请在浏览器内粘贴打开”，看来这是摸了老虎屁股了。\n\r\n而没有剪贴板能力的“文章助手”小程序，可以说是已经失去了一半用处。\n\r\n那现在我有两个选择：\n\r\n\r\n放弃这个小程序（这样我也不用每个月支付云开发的 20 元费用，需要说明的是，这个小程序是完全免费，没有任何广告和赞助，公益提供给任何人使用的）；\n\r\n看看是否还有抢救的机会。\n\r\n\r\n考虑到这个小程序已经累计有了 16 万用户，并为近 50 万个链接提供过服务，如果就此关闭，是对既往用户的不负责。因此，经过我灵机一动，我考虑可以完整地显示链接，让用户自己复制，至于复制后干什么，我不说，我也不知道，我也不想知道。\n\r\n所以，你看的 0.4.7 版的“文章助手”就是这样了。\n\r\n至于这样是否还会触犯腾讯的禁忌，我就不知道了，只能说，大家且行且珍惜吧。",

          "description": "近几年区块链逐渐火热以后，「去中心化」的概念逐渐受到关注。\n去中心化指的是：在一个分布有众多节点的系统中，每个节点都具有高度自治的特征。\n回想一下，你的各种私有资料都储存在哪里？\n文档都在 WPS 的云盘，或者散落在各种文件夹中；\n音频文件可能分散在网易云音乐、QQ 音乐、酷狗等等音频平台，如果你喜欢音乐的本地化，也许会下载到某个文件夹中；\n至于相片这种更为私人的东西，则有可能在手机本地相册或者选择百度网盘、iCloud 等等网络云盘中。\n我们经常会把同类的文件分散在各处，当我们想去寻找的时候却往往难以在一个确定的地方查询；又或者遭遇到了平台倒闭，难以取回储存在云空间中的珍贵资料。\n所以对于文件的「中心化」储存和管理，是一个值得尝试的文件管理形式。\n我认为其中有三个核心：集中管理、本地优先、在线引用\n将「中心化」概念运用到相册管理中\n比如图片的管理，拿我的个人相册举例。\n我们的手机每天都会有很多图片产生：屏幕截图、自拍、风景等等照片，但并非所有的照片都值得长期保存，所以要定期清理无关照片，备份重要的相片。\n\n我从大学时期就开始使用谷歌相册管理我的手机相片，这个堪称当下功能最强大的在线相册，会智能地自动备份相机拍下的所有照片、屏幕截图，甚至还有其他 APP 中保存的图片。同时也可以一键清理本地已备份的图片，节省手机空间。\n五年多过去了，我的谷歌相册中积攒了无数张相片，其中超过一半以上的图片都是无关的废片，混杂在各种较为重要的照片中，我花了很长时间都难以删除这些图片。\n于是我国庆期间我批量下载了所有的相片，大约 5w 张，其中绝大部分图片都是各种被自动备份的无关照片，经过大约三天的筛选，最终保留下了差不多 7000 多张照片。\n那么问题来了，如何让我的相册不再受到污染，能够自动备份到谷歌相册中，而且我希望能够保留一份相册在本地，在我删除本地照片的时候自动在云端也删除。\n我采取的…",

          "description": "灵动岛是今年iPhone的热点更新。我们在早期的时候，看到了很多针对灵动岛的玩法，比如在岛的周围养宠物、用灵动岛打游戏、适配灵动岛的挖孔壁纸等。\n但是，这些玩法从系统和功能层面，并没有用到真正的“灵动岛接口”。在苹果开发者文档中，灵动岛实际上是一种“实时活动”。在某些用户需要实时关注状态变化的场景下，为用户展示信息。比如实时更新比赛数据、实时更新外卖进度、实时更新计时器、实时更新地图导航指引等等。\n如果iPhone安装了iOS 16.1系统，在iPhone 14 Pro机型上，实时活动可以在灵动岛和锁屏界面展示；而在非iPhone 14 Pro机型，则只在锁屏界面展示。\n\nOneWidget如何定位灵动岛？\n仔细阅读苹果开发者文档之后，我们发现实时活动的实现方式和小组件有非常多重叠的地方。同时，不管在锁屏界面还是“展开的”灵动岛位置，它的尺寸都很像中尺寸的桌面小组件。再者，实时活动不能够交互、也不能有动画、不能随时刷新，这些和小组件都太像了。所以，我们最终把实时活动定位成“一种特殊的小组件”。\n当我们把“灵动岛”定义为“实时展示的小组件”，那么一切就更简单了，原则上小组件能够实现的它都可以实现。只是我们需要额外思考，在锁屏和灵动岛这两个特殊的位置，用户凭什么要展开来用它。\nOneWidget怎么做灵动岛功能？\n在迭代产品的2年多时间里，OneWidget的各种类型的小组件从用户那里得到了很多不错的回馈。当我们复盘这些小组件，用户最关心的是三个关键词：实用、美观、趣味。所以，设计灵动岛这个特殊的小组件，我们应该做的也是实用、美观、趣味。另外补充一点，对于很多用户来说，美观、趣味也是一种实用价值，美观带来个性化的装饰、趣味带来功能的尝鲜探索。\n从实用和便捷角度，我们设计了“启动之岛”和“健康之岛”。\n从美观和趣味角度，我们设计了“宠物之岛”和“摆烂之岛”。\n\n如何开启灵动岛？\n如果iPhone更新到iOS 16.1以上，下载OneWidget 的3.6.0以上的版本之后，可以进入个人中心找到主入口。在灵动岛配置页面，选择需要开启的“岛屿”，当App进入后台或者切换到其他App，实时活动就已经开启在了锁屏界面和灵动岛区域。\n配置入口我们还单独设计了一些细节：会动的海平面、开启后的彩色提示框、预览效果等。\n\n宠物之岛\n用户可以在“宠物之岛”领养一个自己的电子宠物，它每天陪你玩、会饿、会困、会渴，在不同的状态下用户需要点击不同的操作。我们给宠物取了一个名字叫做“岛岛”，领养之后，在App内还会显示领养的天数。岛岛除了不同的状态，也有可能会出去玩耍，只有等他回来才能再次跟他互动。为了满足个性化，宠物“岛岛”还允许自定义颜色，现在我们支持了7种颜色的切换。\n\n启动之岛\n“启动之岛”可以允许用户添加快速启动App或者小程序的入口，常驻在锁屏界面和灵动岛里，展开之后即可点击一键直达的App。用户可以添加1~6的常用启动入口，根据添加的数量变化，图标和间距会自动调整来适应合适的布局。和锁屏小组件、桌面小组件一行，这里的启动器入口支持添加常用的App、微信支付宝的二级路径、微信和支付宝的小程序入口。\n\n摆烂之岛\n“摆烂之岛”将随机展示一些“反鸡汤”的插画和文案。这个功能为了满足“趣味性”，该卷的时候卷，该躺的时候也要好好躺。偶尔摆烂无可厚非，休息是人之常情。\n\n健康之岛\n“健康之岛”实时展示用户当天的健康数据，比如步数、运动时间、消耗能量、身高、体重等。尤其是对于每日会更新变动的数据，是可以查看更新数据的（不过目前系统刷新问题，会有较多延迟）。\n\n \n以上就是OneWidget关于灵动岛功能的思考和功能的介绍。希望帮助大家了解灵动岛，也能够帮助大家通过这些小功能体验到灵动岛（实时活动）的用法。我们将继续做好一个“装修产品”，带来更多实用、美观、有趣的功能。\n回见。",

It was capable of performing only extremely simple mathematical operations on very small unsigned integers.

However, when you start coding or using special network utilities or commands, you might care about your own PATH variable.\n\nMore great content\nFree online course: RHEL technical overview\nLearn advanced Linux commands\nDownload cheat sheets\nFind an open source alternative\nExplore open source resources\nThe …",

Charity Majors coined the term and has written about it in several articles, including Observability: A Manifesto. She explains the term in this quote:\nDo you bake observability right into your code as you're writing it? The best engineers do a form of \"observability-driven-development\" — they understand their software as they write it, include instrumentation when they ship it, then check it regularly to make sure it looks as expected.

Out of the box all of your episodes will be searchable, linking to the exact moment you’re looking for.  Remember that time Lex’s guest talked about whether “AI will kill us all”? Or want to find when you had that “person that works on RNA stuff”? Now you can. Once you’ve found that favorite moment, copy the link and share it with your listeners, or that person on Twitter you think it might be useful for. Your page updates automatically when new episodes are posted.\n\nA year ago building something like this would have required a PhD and writing a ton of machine learning code. We think that building search that understands opaque content like audio should be simple as making a couple API calls. We’re building a search platform that enables these user experiences, and it’s what powering the site you see here (blog post on how to use it coming soon!). If you have audio or other content you’d like to make searchable we’d love to help you, please get in touch - https://airtable.com/shr3ukDZGRv....\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
