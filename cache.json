Let's look at the problem first.\nWe need to create the following container by using CSS Properties only:\n\nSo now look at the Solution and how we are going to achieve this. \n<p c>\n<p l>\n<p r> \n\n<p c> : Center Circle\n<p l> : Left Triangle\n<p r> : Right Triangle\n* {\n  margin: 0;\n  background: #0b2429;\n}\n\nbody {\n  display: grid;\n  place-items: center;\n}\n\np { position: absolute }\n\n[c] {\n  width: 50;\n  height: 50;\n  border-radius: 1in;\n  border: 45px solid #f3ac3c;\n  box-shadow: 0 0 0 20px #0b2429, \n              0 0 0 30px #998235;\n  z-index: 1;\n}\n\n[l], [r] {\n  height: 160;\n  width: 82;\n  clip-path: polygon(0 50%, 100% 100%, 100% 0);\n  background: #998235;\n}\n\n[l] { left: 58 }\n\n[r] {\n  right: 57;\n  transform: scalex(-1);\n}\n\n\nNote: In CSS Battle you can use 100 instead of 100px. You don't need to define px in CSS. However, if you are using rem or %, you need to pass them separately. That's why in the above CSS code there are no units mostly. For more info visit here\nMinify the code or CSS by using any CSS Minifier. It helps you to reduce the characters in the code which will increase the score.\nMinified Version:\n<p c><p l><p r><style>*{margin:0;background:#0B2429}body{display:grid;place-items:center}p{position:absolute}[c]{width:50;height:50;border-radius:1in;border:45px solid #F3AC3C;box-shadow:0 0 0 20px #0B2429,0 0 0 30px #998235;z-index:1}[l],[r]{height:160;width:82;clip-path:polygon(0 50%,100% 100%,100% 0);background:#998235}[l]{left:58}[r]{right:57;transform:scalex(-1)}\n\n@css_battle \n#CSS #webdevelopment #developer #html #design #timelapse #CSSChallenge #developer #web #CSSBattle \n    \nThere are many ways to solve this.

          "description": "使用这个开源工具，即使是批量校正图像也很容易。\n\r\n\r\n多年前，在翻阅一家旧书店的书架上的内容时，我偶然发现了一本名为 《UNIX System Command Summary for Berkeley 4.2 & 4.3 BSD》 的小册子，由 Specialized Systems Consultants 出版。我买它是出于好奇，因为它已经有将近 20 年的历史了，但仍然在很大程度上适用于现代 Linux 和 BSD。\n\r\n无论是当时还是现在，我都很开心。一本写于 1986 年的小册子在 2016 年仍然很重要，而同一个书架上关于专有操作系统的书籍并不值得印刷它们的纸张。（想一想：你认为什么技术可以在僵尸末日中幸存下来？）这本小册子已经放在我自己的书架上好几年了，但我突然想到可能值得对这个作品做一点数字保存，所以我决定扫描这本小册子来创建一本 CBZ 电子书。\n\r\n使用 Skanlite 进行扫描很容易，但很耗时。然而，当我完成后，我发现有些页面不是很平整。\n\r\n\n\r\n在打印中，这称为配准问题，这意味着打印内容的位置在页面上的方向不正确。\n\r\nImageMagick\n\r\nImageMagick 是基于终端的非交互式图形编辑器。尝试在无图形环境（如纯文本终端）中编辑图形似乎违反直觉，但实际上很常见。例如，当你将图像上传到 Web 应用用作个人资料图片时，应用服务器上的脚本可能会使用 ImageMagick 或其库处理你的图像。非交互式编辑器的优点是你可以制定需要对示例图像执行的操作，然后只需按一下按钮即可将这些效果应用于数百个其他图像。\n\r\nImageMagick 通常与其他图形编辑器一样强大，只要你花时间了解它的许多功能以及如何组合它们以实现所需的效果。在这种情况下，我想旋转歪斜的页面。在搜索了 ImageMagick 的文档后，我发现我需要的解决方案的 ImageMagick 术语称为纠偏。将你的术语与其他人的术语保持一致对于你不知道的任何事情都是一个挑战，因此当你使用 ImageMagick（或其他任何东西）时，请记住，你描述问题或解决方案的用词可能和别人不一样。\n\r\n要使用 ImageMagick 对带有弯曲文本的图像进行校正：\n\r\n$ convert page_0052.webp -deskew25% fix_0052.webp\r\n\n\r\n-deskew 选项表示可接受偏差的阈值。通过跟踪看似字母的对象的峰谷来确定倾斜。根据扫描的弯曲程度，你可能需要多于或少于 25% 的阈值。我已经达到了 80%，到目前为止，低于 25% 没用效果。\n\r\n结果如下：\n\r\n\n\r\n修复了！将其应用于文档的剩余 55 页以修复倾斜的页面，而对已经笔直的页面不做任何事情。换句话说，由于我的阈值设置，在不需要调整的页面上运行此命令是安全的。\n\r\n使用 ImageMagick 裁剪图像\n\r\n在纠正了歪斜之后，因为我扫描每一页都比必要的范围要多，以防止意外切断单词，我认为裁剪我纠正的页面是有意义的。我很高兴在页边空白处保留一些空间，但没有以前那么多。我经常使用 ImageMagick 的“裁剪”功能来处理这个网站上的图像，所以我很熟悉这个选项。但是，我需要确定如何裁剪每一页。\n\r\n首先，我需要图像的大小：\n\r\n$ identify fixed_0052.webp\r\nWEBP 1128x2593 1128x2593+0+08-bit sRGB 114732B 0.020u 0:00.021\r\n\n\r\n知道尺寸后，我能够对我可以承受的丢失多少像素做出一些估计。经过几次试运行，我得到了这个：\n\r\nconvert fix_0052.webp -gravity Center -crop 950x2450+0+0 crop_0052.webp\r\n\n\r\n这并不完全适合，但当我将它应用于册子中的其他图像时，它被证明很重要。这些页面的内容和扫描仪位置各不相同，所以我很高兴给每一页一点空余空间。\n\r\n这是校正和裁剪的图像：\n\r\n\n\r\n使用开源批量编辑图像\n\r\nImageMagick 的美妙之处在于，当你确定了修复图像的公式，你就可以将该修复应用于需要相同修复的所有图像。我使用 GNU Parallel 执行此操作，它使用我所有的 CPU 内核来完成数百页的图像校正。这并不需要很长时间，而且结果不言而喻。更重要的是，我已经有了一个 UNIX 历史上有趣作品的数字档案。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/11/fixing-scanned-images-imagemagick\n\r\n作者：Seth Kenlon 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "这些年来，我通过这些开源资源提高了我的 Python 技能。\n\r\n\r\n我最近决定进一步学习 Python，以便提高我的教学技能，拓宽我的学生的视野。在这个过程中，我发现了这些优秀的资源，让我学习新的代码，并提高了对 Python 的整体理解。\n\r\n1、《教孩子学编程 Python 语言版》\n\r\n我的 Python 之旅大约是 7 年前开始的，当时我发现了 Apple LOGO 和 Python 中的 Turtle 模块 之间的联系。当时使用的 Linux 计算机的默认 Python 版本为 Python 2.7，我很快发现我想使用 Python 3。我成功地安装了它，并开始使用 Turtle 模块编写一些简单的程序。在阅读 Dr. Bryson Payne 的 《教孩子学编程 Python 语言版》 之后，我意识到 Python 不仅仅是 Turtle。那时我安装了 IDLE。\n\r\n2、IDLE\n\r\n在使用 IDLE 工作的过程中，交互式界面优化了我的体验，并让我有足够的信心来考虑向学生教授 Python。我志愿帮助我社区中的一群在家学习的孩子，很快我发现自己在教授一个有十六个孩子的班级！我很高兴他们的父母同意帮助我，否则我想我会被压垮。这个经历激发了我学习更多的欲望，以便我可以教授更多。\n\r\n3.、Mu 编辑器\n\r\n2018 年春天，我参加了 PyConUS。我听了一场由中学老师 Nicholas Tollervey 主讲的演讲，他为学龄前儿童编写了一个 Python 开发环境。Mu 编辑器 内置了一个可以帮助我找到代码中的错误的 质检工具Linter。Mu 帮助我提高了我的编码技能，我也能够与学生分享这些技能，他们也从中受益。\n\r\n我的自信和经验增长后，我希望与更多的学生分享 Python 之旅。我与其他人合作撰写了一个申请书，以教授一个使用树莓派 4 和 Python 的课程。疫情打断了这个计划。在此期间，树莓派基金会发布了树莓派 400。2021 年春天，我使用了前一年开发的材料和一个来自当地图书馆的慷慨的资助，来 教授两组 学生如何编程。这个活动非常成功并在今年再次举办。\n\r\n4、Codium\n\r\n几年前，我了解到微软的 VS Code 是一个可以在 Linux 上使用的开源代码编辑器。我最近才了解到，如何在 VS Code 中配置和使用 Python 虚拟环境。我的问题在一篇 关于虚拟环境的文章 中得到了解答，这让我可以知道如何在 Linux 计算机上设置和配置 Python 虚拟环境。大约在同一时间，我发现了 Codium，一个围绕 VS Code 构建的社区项目。\n\r\n现在我希望与我的学生分享 VS Codium 的体验，并让他们对 Python 的理解不再局限于 Turtle 模块。这种学习的热情让我寻找开源且可以在互联网上随意获得的教学资源。\n\r\n5、《Python 编程练习，简单解释》\n\r\n《Python 编程快速上手 让繁琐工作自动化》 这本书是我最喜欢的一本书。现在，作者已经发布了 《Python 编程练习，简单解释》。这两本书都可以免费在线阅读，并且都采用了知识共享许可证。\n\r\n6、《每个人都可以使用 Python》\n\r\nDr. Charles Severance 在 2017 年发布了 《每个人都可以使用 Python》，我非常推荐这本书。他为像我这样的有抱负的程序员提供了简短的课程。课程的代码可以在 GitHub 上找到，所以你可以下载它并在自己的计算机或学校网络上安装它。\n\r\n7. Python 视频\n\r\n最近，我了解到 Jay LaCroix 在 YouTube 上有一系列精彩的视频，其中包括 28 个免费视频，从 Python 基础开始，涵盖了 Python 编程 的全面介绍。最重要的是，他使用的是 Linux 计算机，因此他的课程特别适合 Linux 编程环境。这些视频的其中一个收获是学习如何使用 nano 作为编程环境，它默认情况下包含在大多数 Linux 发行版中。\n\r\n你的学习之路\n\r\n此处提到的这七个资源帮助我成长为一名程序员，它们都是开源的并可以与其他人分享。你是如何提高编程技能的？你有什么要分享的吗？在评论中告诉我们。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/11/learn-python\n\r\n作者：Don Watkins 选题：lkxed 译者：Cubik65536 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "虽然现在多屏用户逐渐变多，但仍是小众，Windows 也并没过对多屏使用进行太多的优化。所以只好自己动手，于是有了以下一些个人自用的优化设置。\n窗口出现位置优化\nWindows 系统仅对多屏用户提供了简单主显示器的设置，默认情况下所有新打开的窗口都只会出现在主显示器上，即使你在使用另一个的显示器。而「基于显示器连接记住窗口位置」只能记住上次关闭时所在的屏幕，实用性并不高。\n\n这时微软自家的 Power Toys 里的 FancyZones 就可以派上用场了，除了我们熟知的窗口布局设置外，它还可以调整窗口行为，在这里我们可以通过启用「将新创建的窗口移动到当前 活动的监视器（实验性）」来达到这一效果，美中不足的是动画不够优雅。\n\n窗口出现的问题解决了，但任务栏上默认是显示所有屏幕上的窗口，不能让我们快速区分哪些应用是在当前屏幕下的。\n\n为了解决该问题，如下图所示，Windows 提供了简陋的选项加让人摸不着头脑的翻译。设置后，每个屏幕下的任务栏就只显示当前屏幕下打开的窗口，更符合直觉，不过 Win + 数字 的快捷键就只能在主显示器上使用了。\n\n内容显示优化\n现在 Windows 下大部分的应用都适配高 DPI 的，少部分不支持的，也可以通过 Windows 自带的属性 - 兼容性选项来调整。\n\n上面的设置仅解决了单个应用在高分辨率屏幕下的问题，并不能解决应用在分辨率相差太大的显示器间移动时会出现界面变形问题。这时，如果你使用的 AMD 显卡，那你可以通过启用 AMD Radeon Software 里的「超虚拟分辨率」来让低分辨率屏切换到更高的逻辑分辨率，不仅缩小的多屏间的分辨率差距，还有抗锯齿的效果。由于个人没有使用 Nvidia 和 Intel 显卡，相关选项是否存在请自行到显卡设置里翻找。\n\n设置完成后到 Windows 设置调整下逻辑分辨率和缩放即可。\n\n除此之外，对于我们网上冲浪必备的浏览器，它的缩放是固定的，且只有一个设置选项。不知道有没有人跟我一样两个屏幕的缩放比例是不一样的，在两个屏幕间移动浏览器时，网页内容并不会根据 DPI 而变化，导致观感割裂。在这里我推荐一个 FireFox 浏览器插件：ffreszoom，它可以实时感知屏幕宽度的变化，当宽度超过指定值时，自动调整到指定缩放比例。设置前先通过这个网站查看自己的屏幕宽度：http://whatismyscreenresolution.net/，需要将 Firefox 浏览器移动到不同显示器上刷新。\n\n如图所示我的外屏宽度是 1728 px，笔记本内屏为 1024，所以我在两者之间随意取了一个值用于判断，若当前屏幕宽度超过 1600 px，就自动设置缩放为 1.5，也即 150%。若小于 1600 px，则使用浏览器设置里的值。两种缩放无缝切换，只会多了一个缩放的动画。由于本人没使用 Chromium 类浏览器，并没有对应的插件推荐，不过其用户这么多，应该会有类似的插件。\n\n利用「闲置的」触摸板\n不知有没有跟我一样喜欢使用笔记本键盘的，且平时一些简单的操作直接用触摸板直接操作。现在 Windows 11 已经支持自定义触摸板多指手势了，但其不能根据不同应用设置不同的手势，例如：A 软件可以用 Ctrl  + W 关闭，但 B 软件只能用 Alt + F4，同一个操作有不同的快捷键。\n\n这时就需要第三方软件了，这里我推荐 GestureSign，界面虽然是 Windows 10 风格，但不影响使用，毕竟设置完就不用再看了。它可以为不同应用的不同快捷键键设置相同的触控手势，手势类型也不再仅限于横平竖直，可以自由发挥。同时软件也内置了一些常用的命令供选择。\n\n上图是我的一些设置，双指一般使用系统默认就不添加上去了。其中个人最爱的是三指滑动切换标签，体验比鼠标点击更加符合人的直觉。对于频繁使用搜索启动器的我，把三指上滑指定为搜索启动器的快捷键，方便呼出。\n \n对了，设置前记得把系统自带的相关手势取消掉，不然会冲突。若你仍不习惯使用触摸板，该软件也支持鼠标手势，具体可以自行下载体验。\n结尾\n以上便是我在使用多屏时遇到的问题，及相关解决方法，希望对多屏用户有帮助。",

          "description": "@nrek ) and in 2017 I started to put an application together to address the Tokyo 2020 Olympics called Wandur. The market research, consumer analysis, application POC, and various other aspects of the product were all pieced together through the end of 2019, with a  plan to launch at the end of Q4 2019. \n\nCOVID. \n\nWell, everything got put on hold, and the Olympics came and went. Now, here we are, post-pandemic, 5 years after the inception of an idea, 3 years after developing the POC, and just a few months after vaccination cards and mask requirements have been lifted, ready to rock again. \n\nThe launch phase of Wandur lacks layers of complexity to focus on user acquisition by providing curated maps that help navigate landmarks through scenic areas of walkable tourist destinations. This period exists to allow Wandur to accumulate gig workers who will operate as travel guides/companions. The path is pretty straightforward - gather users, make guides available, and release follow-up features based on app usage. \n\nIt's just a matter of marketing, timing, and narrow focus - it's why we've chosen Rome, Italy as the first city where Wandur will be available. Wandur is set to launch in early/mid 2023.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "@itsmaleen, I'm super stoked to introduce Jive 😊\n\nWhy Jive\n==========\nThe main thing that keeps us coming back to Twitter is the content. Specifically, the nuggets of value hidden in great threads written by brilliant builders and creators. From how-tos to opinion pieces, we've found that threads are a treasure trove of information that rival any blog.\n\nThe Problem\n==========\nAlthough there is a lot of value in Twitter threads, and that creators put lots of time / energy into creating them, there is no real place for them to live permanently. Too often do great threads fade away in the avalanche of new content. Now that there is some concern about the future of the platform, we want to ensure that no content gets lost.\n\nThe Solution\n==========\nSo, why not help creators turn their already written out content into a personal blog? Well, that's what we did.\n\nFor Creators:\n✍️ Automatically turn threads into a personal blog\n📈 Track analytics across topics and posts\n🔭 Have your content discoverable with a new audience\n\nFor Readers:\n🧭 Explore new topics and creators\n🔖 Bookmark relevant threads\n🖤 Follow topics that interest you\n\nIf you want an easier way to go through valuable Twitter content without the noise, or if you want to leverage your existing work, join Jive!\n\nComing soon: export your Twitter threads to publishing platforms you love (whether that's Jive, Medium, Mirror, etc.)\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

During that time, thanks to fantastic community feedback, it has become a suite of 3 unique AI art tools (with more to come):\n\n\n🪄 AI Editor\n\nA graphics-like editor based on an infinite canvas putting different AI models together in one interface. An advanced and professional tool that can be used for:\n👉🏻 Outpainting → expanding pictures beyond their original borders\n👉🏻 Inpainting → erasing part of an image and filling it with new objects based on a given text\n👉🏻 Text to image → generating images with just text\n👉🏻 Image to image → modifying the style of an image\n👉🏻 Find & Replace → replacing parts of an image using only text, e.g., replace \"t-shirt.\" with a \"suit.\"\n👉🏻 Face enhancement → improving the quality of generated faces\n\n\n📝 Text to Image\n\nSimple interface for generating images with just text. Great start for AI art beginners that offers more advanced users the possibility to play with a set of generation guiding parameters.\n\n\n🖼️ Image to Image\n\nA tool for modifying existing images or generating their variations with text prompts. Best for changing the style of the picture, e.g., \"make this image look like van Gogh painting.\"\n\n______\n\nLet me know what you think!
