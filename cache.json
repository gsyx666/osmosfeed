It's created and owned by a Company, they specify parameters and then invite an Architect and one or many Contractors.  \nIt's clear that ConstructionProject will have states. DDD tells us that good thinking about states must tie them back to operations, initiated either by actors in the system or time (some deadline date arrives etc.).  \nSo, naively, we have CreateConstructionProject operation that produces a CP in draft state. Company fills the draft CP out over time and at some point they're ready to progress to some next stage, maybe to seeking_building_permissions via ConstructionProjectSeeksBuildingPermisions operation.\nBut say the company wants to make amendments to the CP once it's started seeking building permissions, changes that would not affect the parameters of land needed etc.?\nA bad design would introduce a new state editing and write logic to disambiguate the data in this editing state VS a previous non-editing state, making editing a ghost state.\nA better approach is to take inspiration from Git and treat any edits as a \"feature branch\" of the real CP, which remains in seeking_building_permissions state. Once edits are complete and ready to be applied, call ApplyEditsToConstructionProject operation which applies edits. CP has never exited seeking_building_permissions state and no special handling looking up previous non-editing state has been needed.\nKISS",

However, I think videos work best when describing procedures.\nDiagrams are cool but it would be even more awesome if objects on diagrams can move :D.\nSo I created a tool to do just that: Helps me create videos to explain processes quickly.\nYou may say: Hey, there are many great video tool out there that you can learn in a few hours and they can do more than what you need!\nYes, I know. Great tools (even free) are out there but being able to create something outweigh all reasons.\nI ended up spending mostly a week creating the first \"usable\" version.\nSo here it is:\n\nhttps://vanim.datmt.com/\nI created a video showing how to use the app here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RE6RbT69VS0\nYou can go there and start playing with the tool. You can create some shapes, use images to create moving diagrams...\nHere is one example I created to explain the concept of CountDownLatch in Java\nI have some ideas in mind. The main purpose is to make creating videos even easier. I know the app is primitive now but I can now create some nice animation for my blog :).\nYour suggestions are highly appreciated!\nThis app is not possible without the following projects:\nFabricjs http://fabricjs.com/: It is the engine that run the app. Thanks!\nJenkins: Thanks to this awesome projects, I can literally push new changes online in just a single click.\nThanks for your attention.

          "description": "历史长河的锚点\n近段期间《梦华录》热播，我在豆瓣上看到网友“黄小胖”吐槽说，“感觉《梦华录》的制作方确实不完全理解北宋官制。”比如顾千帆的父亲说“你十八岁中进士，要是好好干，现在也是个翰林学士了。”事实上翰林学士官职极高，30岁左右的顾千帆正常情况下距离翰林学士还有很远的距离。\n《梦华录》\n同样的，顾千帆“兴平军节度使，参知政事，知苏州事”的父亲，这个“知苏州事”并不一定主政苏州。顾千帆父亲的历史原型可能是丁谓，有一段时间官名为持节苏州诸军事，苏州刺史，这些都不是实际岗位，都是他实际官名平江军节度使的自然延伸。换言之，丁谓当时应该在南京工作，而不是苏州。\n这名网友后来也感叹说：“《梦华录》的编剧就和我们这些普通观众一样，没有明白北宋阶官的制度，望文生义，认为苏州刺史就是苏州的官员，皇城副使就是皇城司的领导。这也是难免的，感觉只有专业人才能弄明白。”这名网友曾经对北宋奇特的官制产生了兴趣，在豆瓣友邻的鼓励下断断续续读了一些科普书籍。那么问题来了，有哪些能打通两宋与当下，专业与科普的书籍呢？或许《在田野看见宋朝》就是其中一本。包伟民先生在本书引言中，就诚恳地认为学术研究应当“走出‘专业’的圈子，以使历史知识能够走近更多的读者”。\n《在田野看见宋朝》，包伟民等著，浙江古籍出版社2022年8月出版。图源：浙江古籍出版社微信公众号\n就我个人而言，这本书之所以吸引我，在于提供了历史长河的锚点。这锚点，可以是距离我家不远的忠亭，可以是我多次穿越而过的鼓楼，可以是陆游的“深巷明朝卖杏花”，也可以是王安石在鄞县（今宁波）的新政实验。刘成国先生评价王安石时说：“所谓参天之木，必有其根；怀山之水，必有其源。”今天杭州背后的江南韵味、世代匠心，很大程度上来自两宋，而我们借助“锚点”回望两宋，也自有一股独特趣味。\n一手材料\n知乎上有网友提问说普通的中文系学生是否有阅读繁体竖排本古籍的必要。有一名网友…",

          "description": "起因：加班太多，病倒了\n之前公司赶项目进度，我所在的团队两个月无休连轴转，导致身体负荷太大，生了一场小病。医生的诊断是免疫系统出了问题，虽然对日常生活影响不大，但可能无法根治，只能慢慢调理。从诊室走出来后，我立即将「保持身体健康」这件事的优先级「置顶」了，决定开始改变以前一些不健康的生活习惯。\n除了调整作息、加强锻炼，也开始研究日常的营养摄入。但是关于营养，我除了知道几个类似「高油、高糖、高盐要少吃」、「卡路里超标会肥胖」、「高蛋白可以增肌」的碎片化概念，似乎也没有更加深入的认知了，一时有点无从下手。\n于是我决定先从书里找找答案。\n灵感：从食物多样性入手\n在豆瓣的书单和评分榜上一番搜寻，我注意到了《你是你吃出来的》这本书。看完之后，书里提到的一个概念让我印象深刻：人类是杂食动物，吃得不够全面，是营养失衡最常见的诱因。\n1.身体器官出毛病，主要是因为细胞损伤得快，修复得慢。\n人体内的细胞都是在以固定的速度更新换代，比如血管的内皮细胞 1 天就会死亡；胃黏膜细胞 3 ～ 5 天更替一次；肺表面的细胞寿命是 2 ～ 3 周。当细胞修复的速度高于损伤速度，就是健康的，「青黄不接」则容易出毛病。\n2.上述过程所需的「原材料」，唯一来源就是日常摄入的食物。\n虽然生病后吃药可以抑制、缓解症状，但并没有根本上改变细胞更新的平衡。更合理的方式是通过日常饮食提供充分的「原材料」，让细胞更新的平衡有序地运转下去。\n3.人体所需的营养元素十分庞杂，很难靠少数几种食物就满足。\n比如上皮组织，如果人体内缺乏胶原蛋白，细胞之间的缝隙会加大，上皮细胞的保护功能就会减弱，管腔中的血液就会渗透出去，形成皮下出血。比如摄碘不足或者过量都将影响甲状腺功能，造成甲状腺的损伤。不同的身体器官，所需要的营养元素不尽相同，综合起来，身体所需的营养是个相当复杂的集合。如果日常只是摄入少数几种食物，就容易导致营养「偏科」，被忽视掉的营养元素可能导致某些器官的细胞更新的失衡。反之，吃得越杂，营养越容易均衡。\n《中国居民膳食指南 2022 》中也有类似的建议。《指南》共有8条核心准则，其中第一条就是「食物多样，合理搭配」，并明确建议「平均每天摄入12种以上食物，每周25种以上」。\n来源：《中国居民膳食指南》官网\n动手：「吃得杂」简单易行，但似乎没有趁手的工具\n作为一个打工人，我认为「吃得杂」的策略十分可行。一方面，我不仅仅满足于吃得饱、吃得爽，必须要提升下日常营养摄入的质量。另一方面，又也不想在营养搭配上花太多的精力，比如研究某些“神奇食物”、详细规划每一餐的卡路里、食物成分等等。「吃得杂」的策略就成了质量和效率的平衡之选。\n \n「每周25种」开始成为我的饮食准则。\n我开始有意每餐都吃一些不一样的食物，降低自己的营养「偏科」风险。 做起来似乎其实不难，菜市场买得到的，或者快餐能点的，随便组合下基本就能达到。 但这个策略执行了一段时间，我发现总是记不住这周吃了多少种。\n为了记录饮食，我也尝试了几个现有的应用，但要么功能太庞杂，各种 Banner 、营销推送满屏飞，要么记录成本太高，功能太偏向专业用户，比如要记录食物的重量、卡路里等等参数，而实际上我并不需要这么精确的食物成分管理。\n我既想知道自己有没有做到「食物多样」，又不想在这 [记录] 这个环节耗费太多的精力。既然工具不趁手，就自己做一个。\n「杂食记」——帮你达成「每周25种」的健康膳食目标\n \n量化当周的膳食目标达成进度，以及基本的种类分布。\n\n记录时只需要记下种类，不需要输入其他繁琐的参数。\n\n分析饮食数据，帮你更了解自己的饮食偏好，同时支持小组件。\n提供分析图表，并支持小组件\n可通过食物库管理食物，内置了常见的食物，当然你也可以自定义添加。\n\n按日期查询每一天的详细记录，当然也可以删除。\n\n其他小功能：定时提醒，帮你养成记录习惯；自定义每周膳食目标，给自己「加码」\n\n希望大家一起好好吃饭\n调理营养可能是个很复杂的事情，你我身上也背了很多责任和限制，没法做到永远把「营养调理」摆在第一优先级，但我们也许可以从好好吃饭开始，日常习惯做一点微小的改变，就能帮身体的营养维持该有的平衡。希望我的 App 可以帮大家迈出第一步，从「每周吃够25种」开始，变得更加健康。\n关于App的其他\n\n目前是买断制，另外App内有打赏页面，各位用得顺手可随缘投喂。\n发布才一个多月，功能和体验还在持续优化进步中。大家有任何建议或吐槽都可以通过站内信或者App内的邮件地址联系我。\nBug一定马上改，但功能不会随便加，尤其是与「每周25种」无关的功能会更加谨慎。同时，我觉得除了记录、查看分析之外并，大家没有必要在这个App中停留太久，希望做到「真·用完即走」、「真·小而美」。",

          "description": "这个周末又被封在家里了，去不了咖啡厅工作，客厅里唯一的办公位被麦嫂占领，两个孩子也很无聊，跑老跑去不得消停。于是，我也选择躺平了，一天睡两觉，醒了就刷视频、看电影。但偶尔又会想起公司的事；疫情各地物流受阻，电商收入又要受到影响；定好的品牌视频拍摄，可能又要因为疫情而延期；想着想着，心中又开始焦虑了，就这样在躺平、焦虑，焦虑、躺平之间反反复复，心情更差了。\n其实回头想想，在整个创业过程中，这点焦虑都属于家常便饭，但大部分人可能会困在焦虑之中，难以自拔。今天就聊聊我曾经最焦虑的几个阶段，也许能给大家一点参考吧。\n2015 年，为了公司业务转型，我开始尝试寻找投资人。性格内向且缺乏经验的我，除了要面对外部的各种质疑，还有应对内部的复杂关系，老股东该如何安顿？合伙人该怎样分配？每一次谈话，每一次邮件发出之后，都会让我无比焦虑。那段时间，我经常无意识的在街上暴走，或者去海边呐喊宣泄，情绪一直处于过山车状态，非常抑郁。直到融资搞定之后，我安排的第一件事是去医院做了全面体检，特别担心身体会出现大问题。\n焦虑归焦虑，真正解决问题的方法，还是要不停的尝试，通过理性沟通处理各方的诉求，该留的留，该走的走。突破自己原有的圈层，放开性格包袱，去寻找更多的可能性。所以，最终的融资不是来自投资公司，而是来自客户、同行和用户。\n2017 年，迎来了又一次创业考验，好不容易融到的一点钱，很快就花完了，马上就要进入发不出工资的窘境。现在想想其实也怪自己，拿到投资的一年时间里，过度的沉醉于资本市场逻辑当中，把大部分精力放在 BP 故事里，忽略了公司管理和业务聚焦，且一度自我感觉良好。\n此刻摆在眼前只有两条路：要么想尽一切办法支撑下去，要么选择清算并关闭公司。但这两条路都很难。不能再指望外人援助，靠自己就只能抵押房子，一旦失败，全家归零。想想已经积累数年的内容、用户、品牌，如果选择结束，也很难再有这样的机会了。何况我们确实做着正确且有价值的事情，只是我们还没有掌握更好的商业模式。\n一边筹措资金，一边送走部分团队，一边重新走出去约见客户。让客户了解我们的内在价值，哪怕是很小的客户，哪怕没有预算也无所谓，做好服务，以真诚换真诚。因为有前面的积累，加上团队的努力，半年之后，公司就能自己运转了。\n2020 年，公司业务已经稳定了，且略有盈余，我也终于还完了大部分贷款，总算可以轻装上阵。没想到春节刚过，新冠疫情全面爆发，全体成员隔离在家。刚刚起步的电商业务，直接就休克，客户拜访计划也全都暂停。说内心不慌是不可能的，焦虑情绪也开始了，但天灾面前，似乎也没什么办法。\n既然公司业务上没办法，就做点力所能及的事吧。无意间在工作群里发现了疫况小程序，可以通过地图定位周边疫情风险，我仔细研究发现是之前认识的开发者做的，聊天一问才知道，他也正在发愁中，数据录入、服务器压力，马上就撑不住了。于是我立刻动员了产品开发团队，参与到这个小程序的支持中，重构界面、扩容服务器、招募数据志愿者、紧急制作疫情科普防护内容，每天熬十几个小时，连续一周，竟然把这个小服务提供给三千万人。\n这段时间的无偿投入，虽然没有多少商业收益，却让更多人知道了少数派的存在，展现了团队的价值观，也间接验证了优质内容的多重价值。\n经过这些事情之后，我个人的抗焦虑能力算是大幅提升，并且也建立了应对原则。人非圣贤，孰能无虑，适当的放低预期，知足常乐。另一方面，既然焦虑不可避免，就不要轻易放弃思考和行动。要知道宏观环境下，很多问题都是阶段性和周期性的，它总会过去或者从头再来，但你的人生经历只有一次，你的行动将决定自己未来的走向。不管有多焦虑，都应该先选择承担起当下的责任，因为转机就发生在这个过程之中。\n换个角度来看，这世界上还有很多人，正在面对着各种生存、病痛、离别、各种不可逆转的人生变故，他们可能都还没有焦虑的机会，相对来说，我们依然属于幸运的多数派了。",

          "description": "@Anes and I started esims.io as a side project after using an eSIM for the first time and thinking how crazy it was to be able to \"download a SIM card\". We are convinced eSIM, aka \"embedded SIM\" is the technology that will lead to the end of crazy roaming fees and long waits at the airport sim card shop.\n\nWith the iPhone 14 announced as the first eSIM only iPhone, we're happy to release esims.io. We offer a powerful yet simple experience for anyone that needs a travel eSIM: we aggregate 4000+ data plans from telecom providers in 200+ countries in our seamless comparison interface.\n\nHere's a highlight of some of esims.io's best features so far: \n- Find plans by country, region, or with global coverage\n- Multi-country search: search for data plans compatible in multiple countries \n- Price/GB: sort offers by how expensive is a gigabyte of data\n- Filtering options: select how much data you need, and for how long\n- Currency conversions: local plans priced in local currencies are converted to the user's preferred currency\n- Multi-lingual experience: you should not have to speak english to stay connected while traveling: we're solving this trough our multi-lingual interface\n\nWhat's coming-up:\n- More supported languages\n- Buying eSIM plans directly from our website\n- A refresh of our mobile Apps\n\nThank you for checking us out ! We are of course welcoming feedback.\n\nValentin & Anes, Co-Founders of esims.io\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
