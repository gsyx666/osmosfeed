It provides multiple layers of autoscaling functionality: a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) and a vertical pod autoscaler (VPA) as a pod and a cluster autoscaler as a node.\nHowever, setting up cluster autoscaling with existing Kubernetes solutions can be difficult and restrictive. For example, in an AWS EKS cluster, you cannot manage nodes directly. Instead, we need to use additional orchestration mechanisms such as node groups. Suppose we have defined t3.large as instance type of nodegroup. When a new node needs to be provisioned for the cluster, Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler creates a new instance of type t3.large, regardless of resource requirements.

Still, many organizations remain hesitant to embrace the idea, either because the benefits are not understood well or because it’s seen as too difficult to change current processes.\nWhile technology teams implement the shift-left approach, it requires support from management to allow teams the flexibility to move into this way of operating.

This prompted them to create what I like to refer to as “general purpose” UI frameworks, which included the likes of Bootstrap and Material Design.

          "description": "我们经常交替使用人工智能（AI）、机器学习（ML）和深度学习（DL）这些术语，尽管我们几乎每天都阅读或听到它们。本文解释了这些技术是如何演变的以及它们有何不同。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n人工智能Artificial Intelligence（AI）、机器学习Machine Learning（ML）和深度学习Deep Learning（DL）通常可以互换使用。但是，它们并不完全相同。人工智能是最广泛的概念，它赋予机器模仿人类行为的能力。机器学习是将人工智能应用到系统或机器中，帮助其自我学习和不断改进。最后，深度学习使用复杂的算法和深度神经网络来重复训练特定的模型或模式。\n\r\n让我们看看每个术语的演变和历程，以更好地理解人工智能、机器学习和深度学习实际指的是什么。\n\r\n人工智能\n\r\n自过去 70 多年以来，人工智能已经取得了长足的进步。无论我们是否知道，也不管喜欢与否，，它已经渗透到了我们生活的方方面面。在过去十年中，机器学习和深度学习的进步已经在各种规模的行业和组织中创造了人工智能热潮。云服务提供商通过开发免费的开源服务和提供新的场景进一步推动的这种势头。\n\r\n\n\r\n人工智能可能是自 1956 年以来最受关注的概念。到 2015 年，GPU 的广泛使用使并行处理更快、更强大、更便宜。而愈加廉价的存储可以大规模地存储大数据（从纯文本到图像、映射等）。这产生了对数据分析的需求，它被更普遍地称为数据科学data science，导致机器学习发展为实现人工智能的方法。\n\r\n机器学习\n\r\n机器学习是使用算法来处理、学习和理解或预测可用数据的模式。最近，软件开发的低代码和无代码概念被用作机器学习中的自学习过程，它给出了完成特定任务的特定指令。通过使用数据和算法对机器进行“训练”，使其能够学习如何执行任务，更重要的是，将学习应用到不断发展的过程中。\n\r\n\n\r\n机器学习是在开发者社区专注于 AI 时发展起来的，然后发展了算法决策树学习、逻辑编程、聚类、并行处理和强化学习。这些都是朝着正确方向迈出的良好一步，但不足以解决世界感兴趣的场景。\n\r\n深度学习\n\r\n深度学习是神经网络和机器学习的进化，是人工智能社区的创意。它学习了人类思维在特定场景中的工作方式，然后在这项工作上比人类做得更好！例如，IBM 的 Watson 与自己下国际象棋，并在游戏中取得了很大进步，最终击败了世界冠军。谷歌的 AlphaGo 也学会了如何玩围棋游戏，一遍又一遍地玩它以提高自己，并成为冠军。\n\r\n人工智能、机器学习和深度学习正在不断发展。参与数据科学的每个人都希望推进这些概念以改善我们的日常生活。而开源社区、私营企业、科学家和政府机构都在为此共同努力。\n\r\n\n\r\n总而言之，虽然 AI 有助于创建智能机器，但机器学习有助于构建 AI 驱动的应用。深度学习是机器学习的一个子集。它通过利用复杂算法处理大量数据来训练特定模型。由于狭义 AI 极难开发，机器学习正在通过刚性计算解决这一领域的机遇。至少对于实现通用 AI，深度学习有助于将 AI 和机器学习结合在一起。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/08/ai-ml-and-dl-whats-the-difference/\n\r\n作者：Bala Kalavala 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "美国巡回法庭裁决专利发明人必须是人类\n\r\n美国联邦巡回上诉法庭上周裁决，专利发明人必须是人类。专利法中的术语“个人”指的是人类，因此 AI 不能申请作为专利发明人。这一裁决与澳大利亚、欧盟和英国法院的裁决相同。除非美国最高法院介入此类专利案件，联邦巡回上诉法庭的判决就是终判了。律师表态计划上诉到最高法院，认为上诉法庭对专利法采用了过于狭窄的定义，排除 AI 的发明将会产生负面影响。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Solidot\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我也觉得不该授予 AI 专利，毕竟 AI 是受控于人的。这就像你不能将工资给电脑，而是应该给使用电脑的人类。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nMeta 的 AI 聊天机器人已经被玩坏\n\r\nMeta 上周五公布了它的 AI 聊天机器人 BlenderBot 3，和微软在 2016 年发布的聊天机器人 Tay 一样，上线数天它就被人类玩坏了，成为了阴谋论狂热者，并对 Meta CEO 扎克伯格出言不逊。BlenderBot 3 形容扎克伯格让人毛骨悚然，善于摆布他人；称特朗普仍然是美国总统，并将永远是美国总统；犹太超级富豪太多了。Meta 承认聊天机器人会说一些冒犯人的话，表示它仍然处于开发之中。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Solidot\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：AI 本身没有世界观和价值观，所以被玩坏的 AI 只是一面片面地被误导了的镜子？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n英特尔“坚不可摧”的 SGX 再次被攻破\n\r\nSGX 旨在为加密密钥和其他敏感数据的安全保管提供某种堡垒，即使操作系统或运行在上面的虚拟机被恶意破坏。SGX 的安全性和真实性保证的关键是它创建了所谓的“飞地”，即安全内存块。“飞地”的内容在离开处理器之前就被加密并写入内存中。它们只有在返回后才会被解密。SGX 是许多公司向用户提供安全保证的基石。例如，Signal 用于处理联系人发现的服务器，依靠 SGX 来确保该过程是匿名的。但英特尔最新一代的 CPU 被发现包含一个漏洞，允许攻击者获得加密密钥和其他由该公司的软件防护扩展保护的机密信息。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：ARS Technica\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：所有理论上安全的措施，其实都有可能因为某些原因失效。",

          "description": "经济独立后，我很快发现自己之前的消费方式需要调整。\n我之前买东西几乎没有计划，大部分是偶发性的，也有很多冲动购买。其次，我对价格有些不敏感，总觉得平台上是这个价格那就这样吧；对很多产品的质量也没有概念，常常不知道该从何判断。比如买水果，我都是让商家随机装一些就过秤拿走。我也很少考虑买东西之后的处置行为，比如多久该把东西淘汰，日用品一般要屯多久等等。\n我逐渐觉得，我应该花些心思调整自己的生活和消费——我需要一个能让我在「重复购买」「快速更迭」的商品上省钱，可以为生活长远算计的在线平台。1688 就这样进入了我的视野。\n1688 建立的初衷是为批发商或者商户找到合适的生产商，由于平台允许商户购买样品，所以个人消费者也可以在 1688 上进行购买。在 1688 平台进行了大半年采买后，我想和大家分享一下我的购物体验和购物感受，也欢迎各位朋友分享你的「批发」心得。\n本文分享的所有产品和卖家均是来自于自己及朋友购买经历，不含有任何广告或者宣传。\n在 1688 购物的原因\n在 1688 购物主要就是为了两方面：规划预算省钱，适量囤货日用。1688 正好在这两点都是强项。\n各大社交平台都有博主提过，同款的产品，其他购物平台基本价格一致，而 1688 上可以便宜一半甚至是更多。因为 1688 上的卖方是生产商，少了很多分销渠道的成本和加价。这也是为什么 1688 会有很多东西便宜到让人惊讶的原因，毕竟「要批发，上 1688」。\n举个例子，我在南方经常要用的除湿袋，在 1688 上的价格是 0.7 元一包，购买超过 250 包，会便宜到 0.68 元。而在当地超市买到的同款至少一包 2 元，有些网购平台甚至要 5 元一包。\n这是我楼下超市卖的同款，非常好用，五块钱一包。\n偶尔一包可能价格差距不大，但这种除湿袋我每年都会用掉很多，累计起来就不在少数了，带上全寝室批发则开销更大。类似的还有袜子、…",

          "description": "「记录」这件事就是非常有威力，它会把注意力之外的小细节收集起来，给予一种确实发生但又意料之外的生活视角。比如如果不是记账，我不知道原来每个月会支出那么多零零碎碎的「拿铁因子」；如果不是 HiWater，我也不会知道原来自己摄入那么多含糖饮料。\n其实我很早之前就购买过 WaterMinder 这款 App Store Editors's Choice 应用，只是彼时的我并不明白「多喝水」三个字对身体的意义，同时也觉得记录喝水这件事就像是记账——没有外部约束、「记录多少全凭诚实美德」的记录只在于自我娱乐。所以往往三天后意兴阑珊删除了事。\nHiWater 则是好友 @特伦 推荐的，把玩了下觉得还不错，但当时并不想为这个需求掏钱；不久前确诊痛风后，离开诊室满心灰暗的我有了「每天喝水 3L+」的刚需，这才发现这款应用的每一个付费点都值得我掏钱。\n作为一款国产应用，HiWater 的饮品目录预设种类都比较契合日常，并且在目录处还醒目地标注了每 100 毫升所带有的千卡热量。向下翻阅到高热量饮品时甚至有一种黑名单的既视感。\n\n如此设计的部分原因是，HiWater 采用了「饮水金字塔」模型，它将所有饮品归在六个等级内，并依此建议每日摄入的比例。此模型虽有哈佛大学公共卫生学院专家的背书，总体指导思想依然是鼓励大家多喝白水，减少摄入高糖、甚至是含糖饮料。\n关联阅读：如何合理控制糖分摄入\n\n对喝水提醒应用来说，我们一般会面临预设饮品难以覆盖真实世界情况的问题。\n所以在 HiWater 中我们也可以新增或编辑饮品类目到「饮水金字塔」模型中，把某个模糊的品类变成精确的单品。比如说 HiWater 预设了椰子水这个饮品，但我日常喝得比较多的是山姆椰子水，那我就直接编辑成山姆椰子水的营养成分，并重新归类到低卡饮料分类中去；再比如我喝的柠檬水是浓缩液和水 1:10 冲兑而来，因此我也通过计算将预设的「柠檬水」编辑成「自制柠檬水」，并由浓缩液计算出对应的热量。\n当然，手动编辑多了我们自然就会想：这些外包装上带有营养成分表的商品饮料，如何快捷记录到应用内？\nHiWater 的答案是「直接用相机扫」，请直接看这个动图：\n\n我猜测可能 Apple 在系统中给了 OCR 相关的 API，开发者就取来做这个功能了。这是我最喜欢的功能，实际使用起来识别比动图中要更迅速，识别率高且稳定。偶尔可能会有一些识别错误，比如把 ≥ 识别成 2，但我也能原谅。\n如此一来，在机场购买的农夫山泉力量帝柠檬水、屯了两箱的兰芳园低糖冻柠茶，都可以统统扫入我的饮品目录。记录时也可以根据自己的实际情况调整，比如冻柠茶虽是低糖，我还是会将它兑冰水或柠檬水喝，因此我的喝水记录里经常会出现 50 毫升的冻柠茶、紧接着出现 200 毫升的水或柠檬水。\n\n之前做手冲咖啡用的秤，现在大多被我用于称水喝，但后续我发现只要记住水倒在杯子上的花纹位置，不用秤也能大致知道这杯水的量。以名创优品的 580 毫升容积的可乐杯为例，杯内两道凹痕，分别可以粗略看作是 200/500 毫升的刻度。在公司喝水，可以考虑在工位启用大杯子装水，之前因为杯子小+次数少，上班时喝水太少。一周下来，确实每日喝水 3.3L 以上。\n\n其余的基础功能，诸如弹出提醒用户喝水、身体水分的简单预估、根据用户情况估算需要摄入的水量等，我就不一一展开了，WaterMinder 也有，我认为这些是一款「喝水类」App 都应该做的免费功能。其实我原先也是想通过快捷指令自己做一个提醒和记录每日喝水的应用，这不难，我甚至已经做好了 社死版快捷指令 定时运行，但体验过 HiWater 的一些交互后，我最后决定不折腾自己了。\n应用内还有不少花心思的交互和设计\nHiWater 多样的桌面小组件，还支出快捷录入饮品，打破了我对 iOS 小组件「能看不能用」的固有认知（我原先在 iOS 上并不使用任何 Widget，这一下就微上瘾了，顺带一口气添加了其余应用的小组件 xD）。\n精美的 Widget，支持快捷录入\nHiWater 采用免费下载+内购解锁的付费机制，如果你看完文章对它感兴趣，安装来把玩把玩也可以。如果想要为它付费的话，建议先确认自己有强烈的督促自己喝水的需求，然后订阅一个月试试——我直接买断是因为意识到「多喝水」这样的生活我可能要持续好几个月，甚至好几年，本身并不是很理性的消费习惯。\n如果一个应用能够帮助我长期维持某个健康习惯，我愿意给出「十刀买断，天大划算」的评价；如果没有，我也会用「三分钟热度三分钟收获」来安慰自己。\n> 下载 少数派 2.0 客户端、关注 少数派公众号，解锁全新阅读体验 📰\n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀",

          "description": "自《PasteNow for iOS 正式发布》后，已有三个月没有介绍 PasteNow 了。这三个月，PasteNow 也没有停止进化的脚步，分别迭代了 2.1、2.2 和 2.3 这几个版本，其中 2.3 于今天刚刚发布。本篇即是汇总一下过去三个月 PasteNow 的发展与变化。\n支持 Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴\n正如标题所说，2.3 版本带来了「Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴」的功能。这是 PasteNow 迄今为止非常重要的一个改进，不仅带来更加一致的体验，同时也大大提升效率。解决这个问题其实有点周折，我先简单地补充一下背景：\n\nWord 和 Pages，因为其固有机制的原因（也许是 Bug），它不支持剪贴板的多项目粘贴。也就说是，往剪贴板里写入多项内容，再在 Word 里操作粘贴，你会发现只有第一个内容粘贴了进去，但是如果同样在备忘录（或其他 App）里操作粘贴，是会出现多个内容的。\n\nPasteNow 的用户最早在去年7月就给我汇报了这个问题，当时我发现是 Word 和 Pages 的固有机制导致的问题后，决定暂时观察一段时间，因为也许 Word 在更新后会「修复」这个问题。\n但是等了很久，这个行为始终没有发生变化，看来确实是固有机制的限制了。正好最近又有用户汇报了相关问题，我换了一下思路，看看能不能从 PasteNow 这边做点什么的方式来解决这个问题。于是还真让我找到了一个办法。\n假如你是 Word、Pages 等的重度用户，经常需要粘贴内容至 Word、Pages 里，特别是一次性粘贴多项内容，现在通过 PasteNow 可以更好的做到这些了。请看视频！\n \n更加全面和完善的快捷键体验\n作为一个效率工具，能100%通过快捷键来达成各种操作一直是 PasteNow 重点优化的方向。在过去几个版本中，PasteNow 加强了以下两方面的快捷键体验：\n\n支持将 F1～F12 录制成快捷键了，这意味着可以用更加轻松的「单键」来达成 PasteNow 的各项操作；\n支持通过按下“@、%、$”等特殊符号也进入快速搜索模式；\n「添加标题」和「编辑文本」操作，也有了专属快捷键，分别是：Command + T 和 Command + E。\n\n相信通过以上快捷键的改进，使用 PasteNow 的过程将更加流畅。\niOS 版本的变化\n三个月前的主要事件是 iOS 版本的发布，过去三个月，iOS 版本发展的怎么样呢？这里不得不承认一个事实，这个版本并没有达到各种预期，无论是我作为开发者的预期，还是用户对它的预期。\n首先是我作为开发者的预期，目前 iOS 版本的用户非常少，日活跃用户最多时仅为 macOS 版本的 1/15。相当于 15 个 macOS 版本用户才对应 1 个 iOS 版本。这其实也是在我的预期中，但没想到会差这么多。\n另一方面是作为用户的预期，很多用户对这款 iOS 产品寄予了厚望，以为也可以像 macOS 版本一样做到后台记录剪贴板内容、实时同步剪贴板数据。但事实是这个从 iOS 的机制上就做不到，并且在即将发布的 iOS 16 里，对剪贴板的操作将会进一步变得更难。\n以上当然不是用户预期的问题，而是我在打造这款产品时没有准确的传达信息导致的，后续在 iOS 版本中，我将增加一个 FAQ 模块，让用户可以非常直观地了解到这个工具能做什么，不能做什么等等。\n当然，我依然会尽力去完善 iOS 版本的体验，使其与 macOS 的基本功能靠近，比如在 2.3 版本当中，图片类的数据，现在也可以通过长按保存至相册了。这个是会比较实用且基础的一个操作。\n小结\nPasteNow 从 1.0 发布到今天，不过一年又三个多月，它依然是一款年轻的产品，我会继续按照既定节奏去稳步迭代，不断完善它的体验与其他 App 的互操作能力。\n希望它继续给大家带来愉悦的效率之旅～\n附：少数派下载与购买链接。\n \n \n演示：PasteNow 2.3 多项目粘贴至 Word",

          "description": "Beanvest on Product Hunt!\n\nWhy build an investment portfolio tracker?\nAs many investors do, I wanted to keep track of my stocks portfolio and did it with a spreadsheet. However, it becomes harder when you want to do things more accurately (for example, it's hard to really calculate your PRU without taking into account currency fluctuations), you need to easily track dividends or measure your real performance.\nI then created Beanvest, first only as a tool for myself but thought it might be useful to other investors. Now, Beanvest supports more than 250,000 assets including stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, bonds and cryptocurrencies, and it's time to share it with you the world!\n\nYour stocks portfolio vs S&P 500: are you making good decisions?\nThe most important question of all for any stocks investor is probably \"Are you outperforming the market?\". Otherwise, why bother picking stock when you can just buy index funds?\n\nBeanvest allows you to answer this question easily by showing you your portfolio performance over time versus any other investment (for example your portfolio VS S&P 500) by simulating what your portfolio would have been.\n\nIn each portfolio, you will see other useful information such as allocation charts by asset type, sector, industry, country... as well as the latest news for each asset. \n\nMany more tools for investors\nBeanvest comes with other tools for investors. You can see information on each asset (financials, EPS beats, dividends, etc...) or use the free Discounted Cash Flow calculator to estimate the fair value of stocks.\n\n💬 Please share your feedback!\nI'd be super pumped if you try Beanvest and leave me some feedback!\n\nThere are many features I want to build and would love to hear your thoughts.\n\nThank you ❤️\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
