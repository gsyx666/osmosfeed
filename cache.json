It is the equivalent of skipping a class in elementary school, going straight from 4th grade to 6th grade, due to learning so fast, that 5th grade is not relevant anymore.\nWhen a frog leap occurs in innovation, it changes how we must use historical data to predict the trajectory of the future. When frog leaps are due, existing survival mechanisms are typically counter productive, and often causes more harm than good. The best analogy and example of this is paradoxically the Dodo.\n\nThe Dodo was a bird in Mauritius that had grown huge in size as a part of its survival mechanism. As a consequence of its growth, it lost the ability to fly. For millions of years this was the best strategy for the Do…",

          "description": "组织层面的自动化一直是一个难以实现的目标，但 Kubernetes 或许能够改变这一切。\n\r\n\r\n当我在 2002 年采用 Gentoo Linux 作为我的主要操作系统时，我开始了我的自动化之旅。二十年后，自动化还没有完成。当我与客户和合作伙伴会面时，他们分享了团队内部的自动化成果，但他们也描述了在组织层面实现类似成功所面临的挑战。\n\r\n大多数 IT 组织都能够端到端地提供虚拟机，从而将过去 4 周的交付周期缩短到仅 5 分钟。这种级别的自动化本身就是一个复杂的工作流程，需要网络（IP 地址管理、DNS、代理、网络区域等）、身份访问管理、虚拟机管理程序、存储、备份、更新操作系统、应用最新的配置文件、监控、安全和强化以及合规性基准测试，等等。哇，这么多！\n\r\n满足高速、可扩展和按需自动化的业务需求并不容易。例如，来看看经典的网上商店或提交纳税申报表的在线政府服务，其工作负载有明确的峰值需要面对。\n\r\n处理此类负载的一种常见方法是拥有一个超大的服务器集群，以供 IT 专业人员的特定团队使用，监控客户或公民的季节性涌入。每个人都希望及时部署整个栈。他们希望基础架构在混合云场景的上下文中运行工作负载，使用“构建-消耗-回收build-consume-trash”模型来优化成本，同时从无限弹性中受益。\n\r\n换句话说，每个人都想要乌托邦式的“云体验”。\n\r\n云真的能交付吗？\n\r\n尚有一线机会，这主要归功于 Kubernetes 的设计方式。Kubernetes 的指数级普及推动了创新，取代了管理平台和应用的标准传统做法。 Kubernetes 需要使用 “万物皆代码Everything-as-Code”（EaC）来定义从简单的计算节点到 TLS 证书的所有资源的期望状态。Kubernetes 强制使用三种主要的设计结构：\n\r\n\r\n一个标准接口，以减少内部和外部组件之间的整合问题\n\r\nAPI 优先及仅 API 的方法来标准化其所有组件的 CRUD（创建、读取、更新、删除）操作\n\r\n使用 YAML 作为通用语言，以简单易读的方式定义这些组件的所有所需状态\n\r\n\r\n这三个关键组成部分基本上是选择自动化平台的相同要求，至少如果你想让跨职能团队轻松采用是这样的。这也模糊了团队之间的职责分工，有助于提高跨越孤岛的协作，这是一件好事！\n\r\n事实上，采用 Kubernetes 的客户和合作伙伴正在加速进入超自动化状态。Kubernetes 有机地推动团队采用多种 DevOps 基础和实践，如：EaC、使用 Git 进行版本控制、同行评审、文档即代码Documentation as Code，并鼓励跨职能协作。这些实践有助于提高团队的自动化技能，并帮助团队在处理应用生命周期和基础架构的 GitOps 和 CI/CD 管道方面取得良好的开端。\n\r\n让自动化成为现实\n\r\n你没看错！网络商店或政府报告等复杂系统的整个栈可以用清晰、可理解、通用的术语定义，可以在任何本地或云提供商上执行。可以定义具有自定义指标的自动伸缩器以触发所需栈的即时部署，以解决季节性高峰期间客户或市民的涌入问题。当指标恢复正常，且云计算资源不再有存在的理由时，你将它们回收并恢复常规运营，而由一组核心资产在本地接管业务，直到下一次激增。\n\r\n鸡和蛋的悖论\n\r\n考虑到 Kubernetes 和云原生模式，自动化是必须的。但它提出了一个重要的问题：一个组织可以在解决自动化战略之前采用 Kubernetes 吗？\n\r\n似乎从 Kubernetes 开始可以激发更好的自动化，但这并不是一个一成不变的结论。工具不是对技能、实践和文化问题的解决方案。但是，设计良好的平台可以成为 IT 组织内学习、变革和跨职能协作的催化剂。\n\r\n开始使用 Kubernetes\n\r\n即使你觉得自己错过了自动化列车，也不要害怕从简单、不复杂的栈上开始使用 Kubernetes。当你 掌握了初始步骤，就可以拥抱这个出色的编排系统的简单性，并根据更复杂的需求进行迭代。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/10/kubernetes-solve-automation-challenges\n\r\n作者：Rom Adams 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "以下是我们安装 Ubuntu 22.10 “Kinetic Kudu”（GNOME 版）后，推荐做的 10 件事列表。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nUbuntu 22.10 带来了很多令人兴奋的新功能，例如 GNOME 43、最新的内核、重新设计的托盘菜单、文件应用的功能和 Pipewire 等 新功能。\n\r\n我相信你已经迫不及待地想尝试 Ubuntu 22.10 上的这些新功能了。\n\r\n但是请先等一等。\n\r\n在你前往享受你新安装的 Ubuntu 22.10 之前，我要向你推荐一个不容错过的 Ubuntu 定制技巧列表。\n\r\n安装 Ubuntu 22.10 后要做的 10 件事\n\r\n1、更新你的系统\n\r\n安装好 Ubuntu 22.10 后，第一件要做的事就是更新你的系统。因为时差的原因，最新的 ISO 镜像通常不会包括所有的系统更新。所以，你要打开一个终端窗口，并运行以下命令，来更新你的系统。\n\r\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade\r\n\n\r\n上述命令执行完成后，你就可以进行下一步啦。\n\r\n2、删除 Firefox Snap，并安装 Flatpak 或者 deb 版本的 Firefox\n\r\n自去年发布的 Ubuntu 21.10 版本以来，默认的网页浏览器 Firefox 开始以 Snap 软件包的形式出现。如果你是普通用户，这可能不是一个问题或者需要担心的事情。但是出于几个原因，例如 Snap 软件包的 Firefox 启动时间较长、且当 Firefox 有后台更新时，会有不必要的 Snap 更新通知等等原因，导致许多用户不太喜欢 Firefox 的 Snap 软件包。\n\r\n因此，你可以按照 我写的另一篇操作指南，来完全删除 Firefox 的 Snap 软件包。这一过程有点复杂，需要花费一点时间。删除完成后，再从个人软件包存档（PPA）安装 deb…",

          "description": "systemd 创始人认为 Linux 的启动并不安全\n\r\n已经加入了微软的 systemd 创始人 Lennart Poettering 认为，在启用了安全启动的硬件上，虽然启动过程（包括内核）是签名的，但下一步，即加载 initrd，却没有签名。他提议将 Linux 启动过程转移到加密签名的统一内核镜像，使用 TPM 2.0 硬件加强 Linux 系统启动过程的安全性。initrd 是“初始化内存磁盘”，恶意软件或入侵者可以在 initrd 中插入恶意代码，而且每次系统启动时都会加载该代码，即使该恶意代码的其他副本不存在于硬盘上。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：想法是很好，但是这就是一个不透明的盒子。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nLinux 内核开始为 800 Gbps 网络做准备\n\r\nIEEE 已经发布了 800Gbps 网络的标准，而英伟达正在开发 800Gbps 网络硬件，其 Linux 内核驱动的开发人员确认，下一代英伟达 Spectrum ASIC 将支持 800Gbps 的速度。虽然 800Gbps 已经是目前最高端的 400Gbps 带宽的两倍，但以太网联盟今年的路线图已经将 1.6Tbps 网络作为未来几年内的计划。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：Linux 内核在抛弃博物馆硬件的同时，越来越多的成为新硬件的第一批支持系统。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nFedora 40 正在为迁移到更现代的 C 语言标准做准备\n\r\n1999 年发布的 C 语言标准（C99）删除了一些向后兼容的特性，然而，GCC 仍然默认接受这些过时的构造。但对这些结构体的支持让程序员感到困惑，并有可能影响 GCC 实现未来 C 标准中的功能。计划 2024 年发布的 GCC 14 编译器，正在考虑默认禁用对传统 C 语言结构的支持。LLVM 的开发者也正在考虑可能比这更早地禁用传统的 C 语言结构。Fedora 40 计划更主动地发现那些仍然依赖传统 C 语言行为的开源项目，以在 GCC 14 前就消除对旧的 C 语言标准的支持。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：说是新的 C 语言标准，其实也有 20 多年了——都说程序员是喜新厌旧的，但是似乎都抱着自己用惯的语言不肯放手。",

          "description": "之前，我在《论文读不懂怎么办？》一文中，给你介绍了论文阅读遇到问题时的几个解决方法。尤其是介绍了你可以求助的免费资源和路径，它们包括但不限于：\n\n幻灯\n博客\n视频\n课程\n代码\n\n那篇文章，在知乎上获得了 2600 个赞（截止 2022 年 10 月）。我相信，对于很多同学，起到了帮助。\n\n只不过，环境和技术在变化，我们解决问题的方法和思路，也应该与时俱进。\n这不，因为有了大规模自然语言处理模型的加持，阅读论文时遇到不认识的名词，或者无法理解作者的简单解释时，我们有了一种新的对策。\n具体的方法，就是人工智能替你阅读后，把内容综合整理，结合上下文转换成简单清晰的语言，再反馈给你。\n这个想法，其实并不新鲜了。翻看近几年自然语言处理领域的论文，你能看见不少相关的研究。\n只不过，那些研究成果只存在论文中，或者是在某个实验室的电脑里面，普通人根本无法接触，更不要说利用了。\n这回可不一样，有人（ \\@amanjha__ and \\@functionofjade）居然真的就做了个产品出来。\n这个应用的名字，叫做 explainpaper ，非常直白吧？\n\n使用起来也特别方便。不用去菜单里面点选找寻。只要你把论文传上去，高亮某一个词语、短语或者段落，人工智能就会自动为你解读。\n\n不仅如此，你还可以就着 AI 反馈的结果，继续追问。\n这种应用演示不大适合图文。所以我干脆为你做了 一段演示视频，你可以先看看。\n \n \n看完之后，感受如何？\n反正不少小伙伴表示，很兴奋。\n\n这东西背后的技术是啥？当然还是咱们的老熟人 ------GPT-3.\n其实 GPT-3 这模型的特点，说穿了就是大。因为模型庞大，参数众多，所以从海量语料库里积攒的「认知」就多。注意我这里刻意回避了「知识」这个词儿。\n\n（资料来源：t.ly/cY1kn）\n从上图中，你不难看到，现在的文本和代码生成中，GPT-3 都占据了重要位置。\n我喜欢共享内容的原因之一，是视频发出后总可以获得观众进一步的反馈。不少的问题，都会激发我的思考。\n例如有小伙伴在视频后面提问，说这个东西能不能帮着理解中文论文啊？\n\n这是个很好的问题。毕竟很多国内人文社科研究生平时阅读的论文，更大比例是中文的。\n我一开始觉得这个问题问得有些太贪心了。对于一个外国人做的刚上线应用，你指望人家立即支持阅读中文，还能看懂中文的研究论文，不大现实吧？\n刚要回复，我突然想起来 上次在 Lex 上面的教训了。既然 explainpaper 的底层模型是 GPT-3 ，那它本来就该认得中文啊。\n为了确保回答准确，还是实际测试一下吧。我传了一篇自己的论文上去。\n\n中文划线高亮之后，AI 反馈的结果让我有些吃惊。\n尽管 explainpaper 并不能直接用中文来解释信息。但它可以立即识别出「知识管理」就是 knowledge management ，然后进一步解释下去。\n下面这段解释，就更有意思了。\n\n它先广泛解释「插件」是啥，然后结合本文的上下文，指出 Roam Toolkit 是一种插件，并且描述了它的功能。\n不仅如此，从下图可以看出，就连划线的时候字符之间出现了空格间隔，也依然能正常识别和解释。\n\n下面，我故意找了个文中没有进行详细解释的「概念网络」，结果是这样的。\n\n我能确定，这解释里面出现的「宠物」、「猫」、「狗」啥的，肯定没在本文正文出现过。\nEvernote 这一段，让我愣住了。\n\nExplainpaper 居然是准确识别了这张表格，并且把内容总结梳理，然后用英文输出了出来。\n上述的演示，是不是回答了读者的问题呢？我觉得算不上。从需求分析来看，人家看中文论文遇到术语不清楚，自然是需要中文的解释。你再弄成英文给我，这......\n可换个角度想想，这东西帮助外国人阅读中文论文，可是再好不过了。遇到中文专业词汇，随时可以获得准确的英文解释，而且阐述还贴合论文的上下文。外国人读中文论文，将减少很多障碍。这或许可以快速提升中文论文的影响力，妙啊！\n另外，目前 explainpaper 缺乏中文解释能力，也给国内的开发者提供了发展空间。希望早日看到更多 AI 实际应用上线，帮助国人理解中文论文。\n我期待你能自己尝试一下这款在线应用。至少在目前，它是免费的。而且因为上传的都是公开发表的论文，也不存在用户隐私泄漏问题。所以可以放心大胆地尝试 ------ 特别是对于最近要写文献综述的小伙伴来说。\n欢迎你把自己测试的结果和经验心得，分享在留言区。咱们一起交流讨论。\n祝论文阅读愉快！\n如果你觉得本文有用，请充电。\n如果本文可能对你的朋友有帮助，请转发给他们。\n欢迎关注我的专栏「科研利器」，以便及时收到后续的更新内容。\n \n \n延伸阅读\n如何高效入门 Logseq ？\n互联网上的时光机器\n如何高效学 Python？\nVOSviewer 中文视频教程\n【知识星球精选】刻意练习区的辅助线",

          "description": "灵动岛是今年iPhone的热点更新。我们在早期的时候，看到了很多针对灵动岛的玩法，比如在岛的周围养宠物、用灵动岛打游戏、适配灵动岛的挖孔壁纸等。\n但是，这些玩法从系统和功能层面，并没有用到真正的“灵动岛接口”。在苹果开发者文档中，灵动岛实际上是一种“实时活动”。在某些用户需要实时关注状态变化的场景下，为用户展示信息。比如实时更新比赛数据、实时更新外卖进度、实时更新计时器、实时更新地图导航指引等等。\n如果iPhone安装了iOS 16.1系统，在iPhone 14 Pro机型上，实时活动可以在灵动岛和锁屏界面展示；而在非iPhone 14 Pro机型，则只在锁屏界面展示。\n\nOneWidget如何定位灵动岛？\n仔细阅读苹果开发者文档之后，我们发现实时活动的实现方式和小组件有非常多重叠的地方。同时，不管在锁屏界面还是“展开的”灵动岛位置，它的尺寸都很像中尺寸的桌面小组件。再者，实时活动不能够交互、也不能有动画、不能随时刷新，这些和小组件都太像了。所以，我们最终把实时活动定位成“一种特殊的小组件”。\n当我们把“灵动岛”定义为“实时展示的小组件”，那么一切就更简单了，原则上小组件能够实现的它都可以实现。只是我们需要额外思考，在锁屏和灵动岛这两个特殊的位置，用户凭什么要展开来用它。\nOneWidget怎么做灵动岛功能？\n在迭代产品的2年多时间里，OneWidget的各种类型的小组件从用户那里得到了很多不错的回馈。当我们复盘这些小组件，用户最关心的是三个关键词：实用、美观、趣味。所以，设计灵动岛这个特殊的小组件，我们应该做的也是实用、美观、趣味。另外补充一点，对于很多用户来说，美观、趣味也是一种实用价值，美观带来个性化的装饰、趣味带来功能的尝鲜探索。\n从实用和便捷角度，我们设计了“启动之岛”和“健康之岛”。\n从美观和趣味角度，我们设计了“宠物之岛”和“摆烂之岛”。\n\n如何开启灵动岛？\n如果iPhone更新到iOS 16.1以上，下载OneWidget 的3.6.0以上的版本之后，可以进入个人中心找到主入口。在灵动岛配置页面，选择需要开启的“岛屿”，当App进入后台或者切换到其他App，实时活动就已经开启在了锁屏界面和灵动岛区域。\n配置入口我们还单独设计了一些细节：会动的海平面、开启后的彩色提示框、预览效果等。\n\n宠物之岛\n用户可以在“宠物之岛”领养一个自己的电子宠物，它每天陪你玩、会饿、会困、会渴，在不同的状态下用户需要点击不同的操作。我们给宠物取了一个名字叫做“岛岛”，领养之后，在App内还会显示领养的天数。岛岛除了不同的状态，也有可能会出去玩耍，只有等他回来才能再次跟他互动。为了满足个性化，宠物“岛岛”还允许自定义颜色，现在我们支持了7种颜色的切换。\n\n启动之岛\n“启动之岛”可以允许用户添加快速启动App或者小程序的入口，常驻在锁屏界面和灵动岛里，展开之后即可点击一键直达的App。用户可以添加1~6的常用启动入口，根据添加的数量变化，图标和间距会自动调整来适应合适的布局。和锁屏小组件、桌面小组件一行，这里的启动器入口支持添加常用的App、微信支付宝的二级路径、微信和支付宝的小程序入口。\n\n摆烂之岛\n“摆烂之岛”将随机展示一些“反鸡汤”的插画和文案。这个功能为了满足“趣味性”，该卷的时候卷，该躺的时候也要好好躺。偶尔摆烂无可厚非，休息是人之常情。\n\n健康之岛\n“健康之岛”实时展示用户当天的健康数据，比如步数、运动时间、消耗能量、身高、体重等。尤其是对于每日会更新变动的数据，是可以查看更新数据的（不过目前系统刷新问题，会有较多延迟）。\n\n \n以上就是OneWidget关于灵动岛功能的思考和功能的介绍。希望帮助大家了解灵动岛，也能够帮助大家通过这些小功能体验到灵动岛（实时活动）的用法。我们将继续做好一个“装修产品”，带来更多实用、美观、有趣的功能。\n回见。",

Similarly, Discord is a non-open source chat application that's also popular with many online communities. Discord, like Matrix, provides a chat client for all major platforms both mobile and desktop, so it's perfectly usable on Linux. However, it's not open source and so, given the choice, you might prefer to use Matrix. The good news is that when not given a choice for any reason, you can also use Matrix to interface with Discord by running a Matrix-to-Discord bridge. This article shows you how to set up and run a Python Matrix bot to bridge chat between a Matrix room and a Discord channel.\nRe…",

We see people struggling to find their data, make sense of the aggregation windows, compare datasets, etc...\n\nGrafana does not plug the gap for them, because it is mainly aimed at monitoring real-time stuff. Engineers need to interact in a much more interactive way with their test data.\n\nIn the past we solved these challenges with Marple for files. Today we bring the same UI to people using an Influx database! 🎉\n\nMarple powers up your InfluxDB, giving you\n- speed: optimised flux queries (up to 10x as fast!) \n- UX: no aggregate windows to worry about\n- engineering workflow: data exports, statistics, compare time ranges, …\n- projects: reuse plots and share interactively with your team\n\nThis makes InfluxDB + Marple a powerful combo for innovate teams.\n\n☝️ Can I try it?\n\nYes, please! This new feature is part of our free tier.\nSign up for free - no strings attached - at app.marpledata.com\nWe'd love to hear your feedback!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
