          "description": "以下是从 Linux 命令行自动编辑文件的一些提示和技巧。\n\r\n\r\n当我使用 Linux 命令行时，无论是在台式机上编写新程序还是在 Web 服务器上管理网站，我经常需要处理文本文件。Linux 提供了强大的工具，我可以利用这些工具来完成我的工作。我经常使用 sed，一个可以根据模式修改文本的编辑器。\n\r\nsed 代表 流编辑器Stream EDitor，它编辑文件中的文本并打印结果。使用 sed 的一种方法是识别一个字符串在文件中的几次出现，并将它们替换为不同的字符串。使用 sed 来处理文本文件的方式似乎是无穷无尽的，但我想分享一些使用 sed 来帮助我管理文件的方法。\n\r\n在 Linux 上搜索和替换文件中的文本\n\r\n要使用 sed，你需要使用一个正则表达式。正则表达式是定义模式的一组特殊字符。我最常使用 sed 的例子是替换文件中的文本。替换文本的语法如下：s/originaltext/newtext。s 告诉 sed 执行文本替换或交换出现的文本。在斜线之间提供原始文本和新文本。\n\r\n此语法将仅替换每行中第一次出现的 originaltext。要替换每个匹配项，即使在一行中原始文本出现了不止一次，要将 g 追加到表达式的末尾。例如：s/originaltext/newtext/g。\n\r\n要在 sed 中使用此表达式，请使用 -e 选项指定此正则表达式：\n\r\n$ sed -e 's/originaltext/newtext/g'\r\n\n\r\n例如，假设我有一个名为 game 程序的 Makefile 文件，该程序模拟了康威的《生命游戏》：\n\r\n.PHONY: all run clean\r\n\r\nall: game\r\n\r\ngame: game.o\r\n        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o game game.o $(LDFLAGS)\r\n\r\nrun: game\r…",

          "description": "在中国，有各种节日，有各种情人节。\n\r\n最早是从西方传来的所谓公历 2.14 的“情人节”，后来又有了 3.14 的“白色情人节”。然后，人们觉得这些节的洋味太重，何不把中国的农历七夕当成中国传统的情人节呢？而随着二次元一代，谐音梗也开始流行，不知道是谁滥觞，5.20 也被当成了一种情人节，因为谐音是“我爱您”。\n\r\n前几天，我的朋友 aulus Wren 跟我说，有位内核开发者在 Linux 内核邮件列表中向 Linus Torvalds 请求，将刚刚准备进位到 6.0 的版本号在 5.20 上停留一次，他认为这是一个在中国宣传 Linux 的好机会。就在前几天，Linus Torvalds 刚刚在邮件列表中 宣布 了 Linux 5.19 正式发布，并通告下一个版本准备“进位”到 6.0 了。\n\r\n说起来 Linux 内核的版本号，比较有意思的是从 3.0 开始主版本号就没有什么特别的意义，只是当次版本号太大时，Linus 觉得过大的数字会让他困扰，因此就“进位”到主版本号了。比如，2.6.39 之后就是 3.0，3.19 之后就是 4.0，4.20 之后就是 5.0（之所以没有在 4.19 就开始进位，也许是 Linus 忘记了）。所以，按照这种不严格的 20 进制，该进位了。\n\r\n这位名叫 Zhang Boyang（让我们称他为“张同学”）的内核开发者在内核邮件列表中向 Linus Torvalds 发起倡议：\n\r\n\r\n您能不能考虑使用 5.20 作为下一个 Linux 版本号，而不是 6.0。“5.20” 这个数字在中文中是一个文字游戏，代表 “我爱您”，所以 “Linux 5.20” 在中文中可以被读作 “我爱 Linux”。 \n\r\n\r\n他认为，这可以引起一些广泛传播，可以宣传 Linux。这个 消息 传播到国内后，褒贬不一，有人认为这是一件有趣的事情，可以向更多不了解 Linux 的人宣传 Linux；也有人认为，这事太无聊了。\n\r\n但是这封邮件并未带来什么影响，可能是它发出的时间恰逢周末，也没有得到 Linus Torvalds 的回复。\n\r\n眼看过去了一周，合并窗口接近关闭了，看来修改版本号这件事希望渺茫，张同学 再次发出 了他的倡议，请 Linus Torvalds 考虑给该版本一个命名：\n\r\n\r\n您能不能考虑将下一个 Linux 版本（5.20 或 6.0）命名为 “I love linux”？……即使下一个内核版本号是 6.0，我想对于讲中文的人和不讲中文的人来说，表达我们对 Linux 内核的爱可能都是一个好主意。\n\r\n\r\n而历史上，Linux 内核的一些版本有特别的名称，比如 Linux 5.17 就被命名为 “Superb Owl”（“超级碗”的一个文字游戏）。\n\r\n这一次，他的邮件得到了六位中国的 Linux 内核开发者的支持。但是，依旧没有得到 Linus 和其它国家开发者的回应。\n\r\n在大家的回应中，有人对 5.20 这个节日做了进一步解释，以及表达了一个并不浪漫的已婚男人对各种情人节的紧张，并表示这样的 520 挺好，不需要专门准备礼物。也有人表示，这是内核列表里面一次较大规模的“文化输出”，就像我们对美国人的“超级碗”无感一样，外国人对我们的 520可能也没什么感受。\n\r\n原本，我以为，这件事就此作罢了。不料 Linus Torvalds 在昨天发布 Linux 6.0-rc1 时，专门提到了这件事，他说，\n\r\n\r\n如果你愿意，你可以继续叫它 “Linux 5.20”。\n\r\n\r\n并且，Linus Torvalds 在这份公告里面再次重申了，主版本号变化并不代表有根本性的变化，他早就摒弃了“主版本号是有意义的”的说法了，而采用分层的版本号只是为了使版本号容易记忆而已。\n\r\n老王觉得，张同学这件事办的很好，诸位在内核邮件列表回复的同学也很给力。说到底，我们对 Linux 就是一种热爱，为什么不借着各种可能的机会来宣传它呢？虽然，Linux 越来越用在各种严肃的场合，但是 Linux，乃至开源，其本底一直是一种极客文化，“Just for Fun”，所以，为什么不呢？虽然，由于文化差异，没有得到太多的回应，但是我们的“文化输出”才能让世界对我们有更多的亲近。\n\r\n那么，你的看法呢？\n\r\n另外，你认为这样的版本号有趣吗？你会向你的爱人（如果不是计算机的话）讲这个故事吗？为了这个有爱的版本号，你是否会为 Linux 内核或更广泛的 Linux 做些什么吗（比如去修个 Bug，让你的痕迹留在 Linux 5.20 中）？\n\r\n（题图修改自：ninchanese.com）",

          "description": "如果你持续关注这几年的新播客，不难发现几乎每周都会有品牌开设播客的动态。去年，我们还在探讨品牌播客能否成为品牌传播矩阵的标配，但如今不断增长的品牌播客已经在用事实说明，该探讨的不再只是「为什么品牌要做播客？」，还应该包括「如何做好品牌播客？」通过这几年积累的案例，我们从播放数据、节目形态等方面进行提炼，给出这份品牌播客避坑指南。\n 不断扩张的品牌播客队伍   \n\n创立播客的国内品牌主要由两部分组成：一部分是新消费品牌，一部分是各行各业的头部企业。拥有较为充足的市场预算，对于传播媒介非常敏感，拥有持续内容创作的资源，最重要的是都有建立品牌形象的需求。\n\n在广告预算大幅缩减的环境下，许多大公司都在今年陆续进场，比如特斯拉、仲量联行、摩登天空等，都在近期开设了品牌播客。一些早期入局的品牌还在持续投入，Withinlink碚曦投资协作体出品的「贝望录」、GGV纪源资本的「创业内幕」都已规律更新超过三年。\n部分2022年开播的品牌播客\n经过对于近三年品牌播客的梳理，不难发现创立播客的国内品牌主要由两部分组成：一部分是新消费品牌，一部分是各行各业的头部企业。拥有较为充足的市场预算，对于传播媒介非常敏感，拥有持续内容创作的资源，最重要的是都有建立品牌形象的需求。\n品牌播客成为近期的内容趋势，有三个很重要的原因：\n播客市场认知不断提升，走出隐秘的角落。这点从微信指数上不难看出，去年7月31日指数为41万，今年同比翻了一倍，今年7月6日甚至猛增到了1222万。这背后可能是TME、Spotify在播客领域的持续布局，越来越多的名人大咖入场，但无论原因是什么，播客都在走进越来越多人的视野，成为不能忽视的媒介。\n品牌播客也有盈利空间，并非纯投入。品牌播客也可以为其他品牌打广告，乍一听并不是件可行的事，但实际已经在发生。因为想要让受众听完一期节目，首先不能一听就是广告宣传，这样很容易劝退，内容必须足…",

First, TikTok will begin rolling out its Election Center this week in order to provide authoritative voting information in the coming weeks and results from the Associated Press once they are reported. TikTok says it will link out to the Election Center through labels placed on midterm-related content, including videos posted by governments, candidates, and...\nContinue reading…",

          "description": "PH3OFF\n\n★ Introduction about Reading Buddy\n\n- ReadingBuddy simulates many scientific speed reading techniques such as Meta Guiding, and Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) to help you read faster with high comprehension\n\n- Accelerate your learning and life with our speed reading scientific methodologies designed for busy people who want to achieve more in less time.\n\n★ Main features\n\n⚡️ Reading pointer: Reading Buddy simulates the best speed reading technique called Meta Guiding.\n\nMeta guiding involves visually guiding your eye using some sort of pointer (finger, pen, or this Reading Buddy app) for the eye to move faster along the length of a passage of text.\n\n\n\nThe point is to decrease distraction and focus on the specific words to increase your reading speed. Try to keep moving your pointer slightly faster than your comfort zone to increase the reading speed.\n\n⚡️ Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP): In RSVP, a series of words appear rapidly in time at the same point in visual space. Indeed, the words may appear as fast as 10 items per second.\n\n\n\n\n⚡️ Reading Mode: distraction-free & ad-blocking reading viewer focusing on the main content.\n\n⚡️ Reading Analytics: Keep track of your reading goals including total words and words per minute daily, weekly, and monthly \n\nWe recommend moving your pointer with almost constant speed. Try to keep moving your pointer slightly faster than your comfort zone to increase the reading speed.  \n\nTry to read faster so that you catch up with your pointer. If you start losing comprehension, slow your pointer down. Otherwise, consider moving your pointer even faster.\n\n★ Privacy & Support\n\nWhat you read is your business.\n\nWe do not sell, rent, license, or otherwise monetize your data in any way.\n\nBy installing the extension, you agree to Reading Buddy's Privacy Policy.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

Fetching posts from Twitter and figuring out whether it's a memes or not - is difficult, and we knew this from the start. \"Isn't this a bit dull?\" I thought. \"We should add liking/retweeting and a points system\". And maybe a leaderboard to spice things up? And that's exactly what we did!\nWe made it so that liking, retweeting and posting also do the same on Twitter.\n\nWe still had a huge problem though - the automated feed pulled still wasn't perfect - the occasional NSFW content, spam, etc made it almost unusable.
