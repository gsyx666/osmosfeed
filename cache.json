At first, it is not easy to figure out how to split text into multiple pages because the area of the text, line heights and fonts are all dynamic. After a long development process, I've added multipage support to text to handwriting converter on 10015.io.\nNow, it automatically splits the text into multiple pages and you can download the image and PDF of each page separately or download all as a single PDF file.

          "description": "本指南旨在帮助你在 Firefox、Chrome、Chromium 和 Edge 等流行的网页浏览器中启用深色模式。\n\r\n\r\n我们都喜欢深色模式。与标准浅色模式相比，许多人更喜欢它。许多桌面应用原生提供深色模式，而一些应用则是通过桌面环境的底层模式适应深色模式。\n\r\n不可否认，我们都在网页浏览器上花费了很多时间。我们很少使用桌面应用（除非你从事专门的工作，例如视频编辑等）。因此，当你花费大量时间在浏览器中阅读和学习时，你始终可以选择深色模式。不过，对于网页浏览器，启用深色模式的方法略有不同。\n\r\n本指南为你提供了在 Firefox、Chromium、Chrome 和 Edge 浏览器中启用深色模式的简单步骤。\n\r\n在网页浏览器中启用深色模式\n\r\n在 Firefox 中启用深色模式\n\r\n打开 Firefox 并点击右上角的菜单。\n\r\n单击 “设置Settings > 扩展和主题Extension and Themes”。\n\r\n选择 “深色主题Dark Theme” 并点击 “启用enable”。你应该会看到深色模式已应用于 Firefox。\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Firefox 浏览器中启用深色模式\n\r\n\n\r\n深色模式下的 Firefox\n\r\n要将其还原，请按照相同的步骤并选择浅色主题。\n\r\nChromium 和 Chrome 中的深色模式\n\r\n默认情况下，Chromium 或 Chrome 不会预安装任何深色主题。因此，你需要前往 Chrome 应用商店并下载你想要的深色主题。对于本指南，我会推荐超过一百万用户使用的 “Morpheon Dark” 主题。\n\r\n从 Chromium 浏览器打开 Morpheon Dark 主题页面（以下链接）。\n\r\n\r\nChrome 应用商店中的 Morpheon Dark 主题\n\r\n\r\n点击 “添加到 ChromeAdd To Chrome” 按钮。它应该会在 Chrome 中启用。\n\r\n你可能想探索 Chrome 应用店中提供的其他深色或浅色主题。 访问此页面获取所有深色主题的集合。\n\r\n但是，你应该要记住的一件事是：此主题不会更改设置或上下文菜单，这是显而易见的。因为它只是改变了浏览器窗口，而这些菜单（有时）是操作系统本身的一部分。\n\r\n\n\r\nChromium 深色主题\n\r\n对 Chrome 浏览器也遵循相同的步骤。\n\r\nEdge 浏览器 – 深色模式\n\r\n但是，Edge 浏览器 默认带有更好的深色主题。它允许你从设置中使用 GTK+、浅色和深色模式。\n\r\n打开 Edge 浏览器，点击右上角的三个小点。\n\r\n转到 “外观Appearance” 并选择 “深色Dark”。这样应该就好了。\n\r\nEdge 的这种深色主题实现更好，因为它改变了上下文菜单和地址栏。\n\r\n\n\r\n深色主题的 Edge\n\r\n总结\n\r\n如果你是高级用户，你可能不需要本指南。你可以自己弄清楚。\n\r\n但我们为所有读者涵盖了所有基础到高级教程。许多新的 Linux 用户可能不知道如何在浏览器中启用深色模式。\n\r\n所以，就是说，我希望这对你和其他人有帮助。如果你遇到任何问题，请在下面的评论框中告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/dark-mode-browser/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux 中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "这个带有脚本的快速指南有助于清理旧的 Snap 版本并释放 Ubuntu 系统中的一些磁盘空间。\n\r\n\r\n我正在使用的 Ubuntu 测试系统中的磁盘空间不足。因此，我通过 GNOME 的磁盘使用分析器进行调查，以找出哪个包正在消耗宝贵的 SSD 空间。除了通常的缓存和主目录，令我惊讶的是，我发现 Snap 和 Flatpak 消耗了大量的存储空间。\n\r\n\n\r\n尽管如此，我始终坚持一个规则：除非必要，否则不要使用 Snap 或 Flatpak。这主要是因为它们的安装尺寸和其他问题。我更喜欢原生 deb 和 rpm 包。多年来，我在这个测试系统中安装和移除了一定数量的 Snap 包。\n\r\n但卸载后还有问题。Snap 在系统中保留了一些残留文件，一般用户不知道。\n\r\n所以我打开了 Snap 文件夹 /var/lib/snapd/snaps，发现 Snap 保留了以前安装/卸载的软件包的旧版本。\n\r\n例如，在下图中，你可以看到 GNOME 3.28、3.34 和 Wine 都被删除了。但它们还在那里。发生这种情况是因为 Snap 的设计，它在正确卸载后保留已卸载软件包的版本。\n\r\n\n\r\n或者，你可以在终端中使用：\n\r\nsnap list --all\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n对于保留的版本，默认值为 3。这意味着 Snap 会保留每个软件包的三个旧版本，包括活动版本。如果你对磁盘空间没有限制，这是可以的。\n\r\n但是对于服务器和其他情况，这很容易遇到成本问题，它会消耗你的磁盘空间。\n\r\n但是，你可以使用以下命令轻松修改计数。该值可以在 2 到 20 之间。\n\r\nsudo snap set system refresh.retain=2\r\n\n\r\n清理 Snap 版本\n\r\n在 SuperUser 的一篇文章中，Canonical 的前工程经理 Popey 提供了一个简单的脚本，它可以清理旧版本的 Snaps 并保留最新版本。\n\r\n这是我们将用来清理 Snap 的脚本。\n\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n#Removes old revisions of snaps\r\n#CLOSE ALL SNAPS BEFORE RUNNING THIS\r\nset -eu\r\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8 snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $3}' |\r\nwhile read snapname revision; do\r\n    snap remove \"$snapname\" --revision=\"$revision\"\r\ndone\r\n\n\r\n将上面的脚本以 .sh 扩展名保存在一个目录中（例如 clean_snap.sh），赋予它可执行权限并运行。\n\r\nchmod +x clean_snap.sh\r\n\n\r\n当我运行脚本后，它减少了很多磁盘空间。该脚本还将显示要删除的包的名称。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n结束语\n\r\n对于 Snap 的设计效率如何，人们总是争论不休。许多人说，它的设计是坏的，是臃肿的，是消耗系统资源的。这种说法的某些部分是真实的，我不会否认它。如果实施和加强得当，整个沙盒应用的概念是很好的。但我相信，与 Snap 相比，Flatpak 工作做得更好。\n\r\n也就是说，我希望这可以帮助你清理一些磁盘空间。尽管它只在 Ubuntu 中进行了测试，但它应该适用于所有支持 Snap 的 Linux 发行版。\n\r\n此外，请查看我们关于 如何清理 Ubuntu 的指南以及其他步骤。\n\r\n最后，如果你要清理 Flatpak 应用，请参阅 这篇指南。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/clean-up-snap/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "作为一名iPhone用户，快捷指令是系统中我觉得很有趣但实际上用得不是很多的应用。\n最初对快捷指令的理解仅限于将多个操作步骤简化成一个，最直观的应用就是在功能日益繁杂的APP中实现功能的一键直达，比如疫情期间的健康码。\n但深入探究一番后，我认为快捷指令的本质其实是打破各个APP沙盒的壁垒，实现不同应用程序的能力互通，提升个人的自动化水平。\n但事情情况并不尽如人意，虽然快捷指令编辑器提供了足够强大的编辑器，但三方应用对其支持并不好，大多数APP还是尽可能期望把用户圈在自己的生态中，没有开放足够的能力出来，这也是一款生态级应用的无奈。\n想象中的快捷指令\n现在应用商店的APP已经足够多，可以帮助人们解决足够多的问题，但有时候一款应用并不能完全解决某项任务，需要多个应用配合操作，如果用户可以随意调用应用中功能并组合成自己所需要完成特定任务的能力，那么用户体验和效率都将提升到新的高度。\n想象一种场景，当我在观看自己感兴趣的外语视频时，因为语言的障碍可能不能足够理解视频内容，我需要一些辅助支持：我希望翻译软件能够帮我把外语翻译成母语，甚至希望语音合成软件将翻译后的语言读出来。孤立地看这个场景中的每个需求，都有应用能很好得实现：视频网站能够提供我感兴趣的内容，翻译软件能将语言进行较高准确度的翻译，语音合成软件能够将文字朗读出来。但是当这三个需求点分布在三个不同的APP时，用户就难以较高效率完成这个场景的任务。实际上每个APP的能力都被封锁在了自己APP里面。\n\n上面说的这个场景我自己就有，但是因为没能使用现有工具很好使用，只得自己动手做了一个插件，可以朗读B站上面带有字幕的视频，因为微软的中文语音合成做得比较好，所以先放在Edge浏览器上了，目前还只支持带外挂字幕的视频，大家感兴趣也可以使用。\n\nB站视频字幕朗读（中文同传）插件地址-> Microsoft Edge Addons\n现实中的快捷指令\n虽然当前快捷指令还不够优秀，但对于日常效率的提升还是有一定帮助的，特别是对于实现与苹果自带应用的互通。\n举个使用的例子，每天早上我会用笔记软件记录一下昨日回顾、思考以及今日的计划，对于今日计划，我希望用待办应用去跟踪计划中事项的状态，但是手动把写过的东西在另一个APP里面再写一遍实在是太过愚蠢，于是我就写了快捷指令去实现。\n\n实际使用中，只要选择对应的文本并在共享表单中点击对应的操作就可以同步到系统自带的提醒事项中，在mac上还可以添加快捷键一键实现（应该还可以通过「自动化」省去手动操作这一步）。\n当前的快捷指令有三个亮点：\n\n在快捷指令的编辑上采用图形化拖拽操作，相对于写脚本，这种操作显得更加友好，并且也可以支持自定义脚本的加入，甚至让我一度觉得学编程的第一个应用是用快捷指令写得；\n在快捷指令的运行上打通了Siri、小组件以及共享操作，特别是后者，为与三方应用的结合提供了基础的平台；\n加入了自动化功能，可以根据一定的规则直接省去了用户主动调用快捷指令这一步。\n\n但要让更多的人在更多场景下使用快捷指令，还有着一些明显的不足：\n\n上手使用上有一些门槛，官方没有详细的教程，虽然提供了一些案例，但是大多数人应该没有耐心仔细去看快捷中心中那些精选的指令是如何实现的，这点Mac上快捷指令前辈「自动操作」可能给点其启示，其中「录制」功能可以通过「我做给你看」自动识别操作中的事件；\n快捷指令的分发做得还不够，既然不是每个人都能轻松使用快捷指令，那么获取现成的快捷指令则更加重要，但快捷指令中心中精选的指令本土化、个性化做得并不好，我觉得如果能根据用户所安装的APP来个性化分发常用的快捷指令会更友好；\n三方应用的能力开放明显不足，大多数的使用场景还是围绕在苹果自带应用提供的能力，这点极大限制了快捷指令的应用场景；\n使用Siri来激活快捷指令时对于指令的识别非常差，官方有说使用快捷指令的名称就可以通过Siri调用，但实际使用时不时语音识别不出来就是调用的指令不正确；\n\n有趣的是，在WWDC2022中，我们看到苹果开始推广App Intent框架，通过为应用开发者提供更多系统级的入口曝光来吸引他们将其应用所能满足的用户意图曝光给系统，从而使得系统可以通过学习用户行为实现跨应用的能力整合。\n结语\n很多人即使生活中充满重复的事情也不会去探索提高效率方式，因为对比眼前简单的操作，去探究增进效率操作的所花费的学习努力带来的成本更加高，只是把时间线拉得足够远，才能看见效率提升所带来收益。\n自动化所存在的意义是帮助人完成任务并节省时间，虽然我们每个人都已经拥有足够多的计算设备，但我们并没有充分发挥其拥有的算力，个人的自动化仍是一个尚待开发的领域。\n期待未来的快捷指令能为个人的自动化增添更多的可能性。",

Clauser) 和安东·泽林格 (Anton Zeilinger)，以表彰他们 「进行了纠缠光子的实验，确立了对贝尔不等式的不成立并开创了量子信息科学」。阿兰·阿斯佩克特、约翰·克劳瑟和安东·泽林格分别利用处于相互纠缠的量子态进行了突破性的实验。在这种情况下，两个粒子即使被分开也表现得如同一个整体。他们的成果为基于量子信息的新技术扫清了道路。\n—— 摘自诺贝尔物理学奖官方新闻稿\n\n说实话，在诺贝尔奖委员会正式宣布量子纠缠相关的成果获奖后，我立刻就意识到，互联网上很快就会充斥着各种针对量子纠缠以及量子世界的神秘性相关的科普。这些科普，无论是原创的还是东拼西凑的，无论是专家学者起草的还是各路内容流水线上生产的，都有一个共同的特征：它们往往都喜欢强化量子物理的神秘性和不可理解。\n我承认，历史上确实有这么一段时间，即使是 20 世纪初期那些鼎鼎大名的物理学家，都曾为量子相关的物理现象感到困惑。然而，经过一百多年的发展，量子物理的诸多核心概念早就被一代又一代的物理学家里里外外地玩了个遍，以至于许多被科普作家渲染得神乎其神的概念，现正躺在物理系本科生的必修课教材里。\n当然，量子力学有它反直觉的地方。但是，现实生活中反直觉的事情还少吗？反直觉并不意味着神秘或不可理解。它只是需要你屏蔽你的许多生活常识，用绝对的理性来思考问题。所以，这篇文章会和你读过的绝大部分科普不同，我不会把量子…",

          "description": "an easy-to-use platform that allows you to start a Bug Bounty program for your web and mobile applications in just a few clicks.\n\nWe’ve started BountyPage because we got frustrated with the way bug bounty programs are setup today - ❌ expensive and strenuous! Traditionally these programs were designed only for big corporations that can afford the crazy high costs. Our mission is driven by the belief that crowdsource security should be  ✅ open and accessible to anyone - no matter their size and type.\n\nOn average, a standard bug bounty program launch would cost you:\n- Tens of thousands of dollars in service fees alone 💵\n- 1-3 months of preparation time ⏰\n- Endless calls and emails back and forth with the accounts team ♾️ \n\nKeeping it super simple, BountyPage offers:\n✅ Beautiful and simple to use, hosted bug bounty form.\n✅ Intuitive inbox-like experience where you can triage issues with your team and establish communication with bug bounty hunters.\n✅ The ability to create invite-only programs.\n✅ Tools to understand the types of issues with reference links and descriptions.\n✅ A holistic view of all researchers in your program.\n✅ Custom subdomains (https://demo.bountypage.com).\n✅ Invite team members to triage vulnerabilities together.\n\nOh, and did I mention? It’s completely 🌟 FREE to get started. On average you can launch your first program in just a couple of minutes and share a custom link from your own website.🤩\n\nPlease let us know what you think! We very much appreciate any comments and suggestions. We’re constantly improving BountyPage and have big plans for feature releases in the next couple of months and your input can have a huge impact on the product development. 💬 💙\n\npdp\n\np.s.
