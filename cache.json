In this article, I will describe what problems I faced and how I tried to approach the problem from a mathematical and programming concept.\nSolidity does not have native support for fractional operations, rather it uses scaled version of numbers (i.e: uint256 and int256) to make operations for fractional calculation. for example, if you are to do an operation like this:\nlet x = 1/3;\n\nIn pure solidity the result needs to be scaled to adjust precision similar to this:\nuint256 x = (10**18)/3;\n\nOn top of that the natural exponential function makes it harder to calculate in pure solidity.\nf(x)=11+e…",

A UI Component Library is a collection of pre-made styles (like fonts, components, or colors) that can be quickly used to build websites. These UI components enable developers to create code that solves common problems—for example, creating buttons and components that work on all devices or adding menus and pre-built elements that are already designed for you so that you don't have to build them from scratch. In this article, we’ll explore the main benefits of using a UI component library or CSS framework when building your next project—and then we'll go over some excellent choices for free ones available on the market right now!\nThere are many UI component libr…",

          "description": "Regarding medusa, the project is made up of different building blocks.\nFor instance, you can run a server and separate admin panels or storefronts.\nLet's dive into that part, and I'll show you how we can set up the server and interact with it directly.\nThe first step is to install the medusa-cli. This will help us set up the project quickly.\nRun the following command in your terminal.\nnpm install @medusajs/medusa-cli -g\n\nWith this installed, we can create the server project. You can even go ahead and seed the database with dummy data.\nmedusa new medusa-server --seed\n\nThe project will be created in the medusa-server folder, and you can change this name in the command above to whatever you use.\nIt will take a while to install everything and seed the database. Once it's done, you can navigate to the folder.\ncd medusa-server\n\nAnd from there, we can start the server with the following command.\nmedusa develop\n\nThis should spool up the product, and you should eventually see it stating the server is available on port 9000.\nThe default medusa server will work based on an SQLite database, and we can super easily connect to the actual file with any database client.\nIn this example, I'm using TablePlus to connect to the SQLite file at the root of the project.\n\nOnce you're connected, you should see the seeded data available.\n\nAnother thing we can try out now is to test the actual API endpoints.\nFor instance, we can try and retrieve a list of all products.\nlocalhost:9000/store/products.\nFor example, when querying it with Insomnia, we can see all our products neatly listed.\n\nThank you for reading my blog.

          "description": "MySQL is one of the most used relational database management systems. We all know that it is fast and easy to use. In MySQL, storage engines are the components that handle the SQL operations. InnoDB is that widely used storage engine in MySQL. One of the reasons that make SQL operations fast is the index. If you create the index correctly, your query can be very fast. We can create an index on int, char type(one word) columns, but we can also create a FULLTEXT index on the text-based columns where we save multi-word strings. In this blog, I will explain how the FULLTEXT index works.\n\nIndex deletion\nDELETED[1] table whenever a record is deleted from an indexed table, and the indexed record remains in the full-text index. Before returning query results, information in the FTS_DELETED table is used to filter out deleted DOC_ID. The benefit of this design is that deletions are fast and inexpensive. The drawback is that the size of the index is not immediately reduced after deleting records. To remove full-text index entries for deleted records, run OPTIMIZE_TABLE on the indexed table with innodb_optimize_fulltext_only=ONto rebuild the full-text index.\n[1]: FTS_00000000000008c3_DELETED in above image contain the document IDs (DOC_ID) for documents that are deleted but whose data is not yet removed from the full-text index. FTS_00000000000008c3_DELETED_CACHE is in-memory version of FTS_00000000000008c3_DELETED. We first save it in cache and once cache is full, flush it to FTS_*_DELETED table.",

          "description": "本指南旨在帮助你了解如何在流行的浏览器，如 Firefox、谷歌 Chrome、Chromium 和微软 Edge 中启用深色模式。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n我们都喜欢深色模式。许多人喜欢它，而不是标准的浅色模式。虽然许多桌面应用提供了原生的深色模式，但一些应用通过桌面环境的基础模式适应深色模式。\n\r\n你不能否认，我们都在浏览器上花了好多时间。我们很少使用桌面应用（除非你是在工作，如视频编辑等）。因此，当你在浏览器上花很多时间阅读和学习时，你应该也可以选择深色模式。但是，对于各个浏览器，稍微有点不同。\n\r\n本指南为你提供简单的步骤，你可以按照这些步骤在 Mozilla Firefox、Chromium、Chrome 和 Edge 浏览器中启用深色模式。\n\r\n在浏览器中启用深色模式\n\r\n在 Firefox 中启用深色模式\n\r\n打开 Firefox ，点击右上角的设置菜单。\n\r\n点击 “设置Settings > 扩展和主题Extension and Themes”。\n\r\n选择“深色主题Dark Theme”并点击“启用enable”。然后你应该看到深色模式被应用到 Firefox。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n要恢复它，按照同样的步骤，选择浅色主题。\n\r\nChromium 和 Chrome 的深色模式\n\r\nChromium 或 Chrome 默认不预装任何深色主题。因此，你需要去 Chrome 商店，下载任何你想要的深色主题。在本指南中，我将推荐 “Morpheon Dark” 主题，它有超过一百万用户在使用它。\n\r\n从 Chromium 浏览器中打开 Morpheon Dark 主题页面（从以下链接）。\n\r\n\r\nChrome 网络商店中的 Morpheon Dark 主题\n\r\n\r\n点击“添加到 ChromeAdd To Chrome” 按钮。它应该会在 Chrome 中启用。\n\r\n你可能想探索 Chrome 网络商店中的其他黑白或深色主题。请访问此页面，查看所有的深色主题集合 。\n\r\n然而，你应该记住一件事：这个主题不会改变设置或上下文菜单。这很明显。因为它只是改变了浏览器窗口，而那些菜单是操作系统本身的一部分（有时）。\n\r\n\n\r\n对 Google Chrome 也要按照同样的步骤进行。\n\r\nEdge 浏览器的深色模式\n\r\n然而，微软 Edge 浏览器 默认带有更好的深色主题。它允许你从设置中使用 GTK+、浅色和深色模式。\n\r\n打开 Edge 浏览器\n\r\n点击右上角的三个小圆点。\n\r\n进入“外观Appearance”，选择“深色Dark”。这就完成了。\n\r\n这个 Edge 的深色主题实现得更好，因为它改变了上下文菜单和地址栏。\n\r\n\n\r\n结束语\n\r\n如果你是一个高级用户，你可能不需要这个指南。你可以搞清楚。\n\r\n但我们为所有的读者涵盖了所有从基础到高级的教程。许多新的 Linux 用户可能也不知道如何在浏览器中启用深色模式。\n\r\n因此，话虽如此，我希望这能帮助你和其他人。如果你遇到任何麻烦，请在下面的评论栏里告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/dark-mode-browser/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

At the end of the work day, I packed up my laptop and walked out the door of our office building. Several months later, we were all still working from home. None of us had returned to our office-based workstations. In July 2020, using safety precautions, we were granted access to our workstation solely to retrieve personal items. My desk was left exactly as I left it that afternoon in March. Expiring snacks stashed in my secret drawer. Picture frames collecting dust. Comic strips pinned up.\n…",

It’s powerful and flexible as a result of its per-project environment configurations, which can be extended, version controlled, and shared. In short, DDEV aims to allow development teams to use containers in their workflow without the complexities of bespoke configuration.\nDDEV replaces more traditional AMP stack solutions (WAMP, MAMP, XAMPP, and so on) with a flexible, modern, container-based solution.

The router creates a local network, and you connect your devices to it, including your computer, mobile, TV, game console, and anything else that needs to connect to the Internet or to each other. It's deceptively easy to think of this setup as there being two \"sides\" of your router: On one side there's the Internet, and on the other, your devices. That's an awful colloquial, though, because in reality there's an entire worldwide network of computers on one side of your router, and your digital life on the othe…",

Examples of Job implementations typically provide trivial scripts written directly in the manifest. In any reasonably-complex application, however, determining how to handle more-than-trivial scripts can be challenging.\nIn the past, I've tackled this problem by including my scripts in an application image.

          "description": "Greetings Hunters!\n\nWe are proud to finally be able to share FlexPDF with you 🎉 🥳! We developed this tool to help publishers convert PDF files to responsive HTML with just a few clicks.\n\nFlexPDF's main target audience will be PDF publishers (magazines, catalogs, brochures, books, guides, etc.) that need a solution to move away from static PDF files to responsive HTML as more than 60% of readers today consume content from their mobile devices.\n\nThe Challenge:\nExisting free tools will convert PDF to HTML, but the results are usually pretty bad for a couple of very important reasons:\n\n1. the HTML code generated is cluttered and not optimized for search engines\n2. there is typically no good ways to navigate content in chapters or articles\n3. content is still absolute and not responsive, which means it breaks on mobile devices\n4. it's hard to edit or include interactive things like audio, video and animations\n5. the results are typically littered with formatting errors, missing words and broken layouts\n\nFlexPDF is Different!\nOur focus is on generating responsive HTML results that look and read great on any device, size and orientation that delivers an excellent mobile experience.\n\n1. the HTML code generated is clean and has the correct syntax \n2. content is separated into chapters/articles and navigation is built into the output including an automatically generated table of contents.\n3. content is responsive which means it looks and reads great on any device, size and orientation\n4. the output can currently be shared in three main ways. You can download the HTML, use an embed code or share a link. All 100% branded to clients.\n5. results are almost 100% error-free \n\nFlexPDF is Version 1.0\nWe are launching here on ProductHunt in hopes of getting some feedback to improve the tool even more. We hope you will find a few minutes to try it out and let us know what you think in the comments.\n\nThanks for all your support. This is a fantastic community!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
