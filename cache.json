          "description": "A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.\n\nThe function adder returns another function when invoked, the lexical scope includes the sum variable which is accessible by the returned function. Note that in Go, a closure is always an anonymous function.\nfunc adder() func(int) int {\n   sum := 0\n  // this is a closure, it has access to sum variable\n  // each closure has its own sum variable\n    return func(x int) int {\n        sum += x\n        return sum\n    }\n}\n\n\nevery time adder is invoked, it creates a new function with closure.\n  addFn := adder()\n  fmt.Println(addFn(1)) // initial sum value of 0 is added to 1  \n  fmt.Println(addFn(2)) // returns 3, sum variable is maintained by addFn closure\n  // calling adder like below will not work as intended as the closure from first line is not being used by the second line, instead, creating a new one\n  fmt.Println(adder()(1)) // returns 1\n  fmt.Println(adder()(100)) // returns 100\n\nAnother example of closure below where the closure is assigned to a variable first\nfunc namer() func() string {\n    name := \"my name\"\n  // name variable still exists in fn even after namer is finished\n    fn := func() string {\n        return name\n    }\n  return fn\n}\n\nWith the fundamental understanding of closure, let's explore defer in the next post - one of the unique things in Go compared to other popular languages",

          "description": "本指南介绍了如何在没有互联网连接的情况下离线更新 Ubuntu 的步骤。\n\r\n\r\n在很多情况下，你可能需要在没有互联网连接的情况下更新你的 Ubuntu 系统。你可能在外地不方便上网，也可能你需要更新一堆未联网的 Ubuntu，不管是哪种情况，保持你的系统更新最新的软件包总是需要的。\n\r\n当然，始终建议通过联网来更新系统。\n\r\n但有时，出于安全考虑，这是不行的。连接到互联网可能需要给你的系统进行额外的加固，以保护它们免受黑客和恶意软件的攻击。\n\r\n以下的方法使用 apt-offline 来解决这些问题，并概述了在没有互联网的情况下离线更新 Ubuntu 的步骤。\n\r\n准备环节\n\r\n\r\n一台能连接到网络的 Ubuntu（你朋友的、咖啡馆、实验室系统）\n\r\n存储了软件包的 U 盘\n\r\n两个系统都安装了 apt-offline：一个系统离线，另一个系统联网\n\r\n\r\n安装 apt-offline\n\r\n在两个系统下安装 apt-offline。你可以使用以下命令安装：\n\r\nsudo apt install apt-offline\r\n\n\r\n如果你想在离线的目标系统安装 apt-offline，你可以提前下载到 U 盘里，然后复制到目标系统，再使用下面的命令安装。\n\r\nUbuntu 22.04 LTS 和其他版本的下载链接如下所示。你可以选择一个镜像并下载 deb 文件。\n\r\n\r\n下载 .deb 文件 – apt-offline\n\r\n\r\nsudo dpkg -i name_of_package.deb\r\n\n\r\n如何更新 Ubuntu\n\r\n在离线的目标系统上打开终端，使用以下命令创建一个 .sig 签名文件：\n\r\nsudo apt-offline set ~/offline-data.sig\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n在这个刚创建的签名文件中，包含下载所需的软件包的路径和详细信息。\n\r\n\n\r\n把签名文件复制到 U 盘中，再插到联网的 Ubuntu 系统上。\n\r\n在联网的 Ubuntu 上创建一个目录（参见下面）来存放这些文件。\n\r\n打开一个终端，运行以下命令来下载所需的软件包。记得根据你的系统，更改下载目录和 .sig 签名文件的路径。\n\r\napt-offline get -d ~/offline-data-dir offline-data.sig\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n你可以看到文件相应下载，然后复制整个下载目录到 U 盘，再插到离线的 Ubuntu 系统。\n\r\n运行以下命令将下载的软件包安装到离线系统，记得根据你的系统更改目录路径。\n\r\nsudo apt-offline install offline-data-dir/\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n如果一切顺利，你将获得一个更新完的 Ubuntu。\n\r\n重复以上步骤，就可以保持你的离线 Ubuntu 为最新版本。\n\r\n希望以上教程能帮到你更新离线的 Ubuntu 系统，如果你遇到任何问题，请在下面的评论框中告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/how-to-update-or-upgrade-ubuntu-offline-without-internet/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：littlebirdnest 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "英伟达采用形式验证来验证软件安全性\n\r\n英伟达软件安全副总裁说，“面向测试的软件验证对安全来说根本不起作用，你可以对提供给用户的功能的质量有一个衡量标准，但对于安全问题，就没有什么作用，……很难知道你是否已经完成了。”幸运的是，有可能用数学方法证明你的代码的行为与它的规范精确一致。这个过程被称为“形式验证”。英伟达采用软件形式验证行业解决方案 SPARK 来证明软件的安全性。在几年前进行过概念验证后，现在许多英伟达产品在使用 SPARK 组件发布。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：AdaCore\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：形式验证是个好方法，但是不是那么容易掌握和推行。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nJavaScript、Java、Python、Kotlin 和 Rust 开发者增长惊人\n\r\n根据 SlashData 去年夏天从 163 个国家的 26000 多名开发者调查统计而成的第 23 期《开发者国家报告》，JavaScript 仍然是最大的编程语言社区，全球估计有 1960 万开发者每天都在使用 JavaScript；在过去的两年里，Java 社区的规模已经从 830 万增加到 1650 万，而同期开发者只增加了 50%；Python 在过去两年中增加了约 800 万新的开发人员；Kotlin 和 Rust 社区的规模在过去两年里都翻了一番。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：ZDNet\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：开发人员越来越倾向于使用主流开发工具，所以流行的越发流行，但是这样就会扼杀一些创新。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n密码学家建议考虑非晶格的后量子密码算法\n\r\n目前许多密码学系统的安全性是基于大数的因数分解的，但因数分解的一个怪癖使其容易受到量子计算机的攻击。因此人们对上世纪 90 年代提出的“晶格密码学”寄予厚望，美国 NIST 选择的四个后量子密码学标准有三个采用晶格密码学。RSA 算法名称中的 S，Adi Shamir 对此表示担忧，“从某种意义上说，我们是把所有鸡蛋放在同一个篮子里”。今年夏天早些时候，一个有前途的后量子密码学方案不是用量子计算机，而是用一台普通的笔记本电脑破解的。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Slashdot\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：确实如此，只有一种抗量子的密码理论，很难说会不会被发现潜在的弱点。",

          "description": "以下是如何在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版中提高笔记本和桌面的音量的方法。\n\r\n\r\n你有没有觉得你的 Ubuntu 笔记本的音量太小，尽管你把音量调到了 100%？我相信你有过。主要原因是：很明显，笔记本电脑的扬声器输出强度比大型扬声器要低。\n\r\n此外，Ubuntu 和其他发行版将默认的最大音量设置为 100%，也就是 0dB（分贝）。0dB 是最大音量的参考值。做个比较，如果你把音量设置为 -10dB，这意味着你的音量比最大的 0dB 安静。\n\r\nVLC 和一些媒体播放器允许你将音量提高到 200%。在最新的 Ubuntu 中使用一些设置，你可以将音量进一步提高。\n\r\n\r\n注意：在你尝试和使用以下方法之前，请记住，每个扬声器都有其制造商设定的硬件限制。偶尔一次，播放超过 100% 的音频是可以的。但是，连续放大到更高的分贝可能会使输出的音频失真，并且从长远来看可能会损坏你的扬声器。因此，在使用时要小心谨慎，并有所限制。\n\r\n\r\n在 Ubuntu 和其他发行版中提高扬声器音量\n\r\n对于最新的 Ubuntu 22.04 及以上版本（GNOME）\n\r\n从应用菜单中打开“设置Settings”，进入“声音Sound”标签。\n\r\n启用 “过度放大Over Amplification” 开关。在你启用的那一刻，你应该看到音量条被扩大了。\n\r\n\n\r\n现在你可以享受音量提升来听音乐了。\n\r\nFedora、Arch Linux 和其他发行版\n\r\n如果你使用带有 GNOME 的 Fedora 工作站，你将看不到上述选项，因为这是 Ubuntu 特有的设置。见下面。\n\r\n\n\r\n因此，对于任何其他 Linux 发行版（Arch、Fedora、RedHat 等）或桌面（KDE、Xfce、LXQt 等），打开终端并安装 PulseAudio 音量控制器。\n\r\nFedora、RedHat Linux、OpenSUSE 等基于 RPM 的发行版：\n\r\nsudo dnf install pavucontrol\r\n\n\r\n对于 Arch Linux、Manjaro：\n\r\nsudo pacman -S pavucontrol\r\n\n\r\n基于 Ubuntu 的非 GNOME 发行版：\n\r\nsudo apt install pavucontrol\r\n\n\r\n如何使用\n\r\n安装后，从应用菜单中打开 pavucontrol，它应该有个 &ldquoulseAudio Volume Control” 菜单项。\n\r\n\n\r\n总结\n\r\n记住，上述方法可以提高整个系统的扬声器音量。这意味着系统的声音和警报也会受到影响。所以，要记住这一点。正如我前面提到的，如果连续使用，提升扬声器音量超过 100% 可能会导致扬声器变形或损坏。\n\r\n我希望这个教程能帮助你提高系统音量。如果你遇到问题，请在评论栏里告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/boost-speaker-volume-ubuntu/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "作为一名iPhone用户，快捷指令是系统中我觉得很有趣但实际上用得不是很多的应用。\n最初对快捷指令的理解仅限于将多个操作步骤简化成一个，最直观的应用就是在功能日益繁杂的APP中实现功能的一键直达，比如疫情期间的健康码。\n但深入探究一番后，我认为快捷指令的本质其实是打破各个APP沙盒的壁垒，实现不同应用程序的能力互通，提升个人的自动化水平。\n但事情情况并不尽如人意，虽然快捷指令编辑器提供了足够强大的编辑器，但三方应用对其支持并不好，大多数APP还是尽可能期望把用户圈在自己的生态中，没有开放足够的能力出来，这也是一款生态级应用的无奈。\n想象中的快捷指令\n现在应用商店的APP已经足够多，可以帮助人们解决足够多的问题，但有时候一款应用并不能完全解决某项任务，需要多个应用配合操作，如果用户可以随意调用应用中功能并组合成自己所需要完成特定任务的能力，那么用户体验和效率都将提升到新的高度。\n想象一种场景，当我在观看自己感兴趣的外语视频时，因为语言的障碍可能不能足够理解视频内容，我需要一些辅助支持：我希望翻译软件能够帮我把外语翻译成母语，甚至希望语音合成软件将翻译后的语言读出来。孤立地看这个场景中的每个需求，都有应用能很好得实现：视频网站能够提供我感兴趣的内容，翻译软件能将语言进行较高准确度的翻译，语音合成软件能够将文字朗读出来。但是当这三个需求点分布在三个不同的APP时，用户就难以较高效率完成这个场景的任务。实际上每个APP的能力都被封锁在了自己APP里面。\n\n上面说的这个场景我自己就有，但是因为没能使用现有工具很好使用，只得自己动手做了一个插件，可以朗读B站上面带有字幕的视频，因为微软的中文语音合成做得比较好，所以先放在Edge浏览器上了，目前还只支持带外挂字幕的视频，大家感兴趣也可以使用。\n\nB站视频字幕朗读（中文同传）插件地址-> Microsoft Edge Addons\n现实中的快捷指令\n虽然当前快捷指令还不够优秀，但对于日常效率的提升还是有一定帮助的，特别是对于实现与苹果自带应用的互通。\n举个使用的例子，每天早上我会用笔记软件记录一下昨日回顾、思考以及今日的计划，对于今日计划，我希望用待办应用去跟踪计划中事项的状态，但是手动把写过的东西在另一个APP里面再写一遍实在是太过愚蠢，于是我就写了快捷指令去实现。\n\n实际使用中，只要选择对应的文本并在共享表单中点击对应的操作就可以同步到系统自带的提醒事项中，在mac上还可以添加快捷键一键实现（应该还可以通过「自动化」省去手动操作这一步）。\n当前的快捷指令有三个亮点：\n\n在快捷指令的编辑上采用图形化拖拽操作，相对于写脚本，这种操作显得更加友好，并且也可以支持自定义脚本的加入，甚至让我一度觉得学编程的第一个应用是用快捷指令写得；\n在快捷指令的运行上打通了Siri、小组件以及共享操作，特别是后者，为与三方应用的结合提供了基础的平台；\n加入了自动化功能，可以根据一定的规则直接省去了用户主动调用快捷指令这一步。\n\n但要让更多的人在更多场景下使用快捷指令，还有着一些明显的不足：\n\n上手使用上有一些门槛，官方没有详细的教程，虽然提供了一些案例，但是大多数人应该没有耐心仔细去看快捷中心中那些精选的指令是如何实现的，这点Mac上快捷指令前辈「自动操作」可能给点其启示，其中「录制」功能可以通过「我做给你看」自动识别操作中的事件；\n快捷指令的分发做得还不够，既然不是每个人都能轻松使用快捷指令，那么获取现成的快捷指令则更加重要，但快捷指令中心中精选的指令本土化、个性化做得并不好，我觉得如果能根据用户所安装的APP来个性化分发常用的快捷指令会更友好；\n三方应用的能力开放明显不足，大多数的使用场景还是围绕在苹果自带应用提供的能力，这点极大限制了快捷指令的应用场景；\n使用Siri来激活快捷指令时对于指令的识别非常差，官方有说使用快捷指令的名称就可以通过Siri调用，但实际使用时不时语音识别不出来就是调用的指令不正确；\n\n有趣的是，在WWDC2022中，我们看到苹果开始推广App Intent框架，通过为应用开发者提供更多系统级的入口曝光来吸引他们将其应用所能满足的用户意图曝光给系统，从而使得系统可以通过学习用户行为实现跨应用的能力整合。\n结语\n很多人即使生活中充满重复的事情也不会去探索提高效率方式，因为对比眼前简单的操作，去探究增进效率操作的所花费的学习努力带来的成本更加高，只是把时间线拉得足够远，才能看见效率提升所带来收益。\n自动化所存在的意义是帮助人完成任务并节省时间，虽然我们每个人都已经拥有足够多的计算设备，但我们并没有充分发挥其拥有的算力，个人的自动化仍是一个尚待开发的领域。\n期待未来的快捷指令能为个人的自动化增添更多的可能性。",

The company’s launching what it calls .Swoosh, a Web3 platform that will eventually let users buy, sell, and trade virtual shoes and apparel.\nNike didn’t offer too many details about what exactly to expect but suggests that you will one day be able to use its assets as wearable items in digital games and “other immersive experiences.” While signups for the platform open on November 18th, don’t expect to actually buy anything: .Swoosh’s first digital collection doesn’t come out until next January.

That’s a bug, not a feature. It shouldn't be this hard to schedule a meeting from your phone in 2022.\n\nVimcal iOS makes scheduling on-the-go a breeze by giving you these superpowers on your phone:\n\n* Drag and copy your availabilities \n* Convert time zones with 2 taps\n* Look up your teammates’ calendars\n* Use meeting templates to avoid filling in every detail\n* And more!\n\nIt was our team's top priority this year to craft the absolute best mobile app experience. What you see today is the result of 9 months iterating on feedback from our early TestFlight users.\n\nThe best part? The mobile app is free!\n\nI’ll be here all day so feel free to drop a comment or book a 15-min Slot with me here to say hi =)\n\nLFG!! 🚀🚀\nJohn\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
