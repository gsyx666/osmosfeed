This release doesn't provide new features, but it has some improvements that are worth to be noticed. \nWe met a problem deploying the storage engine on a NAS device because it didn't work with the GitHub registry.  Now, all releases are pushed to DockerHub additionally.\nPreferable way to use the engine is:\ndocker run -p 8383:8383 -v ${PWD}/data:/data reductstorage/engine:latest\n\nPreviously, a client had to ask an access token by using an API token and the GET /auth/refresh endpoint:\n# Take a temporal access token by using the API token\ncurl -X POST --header \"Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}\" -a https://play.reduct-storage.dev/auth/refresh\n\n# Create a bucket\ncurl -d \"{\\\"quota_type\\\":\\\"FIFO\\\", \\\"quota_size\\\":10000}\" \\\n  -X POST \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}\"   \\\n  -a https://play.reduct-storage.dev/b/my_data\n\nThe issue with this approach is described here.\nNow, GET /auth/refresh is deprecated, and the preferable approach is:\n# Take a temporal access token by using the API token\nexport API_TOKEN=reduct\n\n# Create a bucket\ncurl -d \"{\\\"quota_type\\\":\\\"FIFO\\\", \\\"quota_size\\\":10000}\" \\\n  -X POST \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}\"   \\\n  -a https://play.reduct-storage.dev/b/my_data",

Let us take a look at some of the major changes and updates.\nIn Linux Mint 21 Blueman replaces Blueberry.\nBlueberry depended on gnome-bluetooth, which was developed exclusively for GNOME. In contrast, Blueman relies on the standard Bluez stack which works everywhere and can even be used or queried from the command line. \nBlueman's UI was polished for mint and looks much better than before. Blueman also received support for many symbolic icons which gives it a much more refined look and integrates it with other m…",

          "description": "任何考虑在开源领域发展的人都具有无限的可能性。下面是我的故事。\n\r\n\r\n当人们问我最喜欢开源的什么时，我的回答很简单：那就是 开放性 。在开源中，社区开发者和贡献者所做的工作是在公共领域的，所有人都能看到并从中受益。我对这一理念爱不释手。\n\r\n有多少人可以对他们的劳动成果这样说？有多少人，也许在 50 年后，可以回过头来说：“看看我那天写的代码，有几百/几千/几万人从中受益。”我觉得这比从事那些对世界上大多数人来说都是隐秘的软件工作更令人无比兴奋。\n\r\n我很幸运，我的工作使我置身于一个开源和企业交叉的有趣领域中。如今，我是 OpenNMS 集团 的首席技术官，这家公司负责维护 OpenNMS 项目。OpenNMS 是一个领先的开源网络监控和管理平台。\n\r\n虽然我现在的角色让我牢牢扎根于开源领域，但我是以用户和贡献者身份开始的。\n\r\n2007 年，我得到了我的第一份真正的技术工作，在加拿大蒙特利尔的电信服务提供商 Datavalet 技术公司从事网络分析。在五年的时间内，我成长为解决方案架构师，任务是帮助公司选择网络管理解决方案。我们选择了 OpenNMS，正是通过这次经历，我认识到了开源的真正力量。\n\r\n在平台上线时，我们发现了一些缺失的功能，这些功能将有助于优化我们的体验。一位来自 OpenNMS 集团的代表在现场帮助我们进行部署，并建议我参加社区即将举行的 DevJam，与核心开发人员一起建立我们需要的功能。\n\r\n在 DevJam 期间，我很快就融入了团队和社区。我们卷起袖子，开始编码，以创建 Datavalet 所需的增强功能。在几天之内，这个附加的功能就准备好了。这是一次令人惊叹的变革性经历，让我真正看到了开源的力量。\n\r\n一年后，我离职了，在康科迪亚大学全日制学习数学。正是在那里，我再次有机会与 OpenNMS 团队合作，这一次是在该年的谷歌代码之夏的一个项目上。在这个年度计划中，参与者的目标是成功完成开源软件开发项目。\n\r\n代码之夏对我来说是一次改变职业生涯的经历。OpenNMS 的两位负责人参加了我们的项目演示，一年后，OpenNMS 团队邀请我作为一名全栈开发人员加入。\n\r\n我努力工作，迅速晋升，并在 2015 年被任命为首席技术官。我认为这是一项个人成就，也再次验证了开源世界的特别之处。如果你喜欢与社区合作，热爱你所做的工作，你的贡献很快就会得到认可。\n\r\n开源精神也影响了我从个人贡献者到首席技术官的发展，我现在领导着一个由 50 多人组成的产品开发团队。社区本质上是平等的，我与社区贡献者一起工作的经验教会了我如何在环境中领导，而不是控制。\n\r\n我经历了一段奇妙的开源旅程，从用户到贡献者，再到一家开源公司的高管。开源方法超越了技术，因为专有开发环境中经常存在的障碍的进入和增长可以通过协作、透明和社区来克服。因此，对于任何考虑在开源领域工作的人来说，可能性是无限的。我就是证明。\n\r\n我们生活在一个人们正在深刻审视自己的生活及其对世界的影响的时代。在开源公司工作特别有意义，因为我可以直接与用户社区互动并影响他们。终端用户和开发人员之间的经典屏障被打破了，我可以确切地看到我的工作如何改变人们的日常生活，或者激励人们为项目做出贡献。通过对一个项目的共同热爱来建立社区，建立持续一生的联系。\n\r\n我知道这对我来说都是真实的，这也是为什么我对我的工作如此热情。我是一个彻头彻尾的开源极客，并以此为荣。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/8/my-open-source-career-story\n\r\n作者：Jesse White 选题：lkxed 译者：aftermath0703 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

Network-level observability is provided by several orchestrators, either natively or by using plugins and operators.\nRecently, eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) emerged as a popular option to…",

Most of these misconceptions focus on security, flexibility, and central management. In this article, I will debunk some of these myths.\nMany misconceptions likely arise because users know only the basic functionality of sudo. The sudoers file, by default, has only two rules: The root user, and members of the administrative wheel group, can do practically anything using sudo. There are barely any limits, and optional features are not enabled at all. Even this setup is better than sharing the root password, as you can usually follow who did what on your systems using the logs. However, learnin…",

It guides you through a simple workflow to brainstorm, define, progress, review and accomplish your goals. It’s set up as an iterative system to get better at getting better. \n\nWhat’s included?\n\n- Resources and guides on goal-setting based on work of various authors such as Stephen Covey, Bill Burnett & Dave Evans, Naval Ravikant and Chris Bailey\n- A clean dashboard for your goals which you can orient your existing goal management systems around\n- Checklists and templates that guide you through the processes of setting and checking in with your goals.\n\nWhy did I make it?\n\nIt was the scratch-your-own-itch-factor. Well, more than just my own itch. Whenever I ask my team and friends what they struggle with the most it's unanimously goal setting. Wat goals should I set? How do I define good goals? How do I stay on track? As COO and Product Manager at our 40-employee business I landed on OKRs as the goal-setting framework of preference. So, After having tried and tested the system for the past years it felt like the right thing to launch as my first indie-project. \n\nI’ve been eager to start with independent projects for a while now. As ferocious Product Hunt follower it’s incredibly exciting to be on the launching-end for the first time. I’m grateful for my colleagues and online-friends who’ve encouraged me to take this step. And, a massive shout out to the Product Hunt community for nurturing such a great launch pad.\n\nIn celebration of the launch all Product Hunters get 50% off with code: ph50 \n\n\nI’m excited to see your feedback and happy to answer any questions you might have!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

My goal was to create simple tools that are private, local, customizable, and easy to use, without all the annoying junk like massive ads, popups, invasive tracking, or forced social media integration.\n\n\n👾 CSS @Keyframe Animation Editor\nA tool that gives you a timeline (like movie editing software) to easily create and preview CSS animations. \n\n❐  Box-Shadow generator\nSimply move some sliders to adjust your shadow, add multiple layers, then get the CSS.\n\n🎨 Colors\nCreate & convert colors, create color palettes, view color contrast and colorblindness, create gradients, and share your palettes.\n\n⌨️ Character codes\nSearch for and easily copy special character CSS and HTML values.\n\n👋 What makes it stand out:\n• It's free - all features. \n• It's private & local - Keyframes only uses Local Storage, and there are no 3rd party trackers or ad networks. It's also open source, so you can verify.\n• The UI is customizable - the theme, font, borders, and behaviors like confirmation dialogues and tooltips can be disabled.\n• Created from scratch - no frontend frameworks or 3rd-party libraries let me get everything just how I wanted it.\n\n\nSo if you're a developer or designer who works with CSS a lot, I hope these tools can be useful and save you some time. I'll be adding more tools over the coming weeks - so keep an eye out!\n\nI'd love to hear any questions, suggestions, ideas for other tools, criticism, or anything else you have to say!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
