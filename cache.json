          "description": "After my last article about Typescript, I've decided to move forward and start building a website.\nWhen it comes to building your first website, it's important to take some time to figure out what your purpose is. Why do you want to build a website? What are you hoping to accomplish? Once you have a clear understanding of your purpose, you can start to research and plan accordingly. \nWhen I first decided that I wanted to build a website, I had no idea where to start. Finally I decided to start with React, because I had heard good things about it, but I didn't know much about website building. So, I started doing some research. I read articles, watched videos, and talked to people who knew more about React than I did. \nThen I had the opportunity to learn about Next JS, a React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications. I was really impressed with how easy it was to get started and how powerful the framework is.\nFinally I took some time to learn about Vue JS, and I have to say that I was impressed with what I found. Vue JS is a JavaScript framework that is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. It offers a great way to build web applications using a component-based approach.\nThere are a number of great frameworks available for building websites, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. React is a great choice for beginners because it is easy to learn and there is a lot of documentation available. Next JS is a great choice for those looking to build server-side rendered or static web applications. And finally, Vue JS is a great choice for those looking to build interactive applications.\nDo you have any suggestions for an easy to work with, interesting and engaging framework that I can use to build my website? I would like to learn as much as I can from the process while working on it 🥰",

          "description": "随着在设备上使用各种程序的用户的需求变得越来越复杂，程序本身也需要跟上用户的现实需求和未来期望。\n\r\n我发现我每天需要的东西是一个在网页浏览器保持登录多个账号的简单方法。我 可以 根据需要对我的每个账号进行登录和注销操作，但在短时间内切换多个账号时，这变得非常乏味。\n\r\n最初，我使用谷歌浏览器，它拥有管理多个帐户的能力。这很有效，但管理起来略显繁琐，而且明明只需 一个 谷歌账号就能搞定的事却要创建一个新的谷歌账号来完成，这显得有点儿笨拙。\n\r\n这是我转而使用 Firefox 多账户容器Multi-Account Containers 功能的原因。它不仅比我在谷歌 Chrome 浏览器上的设置灵活得多，而且我还使用了由我的浏览器开发者自己创建的工具，从而在整体上获得了更流畅和更简单的体验。\n\r\n\n\r\nFirefox 中的多帐户容器是什么？\n\r\n如果你想将数字生活的各个部分彼此分开，多账户容器也非常有效。通过使用容器，你在一个容器中的浏览活动不会与其他容器共享。这种隔离意味着你可以在不同容器中登录同一网站上的两个不同帐户。你的登录会话、网站偏好和跟踪数据将被限制在你使用某个网站的容器中。\n\r\n它还有什么其他优势？想象一下，你在亚马逊或其他电子商务网站上购物。你浏览了一些商品，但没有购买任何东西。现在，如果你浏览网络，你会看到与你浏览的产品相关的广告。尽管有广告拦截器，一些网站仍会显示广告。使用容器，你可以将你的购物网站与其他网站分开。（LCTT 校注：甚至根据你的浏览历史，你再次访问同一网站时看到的价格可能会被“宰熟”——反复浏览代表了你的购买倾向。）\n\r\n再给大家分享一个例子。Firefox 默认提供一个 Facebook 容器。默认情况下，此容器包括 Facebook、Messenger 和 Instagram 网站。这意味着当你打开这三个网站中的任何一个时，它们都只会在“…",

          "description": "Facebook 创始人年轻时也曾宣誓捍卫用户隐私\n\r\n2003 年 Slashdot 曾经 报道，哈佛大学新生扎克伯格和加州理工新生丹吉洛开发了一个系统，可以分析用户的音乐播放列表并学习人们的收听模式。这个制作播放列表的软件是他们的高中毕业项目。这篇帖子引起了微软和其他公司的注意，有公司给出了一份接近一百万美元的报价，但他们拒绝了。有趣的是，在该帖子的一个评论中，后来成为 Facebook 创始人的扎克伯格曾发誓要保护用户隐私，“除了你之外，你的音乐收听数据都不会提供给其他任何人。我们希望利用大量的数据来帮助分析，但你的个人数据将永远不会被其他人看到。”而后来成为 Quora 联合创始人和 CEO 的丹吉洛，也补充说，“我不会向人们发送垃圾邮件。我保证。”\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Slashdot\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：曾经的年轻人都怀着淳朴的理想，然而成为巨龙之后，都喜欢珠宝。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n研究人员发布可以本地运行的 Copilot 替代品\n\r\nGitHub Copilot 是最近几个在 AI 帮助下生成编程代码建议的工具之一，但在许可证方面和该软件向微软公司发送遥测数据方面存在一些争议。美国纽约大学的一位研究人员开源了一个 Copilot 的替代品 FauxPilot，它可以在本地运行，而不会将数据发送回微软。FauxPilot 不使用 Codex，它依靠的是 Salesforce 的 CodeGen 模型。但该模型也是在 GitHub 所有的公共代码上训练的，因此许可证问题并没有得到解决。当然，你可以使用这个可以本地运行的 AI 模型专门针对某类许可证进行学习，或许针对你自己希望重复使用的代码进行学习。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：如果计算量可以承受，我想这个开源的 AI 工具或许在某些开发组织里面发挥作用。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nOpenSUSE 考虑移除 Reiserfs 文件系统\n\r\n20 多年前，Reiserfs 首次引入 SUSE 时，它是当时领先的文件系统，首次为 Linux 引入了日志保护。但在 Reiserfs 作者因谋杀罪而入狱后，该文件系统的开发就停滞了。ReiserFS 一度是 SUSE 的默认文件系统。Reiserfs 现在缺乏用户期望拥有的很多功能，SUSE 的开发者制定了在 SUSE 滚动版中立即移除 Reiserfs 的计划，稳定版也将在几个版本后移除支持。而 Linux 内核从 5.18 开始正在逐渐弃用 ReiserFS，并计划在 2025 年完全删除相关代码。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：本来颇有希望的一个文件系统，却中途崩沮。从某种意义上说，现在的很多开源项目还相当依赖其灵魂人物，一旦遇到“被卡车撞了”这样的意外，如果没有及时引起社区关注和接手，很可能就随同夭折了。",

          "description": "如果你使用的是 Ubuntu 22.04，你可能已收到过此通知。\n\r\n\n\r\n它会通知你 Firefox 更新正在等待中，并要求你关闭应用以避免中断。\n\r\n因此，就像一个听话的 Ubuntu 用户一样，你在保存或完成工作后关闭了 Firefox 浏览器。\n\r\n你认为 Firefox 已在后台更新，重启浏览器将运行较新版本。\n\r\n只是，并非如此。\n\r\n即使在你重启浏览器甚至计算机后，它仍可能显示相同的 “pending update of Firefox” 通知。\n\r\n令人沮丧么？我可以告诉你发生了什么。\n\r\n让我解释一下为什么会发生这种情况，以及你可以做些什么来“修复”它。\n\r\n修复 “pending update of Firefox snap” 问题\n\r\n早些时候，Firefox 曾经在后台更新，然后要求你重启浏览器。在你重启浏览器之前 不能 打开任何网站。\n\r\n\n\r\n在将 Firefox 浏览器切换为默认 Snap 包格式 后，Ubuntu 团队对更新流程进行了一些改动。\n\r\n此通知是“改进的用户体验”的一部分。现在，Firefox 不再阻止你浏览。你可以在方便时重新启动浏览器以进行更新。\n\r\n但是为什么即使在你重新启动浏览器或系统后它仍然显示这个通知？\n\r\n因为这是一条糟糕的通知消息，无法为你提供完整的信息。\n\r\nFirefox 更新还没有开始\n\r\n当你看到 “pending Firefox update” 时，你错误地认为应用已在后台更新，重启会将其升级到较新的版本。\n\r\n而对于现在这种情况，Ubuntu 中的 Snap 包每天会自动刷新（更新）一次或几次。为了避免在重新启动安装更新之前 Firefox 不允许你浏览任何内容而导致工作中断，Ubuntu 甚至不会在后台更新 Firefox Snap 包。\n\r\n相反，当 Snap 包刷新时，它会显示通知并希望你立即关闭浏览器，以便可以使用其他 Snap 包进行更新。\n\r\n但像你我这样的用户不能这样做，对吧？看到通知，立即关闭浏览器？并不是很方便。\n\r\n而当你有时间关闭浏览器时，Snap 刷新却不会马上更新浏览器。\n\r\n你可以看到更新的 Snap 版本的 Firefox 可用，但只要 Firefox 正在运行，它就不会自动安装。\n\r\n\n\r\n更新 Firefox Snap\n\r\n这是你摆脱每天不断出现的更新通知所需要做的事情。\n\r\n\r\n关闭 Firefox 浏览器\n\r\n手动运行 Snap 刷新（更新已安装的 Snap 包）\n\r\n\r\n确保你在 Firefox 浏览器中的工作已保存。现在，使用鼠标关闭所有 Firefox 浏览器或在终端中运行以下命令：\n\r\nsudo killall firefox\r\n\n\r\n现在 Firefox 不再运行，更新 Snap 软件包：\n\r\nsudo snap refresh\r\n\n\r\n你会看到它开始下载更新的 Firefox 包。\n\r\n\n\r\n更新完成后，你将看到 Firefox 已升级到更新版本的摘要信息。\n\r\n\n\r\n总结\n\r\n安装非 Snap 版本的 Firefox 也可能是个解决方案，但不是每个人都可以走这条路。\n\r\nFirefox 和 Snap 的开发人员必须齐心协力改进这个模棱两可的更新过程。他们应该提供更好的机制，不仅显示待处理更新的通知，还提供启动更新的选项。\n\r\n这是我们最近在 Ubuntu 上看到的许多奇怪的事情之一。这必须改变才能使 Ubuntu （再次）成为一个对初学者友好的发行版。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/pending-update-firefox-ubuntu/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "这个带有脚本的快速指南有助于清理旧的 Snap 软件包，并释放 Ubuntu 系统中的一些磁盘空间。\n\r\n\r\n我的 Ubuntu 测试系统中出现磁盘空间不足。因此，我通过 GNOME 的磁盘使用分析器进行调查，以找出哪个软件包正在消耗宝贵的 SSD 空间。除了通常的缓存和主目录，令我惊讶的是，我发现 Snap 和 Flatpak 消耗了大量的存储空间。\n\r\n\n\r\n我始终坚持一个规则：除非必要，否则不要使用 Snap 或 Flatpak。这主要是因为它们的安装大小和一些其他问题。我更喜欢原生 deb 和 rpm 包。多年来，我在这个测试系统中安装和移除了一些 Snap 包。\n\r\n问题出现在卸载后。Snap 在系统中保留了一些残留文件，而一般用户不知道。\n\r\n所以我打开了 Snap 文件夹 /var/lib/snapd/snaps，发现 Snap 会保留以前安装/卸载的软件包的旧版本。\n\r\n例如，在下图中，你可以看到 GNOME 3.28、3.34 和 Wine 这些都被删除了。但它们还在那里。这是因为 Snap 设计上在正确卸载后保留已卸载软件包的版本。\n\r\n\n\r\n或者，你可以在终端中使用：\n\r\nsnap list --all\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n对于保留的版本数量，默认值为 3。这意味着 Snap 会保留每个软件包的 3 个旧版本，包括当前安装版本。如果你对磁盘空间没有限制，这是可以的。\n\r\n但是对于服务器和其他场景，这很容易遇到成本问题，消耗你的磁盘空间。\n\r\n不过，你可以使用以下命令轻松修改计数。该值可以在 2 到 20 之间。\n\r\nsudo snap set system refresh.retain=2\r\n\n\r\n清理 Snap 版本\n\r\n在 SuperUser 的一篇文章中，Canonical 的前工程经理 Popey 提供了一个简单的脚本 可以清理旧的 Snap 版本并保留最新版本。\n\r\n这是我们将用来清理 Snap 的脚本。\n\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n #Removes old revisions of snaps\r\n #CLOSE ALL SNAPS BEFORE RUNNING THIS\r\n set -eu\r\n LANG=en_US.UTF-8 snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $3}' |\r\n     while read snapname revision; do\r\n         snap remove \"$snapname\" --revision=\"$revision\"\r\n     done\r\n\n\r\n将上述脚本以 .sh 格式保存在目录中（例如 clean_snap.sh），赋予其可执行权限并运行。\n\r\nchmod +x clean_snap.sh\r\n\n\r\n当我运行脚本时，它减少了很多磁盘空间。该脚本还将显示要删除的包的名称。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n结束语\n\r\n关于 Snap 的设计效率如何，人们总是争论不休。许多人说，它的设计是糟糕的，是臃肿的，且消耗系统资源。该论点的某些部分是正确的，我不会否认。如果正确实施和增强，沙盒应用的整个概念就很棒。我相信，与 Snap 相比，Flatpak 做得更好。\n\r\n也就是说，我希望这可以帮助你清理一些磁盘空间。尽管它只在 Ubuntu 中进行了测试，但它应该适用于所有支持 Snap 的 Linux 发行版。\n\r\n此外，请查看我们关于 如何清理 Ubuntu 的指南以及其他步骤。\n\r\n最后，如果你正在寻找清理 Flatpak 应用，请参阅 这个指南。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/clean-up-snap/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：校对者ID\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "中国内核开发者向 Linus 建议继续保留 5.20 版本号\n\r\n前两天，在 Linux 内核 5.19 的发布公告中，Linus Torvalds 称，由于比较大的数会让他混淆，按照惯例，他准备将 5.20 版本“20 进位”到 6.0。今天，一位中国的 Linux 内核开发者 Zhang Boyang，在内核邮件列表中向 Linus 表示，“5.20” 在中文代表“我爱你”。因此，“Linux 5.20” 在中文中可以被理解为 “我爱 Linux”。因此，他建议 Linus 继续使用 5.20 版本号，以鼓励对 Linux 的热爱。之前，Linux 在发布 3.11 版时，曾将该版本专门命名为 “Linux For Workgroups”，以纪念微软的操作系统里程碑 Windows for Workgroups 3.11。不过，目前 Linus 和其它人尚未对此进行回应。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：内核邮件列表\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我觉得这个建议不错，不知道 Linus 会怎么想？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nGitLab 禁止员工使用 Windows\n\r\nGitLab 的文件显示，它允许员工使用 Linux 和 macOS，而禁止使用 Windows。理由是：Windows 是份额最高的桌面系统，因此也是间谍软件、病毒和勒索软件的最主要目标。Windows 家庭版的安全性难以保障，因此不符合该公司的安全准则。苹果的电脑是首选，如果熟悉 Linux 也可选择戴尔公司的 Linux 笔记本电脑。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：GitLab\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：有道理的规定，作为一个技术公司，这样要求不过分。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n开发者大幅精简 Rust for Linux v9 补丁\n\r\n本周早些时候，开发者发布了 Rust for Linux v8 补丁，这些补丁带来了多达 43.6 万行新代码，而今天发布的 Rust for Linux v9 大幅瘦身，删除了许多额外的功能和集成，只有 12.5 万行的新代码。开发者称，“这是一个精简过的 v8。它有足够的支持来编译一个最小的 Rust 内核模块，目的是先获得‘核心’支持，然后开始向上游逐个扩展其他部分。”Linus Torvalds 一直希望尽快完成该补丁的合并。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看来，在下一个 Linux 内核中我们有望见到 Rust 的正式支持了。",

          "description": "有几个可供桌面 Linux 用户使用的 电子书阅读器。\n\r\n几乎所有发行版都带有可以打开 PDF 文件的文档阅读器。它还可能支持其他文件格式，例如 epub 或 Mobi，但不一定。\n\r\n这就是为什么需要像 Foliate 和 Calibre 这样的专门应用来阅读和管理各种格式的电子书的原因。\n\r\n最近，我遇到了另一个开源软件，它为电子书阅读器提供了几个令人兴奋的功能。\n\r\nKoodo：它有你能想到的一切\n\r\nKoodo 是一款多合一的开源电子书阅读器，具有帮助你更好地管理和阅读电子书的功能。它是一个跨平台应用，你可以在 Linux、Windows 和 macOS 上下载。你甚至可以 在浏览器中使用它。\n\r\n它的用户界面看起来很现代，可能是因为它是一个 Electron 应用。你必须导入书籍并将它们添加到 Koodo。它不按文件夹导入书籍。不过，你可以选择多个文件进行导入。书太多了？可以将一些添加到你的收藏夹以便快速访问。\n\r\n\n\r\n我使用了 AppImage 格式的软件包，但由于未知原因，它没有显示文件的缩略图。\n\r\n\n\r\n它支持流行的电子书文件格式，如 PDF、Mobi 和 Epub。但不止这些，它还支持 CBR、CBZ 和 CBT 等漫画书格式，它还支持更多。它还可以阅读 FictionBooks（.fb2）、Markdown 和富文本格式（RTF）以及微软 Office Word 文档（.docx）。\n\r\n除了支持很多文件格式外，它还提供了多种功能来改善你的阅读体验。\n\r\n你可以高亮显示文本并使用文本注释对其进行注释。你还可以在当前文档或谷歌上搜索选定的文本。\n\r\n\n\r\n你可以从主应用窗口的侧边栏中访问高亮显示的文本和注释。\n\r\n也有文本到语音和翻译选定文本的选项。但是，这两个功能在我的测试中都不起作用。我使用的是 Koodo 的 AppImage 版本。\n\r\nKoodo 支持各种布局。你可以以单列、双列或连续滚动布局阅读文档。对于 ePub 和 Mobi 格式，它会自动以双列布局打开。对于 PDF，默认选择单列布局。\n\r\n你可以根据自己的喜好自定义 UI。更改字体、大小、段落间距、文本颜色、背景颜色、行间距、亮度等。\n\r\n\n\r\nKoodo 支持夜间阅读模式以及五个不同的主题。你可以根据自己的喜好在主题之间切换。\n\r\n你还可以使用 Dropbox 或其他支持 Webdav 协议的 云服务 跨设备同步你的书籍和阅读数据（如高亮、笔记等）。\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Linux 上获取 Koodo\n\r\n如果你想体验一下 Koodo，你可以试试它的在线版本。你可以在浏览器中使用 Koodo。你的数据本地存储在浏览器中，如果你清理浏览器缓存，你会丢失数据（高亮、笔记等，但不会丢失计算机上存储的书籍）。\n\r\n\r\n在线尝试 Koodo\n\r\n\r\n如果你喜欢它的功能，可以选择在您的计算机上安装 Koodo。\n\r\nLinux 用户有多种选择。你有 Debian 和基于 Ubuntu 的发行版的 deb 文件、Red Hat 和 Fedora 的 RPM，以及面向所有发行版的 Snap、AppImage 和可执行文件。\n\r\n你可以从项目主页获取你选择的安装程序。\n\r\n\r\n下载 Koodo\n\r\n\r\n总结\n\r\nKoodo 并不完美。它有大量功能，但并非所有功能都能完美运行，正如我在测试中发现的那样。\n\r\n尽管如此，它仍然是一个很好的应用，有可能在用户中流行起来。只有少数几个应用包含如此多的功能。\n\r\n感谢 Koodo 开发人员为桌面用户创建了一个有前途的开源应用。\n\r\n你可以 访问该项目的仓库 来查看源代码、报告 bug 或者通过给项目加星来向开发者表达喜爱。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/koodo-ebook-reader/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "经济独立后，我很快发现自己之前的消费方式需要调整。\n我之前买东西几乎没有计划，大部分是偶发性的，也有很多冲动购买。其次，我对价格有些不敏感，总觉得平台上是这个价格那就这样吧；对很多产品的质量也没有概念，常常不知道该从何判断。比如买水果，我都是让商家随机装一些就过秤拿走。我也很少考虑买东西之后的处置行为，比如多久该把东西淘汰，日用品一般要屯多久等等。\n我逐渐觉得，我应该花些心思调整自己的生活和消费——我需要一个能让我在「重复购买」「快速更迭」的商品上省钱，可以为生活长远算计的在线平台。1688 就这样进入了我的视野。\n1688 建立的初衷是为批发商或者商户找到合适的生产商，由于平台允许商户购买样品，所以个人消费者也可以在 1688 上进行购买。在 1688 平台进行了大半年采买后，我想和大家分享一下我的购物体验和购物感受，也欢迎各位朋友分享你的「批发」心得。\n本文分享的所有产品和卖家均是来自于自己及朋友购买经历，不含有任何广告或者宣传。\n在 1688 购物的原因\n在 1688 购物主要就是为了两方面：规划预算省钱，适量囤货日用。1688 正好在这两点都是强项。\n各大社交平台都有博主提过，同款的产品，其他购物平台基本价格一致，而 1688 上可以便宜一半甚至是更多。因为 1688 上的卖方是生产商，少了很多分销渠道的成本和加价。这也是为什么 1688 会有很多东西便宜到让人惊讶的原因，毕竟「要批发，上 1688」。\n举个例子，我在南方经常要用的除湿袋，在 1688 上的价格是 0.7 元一包，购买超过 250 包，会便宜到 0.68 元。而在当地超市买到的同款至少一包 2 元，有些网购平台甚至要 5 元一包。\n这是我楼下超市卖的同款，非常好用，五块钱一包。\n偶尔一包可能价格差距不大，但这种除湿袋我每年都会用掉很多，累计起来就不在少数了，带上全寝室批发则开销更大。类似的还有袜子、…",

          "description": "「记录」这件事就是非常有威力，它会把注意力之外的小细节收集起来，给予一种确实发生但又意料之外的生活视角。比如如果不是记账，我不知道原来每个月会支出那么多零零碎碎的「拿铁因子」；如果不是 HiWater，我也不会知道原来自己摄入那么多含糖饮料。\n其实我很早之前就购买过 WaterMinder 这款 App Store Editors's Choice 应用，只是彼时的我并不明白「多喝水」三个字对身体的意义，同时也觉得记录喝水这件事就像是记账——没有外部约束、「记录多少全凭诚实美德」的记录只在于自我娱乐。所以往往三天后意兴阑珊删除了事。\nHiWater 则是好友 @特伦 推荐的，把玩了下觉得还不错，但当时并不想为这个需求掏钱；不久前确诊痛风后，离开诊室满心灰暗的我有了「每天喝水 3L+」的刚需，这才发现这款应用的每一个付费点都值得我掏钱。\n作为一款国产应用，HiWater 的饮品目录预设种类都比较契合日常，并且在目录处还醒目地标注了每 100 毫升所带有的千卡热量。向下翻阅到高热量饮品时甚至有一种黑名单的既视感。\n\n如此设计的部分原因是，HiWater 采用了「饮水金字塔」模型，它将所有饮品归在六个等级内，并依此建议每日摄入的比例。此模型虽有哈佛大学公共卫生学院专家的背书，总体指导思想依然是鼓励大家多喝白水，减少摄入高糖、甚至是含糖饮料。\n关联阅读：如何合理控制糖分摄入\n\n对喝水提醒应用来说，我们一般会面临预设饮品难以覆盖真实世界情况的问题。\n所以在 HiWater 中我们也可以新增或编辑饮品类目到「饮水金字塔」模型中，把某个模糊的品类变成精确的单品。比如说 HiWater 预设了椰子水这个饮品，但我日常喝得比较多的是山姆椰子水，那我就直接编辑成山姆椰子水的营养成分，并重新归类到低卡饮料分类中去；再比如我喝的柠檬水是浓缩液和水 1:10 冲兑而来，因此我也通过计算将预设的「柠檬水」编辑成「自制柠檬水」，并由浓缩液计算出对应的热量。\n当然，手动编辑多了我们自然就会想：这些外包装上带有营养成分表的商品饮料，如何快捷记录到应用内？\nHiWater 的答案是「直接用相机扫」，请直接看这个动图：\n\n我猜测可能 Apple 在系统中给了 OCR 相关的 API，开发者就取来做这个功能了。这是我最喜欢的功能，实际使用起来识别比动图中要更迅速，识别率高且稳定。偶尔可能会有一些识别错误，比如把 ≥ 识别成 2，但我也能原谅。\n如此一来，在机场购买的农夫山泉力量帝柠檬水、屯了两箱的兰芳园低糖冻柠茶，都可以统统扫入我的饮品目录。记录时也可以根据自己的实际情况调整，比如冻柠茶虽是低糖，我还是会将它兑冰水或柠檬水喝，因此我的喝水记录里经常会出现 50 毫升的冻柠茶、紧接着出现 200 毫升的水或柠檬水。\n\n之前做手冲咖啡用的秤，现在大多被我用于称水喝，但后续我发现只要记住水倒在杯子上的花纹位置，不用秤也能大致知道这杯水的量。以名创优品的 580 毫升容积的可乐杯为例，杯内两道凹痕，分别可以粗略看作是 200/500 毫升的刻度。在公司喝水，可以考虑在工位启用大杯子装水，之前因为杯子小+次数少，上班时喝水太少。一周下来，确实每日喝水 3.3L 以上。\n\n其余的基础功能，诸如弹出提醒用户喝水、身体水分的简单预估、根据用户情况估算需要摄入的水量等，我就不一一展开了，WaterMinder 也有，我认为这些是一款「喝水类」App 都应该做的免费功能。其实我原先也是想通过快捷指令自己做一个提醒和记录每日喝水的应用，这不难，我甚至已经做好了 社死版快捷指令 定时运行，但体验过 HiWater 的一些交互后，我最后决定不折腾自己了。\n应用内还有不少花心思的交互和设计\nHiWater 多样的桌面小组件，还支出快捷录入饮品，打破了我对 iOS 小组件「能看不能用」的固有认知（我原先在 iOS 上并不使用任何 Widget，这一下就微上瘾了，顺带一口气添加了其余应用的小组件 xD）。\n精美的 Widget，支持快捷录入\nHiWater 采用免费下载+内购解锁的付费机制，如果你看完文章对它感兴趣，安装来把玩把玩也可以。如果想要为它付费的话，建议先确认自己有强烈的督促自己喝水的需求，然后订阅一个月试试——我直接买断是因为意识到「多喝水」这样的生活我可能要持续好几个月，甚至好几年，本身并不是很理性的消费习惯。\n如果一个应用能够帮助我长期维持某个健康习惯，我愿意给出「十刀买断，天大划算」的评价；如果没有，我也会用「三分钟热度三分钟收获」来安慰自己。\n> 下载 少数派 2.0 客户端、关注 少数派公众号，解锁全新阅读体验 📰\n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀",

          "description": "自《PasteNow for iOS 正式发布》后，已有三个月没有介绍 PasteNow 了。这三个月，PasteNow 也没有停止进化的脚步，分别迭代了 2.1、2.2 和 2.3 这几个版本，其中 2.3 于今天刚刚发布。本篇即是汇总一下过去三个月 PasteNow 的发展与变化。\n支持 Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴\n正如标题所说，2.3 版本带来了「Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴」的功能。这是 PasteNow 迄今为止非常重要的一个改进，不仅带来更加一致的体验，同时也大大提升效率。解决这个问题其实有点周折，我先简单地补充一下背景：\n\nWord 和 Pages，因为其固有机制的原因（也许是 Bug），它不支持剪贴板的多项目粘贴。也就说是，往剪贴板里写入多项内容，再在 Word 里操作粘贴，你会发现只有第一个内容粘贴了进去，但是如果同样在备忘录（或其他 App）里操作粘贴，是会出现多个内容的。\n\nPasteNow 的用户最早在去年7月就给我汇报了这个问题，当时我发现是 Word 和 Pages 的固有机制导致的问题后，决定暂时观察一段时间，因为也许 Word 在更新后会「修复」这个问题。\n但是等了很久，这个行为始终没有发生变化，看来确实是固有机制的限制了。正好最近又有用户汇报了相关问题，我换了一下思路，看看能不能从 PasteNow 这边做点什么的方式来解决这个问题。于是还真让我找到了一个办法。\n假如你是 Word、Pages 等的重度用户，经常需要粘贴内容至 Word、Pages 里，特别是一次性粘贴多项内容，现在通过 PasteNow 可以更好的做到这些了。请看视频！\n \n更加全面和完善的快捷键体验\n作为一个效率工具，能100%通过快捷键来达成各种操作一直是 PasteNow 重点优化的方向。在过去几个版本中，PasteNow 加强了以下两方面的快捷键体验：\n\n支持将 F1～F12 录制成快捷键了，这意味着可以用更加轻松的「单键」来达成 PasteNow 的各项操作；\n支持通过按下“@、%、$”等特殊符号也进入快速搜索模式；\n「添加标题」和「编辑文本」操作，也有了专属快捷键，分别是：Command + T 和 Command + E。\n\n相信通过以上快捷键的改进，使用 PasteNow 的过程将更加流畅。\niOS 版本的变化\n三个月前的主要事件是 iOS 版本的发布，过去三个月，iOS 版本发展的怎么样呢？这里不得不承认一个事实，这个版本并没有达到各种预期，无论是我作为开发者的预期，还是用户对它的预期。\n首先是我作为开发者的预期，目前 iOS 版本的用户非常少，日活跃用户最多时仅为 macOS 版本的 1/15。相当于 15 个 macOS 版本用户才对应 1 个 iOS 版本。这其实也是在我的预期中，但没想到会差这么多。\n另一方面是作为用户的预期，很多用户对这款 iOS 产品寄予了厚望，以为也可以像 macOS 版本一样做到后台记录剪贴板内容、实时同步剪贴板数据。但事实是这个从 iOS 的机制上就做不到，并且在即将发布的 iOS 16 里，对剪贴板的操作将会进一步变得更难。\n以上当然不是用户预期的问题，而是我在打造这款产品时没有准确的传达信息导致的，后续在 iOS 版本中，我将增加一个 FAQ 模块，让用户可以非常直观地了解到这个工具能做什么，不能做什么等等。\n当然，我依然会尽力去完善 iOS 版本的体验，使其与 macOS 的基本功能靠近，比如在 2.3 版本当中，图片类的数据，现在也可以通过长按保存至相册了。这个是会比较实用且基础的一个操作。\n小结\nPasteNow 从 1.0 发布到今天，不过一年又三个多月，它依然是一款年轻的产品，我会继续按照既定节奏去稳步迭代，不断完善它的体验与其他 App 的互操作能力。\n希望它继续给大家带来愉悦的效率之旅～\n附：少数派下载与购买链接。\n \n \n演示：PasteNow 2.3 多项目粘贴至 Word",

While this was a step in the right direction, it still allows your entire list of contacts to see whether or not you’re online. WhatsApp’s upcoming update is supposed to fix that, though, as it will let you choose which contacts can see your status. So if you don’t want someone to know that you’re ignoring their message, toggle on the setting for that user, and they’ll (hopefully) never know the difference.\nWhatsApp is also launching another handy feature that will let you silently leave groups....\nContinue reading…",

They combine to provide a breakthrough engineering workflow. \n\nAll this gives you control over your disparate data tools and empowers you to build, test, deploy, run, and iterate on your data pipelines. Teams that have adopted Dagster report having a blast building their data pipelines, and you don’t usually hear that when it comes to working on orchestration.\n\nDagster Cloud includes some amazing productivity tools for data teams - here are a few standouts:\n\nBranch Deployments:\nA game-changing feature for data engineers, it allows you to move quickly and confidently from PR to merge. Branch Deployments are lightweight staging environments created with every PR. No more testing on production, no more testing locally without matching your cloud environment.\n\nHybrid or Serverless options: \nWith Serverless, Dagster hosts the entire orchestration engine. Spin-up  is completely effortless. Just write a Python file, and we do the rest: no Dockerfiles, no Kubernetes, no provisioning.  With Hybrid, you bring your compute platform and let Dagster host the control plane, which does not see your code or data. This helps maximize flexibility and security while offloading the operational burden.\n\n Dagster’s unified control plane: The ‘single plane of glass’ data teams love to use\ndagster.io to try Dagster. And join our growing  community.\n\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

We took a step back and looked at the direction authentication technology is going. Behind the scenes at W3C, the most influential standards body of the Internet, a vision for a permanent alternative to the password has been developed.

          "description": "How should these models be tested before they’re even deployed? 🤔 \n\nLike every startup - we started with experimentation. We named the first prototype the “Preemptive report”.\nDespite the REALLY compelling name 😅 the first people who saw it responded with:\n “How come this doesn’t exist yet??” \nAt the same time, we realized that testing for problems with your data, model, and ML process, is relevant also much earlier in the research phase. The smiles on the faces of Data Scientists when running our package on a new batch of data, told us that this understanding is correct...\n\nAs we are a company of tech-savvy engineers, it was clear that the way to go for a dev-tool used during research, was to build it open source, and we started working on the package towards its planned release. After iterations with hundreds of Data Scientists from the amazing community (to which we owe many thanks 🙏) and receiving great feedback and suggestions (for usability, additional ideas for checks, requests for integrations with tools, and many more), we’re happy to announce the deepchecks testing package here on Product Hunt 🚀\n\nShow your support by giving us a star ⭐️ on github: https://www.github.com/deepchecks/deepchecks\n\nOur commitment is to keep this project open source, and to continue building a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, for “Continuous Validation” of ML pipelines, from research to production – for Tabular, CV, and NLP Data & Models.\n\nMore links to jump right in:\n- Get Started\n- Join Our Slack Community for more updates and info about ML validation and testing\n-  Open an Issue on Github for feature requests and feedback\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
