To me, it's wasted typing, wasted effort for no benefit. It doesn't make the code any better or easier to read, and it might save a few milliseconds here and there. I'm all about that. I'm all about choosing the path of least resistance, what I called \"the lowest effort option\" in my tweet.\nEw. Lowest effort option?

Click on  Build a database.\n\nNow click on the shared cluster and click Create. You will be then navigated to the cluster configuration page. Go with default options and click on Create Cluster.\n\nFor authenticating the connection , enter a user name for eg, admin and autogenerate the password. Keep both username and password safe, as we will be needing it while establishing a connection from any server side framework with your mongodb atlas. Click on Create User.\n\nFor Where would you like to connect from , choose the local environment , click on Add my current IP address and click on Add Entry. Finally , click on Finish and close. \nCongratulations  🎉 🥳 🥂 . You have finally created your shared cluster. \nYou can connect your MongoDB cluster to any of the following \n\n\nMongoDB shell.\nServer side application using native MongoDB drivers.\nMongoDB Compass.\nMongoDB host in VSCode.\nYou can create a collection and database and play around with it. \nThanks for reading everyone. In the next blog , we will see how to create an API with FastApi ( Python web framework ) and MongoDB.",

REST API is an application program interface that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE data.\nLaravel provides an easy way to create API. If you have authentication in your mobile app then you can easily do it using the passport. \nLaravel passport provides a way to create auth tokens for validating users. If your application absolutely needs to support OAuth2, then you should use Laravel Passport.\nSo, let's see how to create REST API with authentication using a passport in laravel 9 application, laravel 9 rest API with passport authentication.\nStep 1: Install Laravel 9 for REST API with Passport Authentication\n\nStep 2: Install Passport Using Composer\n\nStep 3: Passport Configuration\n\nStep 4: Add Table and Model\n\nStep 5: Create API Routes\n\nStep 6: Create Controller\n\nStep 7: Create Eloquent API Resources",

          "description": "If you're running a WordPress site, then you're going to need a database. And when it comes to databases, you have two main options: MariaDB or MySQL. But which one is best for WordPress?\nIn this post, we're going to pit MariaDB against MySQL and see which one comes out on top. We'll cover everything from the pros and cons of each database to how to choose the right one for your WordPress site.\nBy the end of this post, you should have a good understanding of both MariaDB and MySQL and how they work with WordPress.\nWordPress users can choose between MariaDB and MySQL. Both databases are open source, meaning that anyone can access and modify the code. However, there are some key differences between the two databases.\nFor example, MariaDB offers more storage engines than MySQL. This means that it can support a wider range of data types and SQL queries.\nAdditionally, MariaDB has better performance than MySQL. This is because it was designed with higher-traffic environments in mind, such as web applications and ecommerce sites.\nIf you are looking for a database that is both powerful and performance-friendly, then MariaDB should be your choice. \nHowever, if you are only concerned about price, MySQL may be more affordable. Either way, it's important to choose the right database for your specific needs.\nWhen choosing a database for WordPress, there are many factors to consider, including compatibility with the web hosting that the site is using, performance, security, price, and ease of use.\nOne of the most popular databases for WordPress compatibility is MariaDB. It is also one of the most affordable databases available. But, MySQL may be more suitable for some sites due to its higher performance.\nUltimately, the best database for WordPress is the one that meets the specific needs of the site.",

          "description": "这是有关如何在 Oracle VirtualBox 中启用 USB 的指南。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n当你在虚拟机环境中工作时，USB 通常插入主机系统。但是从客体系统访问 USB 内容有点困难。\n\r\n在 VirtualBox 中，你需要安装一些扩展并启用一些设置才能访问 USB。方法如下。\n\r\n本文假设你已经安装了 VirtualBox，并且还在其中安装了一些 Linux 发行版或操作系统。\n\r\n如果没有，请查看 这篇文章。\n\r\n\r\n请注意，Oracle VM VirtualBox 扩展包采用 Oracle 的个人使用和评估许可证（PUEL）。该许可证与 VirtualBox 不同，后者采用的是 GPL。如果你将下面的步骤用于商业目的，请确保你仔细阅读 本页面。\n\r\n\r\n在 VirtualBox 7.0 中启用 USB\n\r\n安装 VirtualBox 扩展包\n\r\n打开 VirtualBox 下载页面并从 此链接 下载适用于所有支持平台的 VirtualBox 扩展包。\n\r\n\n\r\n然后单击 “文件File > 工具Tools > 扩展包管理器Extension Pack Manager”。\n\r\n单击工具栏中的 “安装Install” 按钮并选择下载的 .vbox-extpak 文件。\n\r\n点击 “安装Install”。接受条款，并为安装提供管理员密码。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n安装成功后，可以在已安装列表中看到。\n\r\n重启主机系统。重启是强制性的。\n\r\n在客体机中启用 USB\n\r\n将 U 盘插入你的宿主机系统，你希望从虚拟机中访问该系统。\n\r\n启动 VirtualBox 并右键单击要启用 USB 的虚拟机名称。选择“设置Settings”。\n\r\n\n\r\n在左窗格中，单击 USB。然后选择控制器版本。例如，你可以选择 USB 3.0。然后单击小加号图标添加 USB 过滤器。\n\r\n在此列表中，你应该看到你的 U 盘名称（你插入的）。对于这个例子，我可以看到我插入的 Transcend Jetflash 驱动器。\n\r\n选择它并按 “OK”。\n\r\n\n\r\n现在，启动你的虚拟机。打开文件管理器，你应该会看到 U 盘已启用并挂载到你的虚拟机上。\n\r\n在此演示中，你可以看到我的 Arch-Xfce 虚拟机的 Thunar 文件管理器正在显示我的 U 盘中的内容。\n\r\n\n\r\n使用说明\n\r\n现在，这里有几件事你应该记住。\n\r\n当你在主机系统中插入 U 盘时，请保持挂载状态。但在启动虚拟机之前不要打开或访问任何文件。\n\r\n启动虚拟机后，U 盘将在主机系统中卸载并自动挂载到客体系统中，即你的虚拟机。\n\r\n使用完 U 盘后，确保在虚拟机中将其弹出或卸载。然后它将能再从你的主机系统内访问。\n\r\n总结\n\r\nVirtualBox 是一个功能强大的程序，提供易于使用的功能来设置的你虚拟机。这些步骤很简单，并确保你的 U 盘在主机系统中被正确检测到以正常工作。\n\r\n另外，请记住，通过扩展包检测 U 盘与 VirtualBox 客户端增强包无关。它们完全不相关并提供独立的功能。\n\r\n最后，如果本指南对你有帮助，请在评论栏中告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/enable-usb-virtualbox/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Audacity 是一个自由开源的跨平台 音频编辑器。专业人士使用它是因为它提供的功能仅需安装很小的软件包。\n\r\n你不必成为一名专业人士并使用它的所有功能。你可以使用它从麦克风录制音频，并执行一些基本操作，如背景噪声消除。\n\r\n我将在本教程中向你展示如何做到这一点。\n\r\n在 Linux 上安装 Audacity\n\r\n在 Linux 上安装 Audacity 是一个非常简单的过程。由于其受欢迎，可以在大多数 Linux 发行版的官方存储库中找到它。\n\r\n你可以在发行版的软件中心或软件包管理器中搜索它。\n\r\n作为一个终端爱好者，让我分享一下常见发行版的命令。\n\r\n对于基于 Debian 或 Ubuntu 的发行版：\n\r\nsudo apt install audacity\r\n\n\r\n对于基于 RHEL 或 Fedora 的发行版：\n\r\nsudo dnf install audacity\r\n\n\r\n如果你在用基于 Arch 的发行版：\n\r\nsudo pacman -Syu audacity\r\n\n\r\n注意，通过官方存储库安装可能无法获得 最新版本。要获得最新版本，你可以使用 AppImage 或 Flatpak/Snap 软件包。\n\r\n使用 Audacity 录制音频\n\r\n安装 Audacity 后，从应用程序菜单打开它或从终端启动它。你会看到这样的界面：\n\r\n\n\r\n单击“录制”按钮（红点）即可轻松开始录制。完成后，单击“ 停止”按钮（方形图标）来结束录制。你还可以预览录制的波形，如下所示：\n\r\n\n\r\n然后，你可以通过单击“播放”按钮（绿色图标）检查录制的内容。\n\r\n如果你没有看到任何波形，则表示未录制到任何内容。很可能，你没有正确设置音频输入。确保你选择了正确的麦克风，并确保在“系统设置system settings”中其未被静音。你也可以通过 Audacity 接口设置。\n\r\n录音不会自动保存为 MP3 或其他格式。要保存录音，你可以转到 “文件File → 导出Export” 并选择 “导出为 MP3Export as MP3”（或任何其他想要的格式）。\n\r\n使用 Audacity 降低背景噪声\n\r\nAudacity 还有另一个很棒的功能，你可以使用它来减少录制音频中的白噪声。\n\r\n最好的做法是在开始使用 Audacity 录制时的前五秒不要说任何话。这将为你提供所需的背景噪声。\n\r\n在录制音频的波形上，选择你认为是背景噪声的部分。\n\r\n\n\r\n选择噪声部分后，从顶部文件菜单中转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”。\n\r\n它会像这样打开一个弹出窗口。单击此处的 “获取噪音配置文件Get Noise Profile”。\n\r\n\n\r\n现在，你已经设置了噪声配置文件。现在，你必须使用它来减少录音中的噪声。\n\r\n按 Ctrl + A 快捷键选择整段录音。你也可以选择其中的一部分，仅对所选部分减少噪声。\n\r\n选择音轨后，再次转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”。\n\r\n这次不要单击 “获取噪音配置文件Get Noise Profile”。这一次，你应该能够按下 “OK” 按钮。\n\r\n只需按下 “OK” 按钮，即可将降噪效果应用到录音中，并反映在波形上，如下所示：\n\r\n\n\r\n现在，相较而言，录制的音频将具有更少的噪声。你可以在选择 “降低噪音Noise Reduction” 效果时微调噪声过滤。\n\r\n总结如下：\n\r\n\r\n选择噪声部分，转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”，然后单击 “获取噪音配置文件Get Noise Profile”\n\r\n按 Ctrl + A 选择整段音频录制，转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”，这次按 OK 按钮\n\r\n\r\n请注意，你无法移除所有类型的噪声，但这应该会有所帮助。\n\r\nAudacity 能做更多事情\n\r\n使用 Audacity 录制音频可能不像使用 GNOME 录音机那样简单，但它并不太复杂。如果你正在录制画外音，降噪功能将非常有用。\n\r\nAudacity 有更多其他功能，不可能在一个教程中涵盖所有这些功能。这就是为什么我会保持简短的原因。\n\r\n如果你不能接受 2021 年的 Audacity 的隐私政策调整，试试其他可用的工具。\n\r\n我希望这个小教程能帮助你使用 Audacity 进行音频录制。如果你有问题或建议，请告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/audacity-recording/\n\r\n作者：Anuj Sharma 选题：lkxed 译者：FYJNEVERFOLLOWS 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "前言\n环保问题一直是装修中大家密切关注的重点，毕竟即使选择E1\\E0\\F4级材料，新家具、新柜子都会有气味不断散发出来。装修材料内部和连接处使用的胶会不断分解，散发出醛类、苯系物等挥发性有机物，它们会对人体呼吸系统以及血液系统造成影响。\n\n所以新房通风散味除甲醛是每个家庭都重视的，我的房子次顶楼、南北通，楼前无遮挡，整体通风效果是非常好的。8月初定制柜安装完毕后，我就持续不关窗通风，10月中旬成品家具也正式入屋，后继续通风。两大新房空气污染源分别经过了3个月和一个月的连续通风，如今进入屋内的异样气味感已经明显减少了，为了确定新房的空气质量，计划开展新房空气的自测。\n甲醛检测的国标方法\n\n现在关注室内甲醛的人都知道，国标允许的室内甲醛最高浓度为0.10mg/m³，可靠的测试标准为GB/T 18204.26-2000《公共场所空气中甲醛测定方法》。\n检测的原理就是让空气中的甲醛与酚试剂反应生成嗪，嗪在酸性溶液中杯高铁例子氧化形成蓝绿色化合物，根据其颜色的深浅，以分光光度计检测标准溶液后进行比色，进而给出定量的检测结果。这一方法对醛类物质有很好的选择性，结果可靠。\n从化学角度来讲，这个是非常简单的测定实验，检测结果可靠的核心就是要有严格按照标准规定进行取样，吸收液配置准确，以及有计量溯源可靠的分光光度计和标准物质作为数据支撑。\n即使其它检测手段能向国标检测方法的结果进行标定，那也没有分光光度法的可靠性和准确度。\n分光光度法之所以准，是因为国标明确说明，仅有二氧化硫会对这方法的检测结果造成影响，一般家庭不存在二氧化硫。\n室内甲醛测试的手段与经济投入\n1：甲醛测试盒\n\n甲醛测试盒就是简易版的酚试剂测试法，可以不需要分光光度计，每份测试盒内带有酚试剂吸收液，自行根据指导方法封闭房间，摆放吸收液半小时后，倒入铁酸溶液，显色后对比测试盒内附带的比色卡，以肉眼充当分光光度计，来判断颜色情况。…",

          "description": "最近，我在尝试使用画图思考。虽然只是简单应用，但是收获颇丰，值得梳理总结出来。 我会从电脑和本子两个方面来说说自己的实践。\n电脑\n电脑软件上，我来说说 Excalidraw 和 Craft 这两款应用。\nExcalidraw\n\n说到画图，Excalidraw 这个应用肯定绕不过。我在电脑上的思路梳理，知识分享，还有学习的沉淀，都在高度依赖这个应用。它是一款在线的白板软件，风格和字体偏手绘风格，我很享受在上面涂涂画画的过程。\n\n思路梳理的时候，我会把自己的问题先写在白板上，然后自由发散，记录下现状。接下来，我会通过观察画布上的一个个关键字，去做分类的和关联的操作。在动手的过程中，很可能一些思路就已经慢慢出来。画布可以很好承载网状的思考，通过拖拽，连线，分层，让我在脑子里混乱的思绪，一步步清晰。如果看着画布上的关键字，一时没有找到解决方案，也不用着急，就安静观察，静下心来，慢慢琢磨。\n\n和朋友分享观点或知识，我亦经常在这个白板上画图。有了白板，我们讨论问题的时候，可以把一些发散的问题记录到一个位置，等主要内容分享完之后，回头继续梳理。白板的展示方式，可以更好吸引对方的兴趣和注意力。我也经常感受到，在和别人交流过程中画图，会不知不觉，产生一个新的观点，或者对自己的思路愈发清晰。\n\n最后说说学习的沉淀，抛开做笔记，我最喜欢的就是面对这个白板做知识的总结。写作困难的地方也许是从零开始，梳理知识应该也是。没有参考的情况下，列出知识大纲，结构化总结，是一件困难的事情。就是这种每次面对白板的梳理，让我可以更好检视自己的学习成果。同时，白板画图，使我我对分层学习，有了更直观的感受。\nCraft\nCraft 是一款笔记应用。这款应用好在配图和分享非常方便流畅。我在分享给朋友的一些文字上，会配上一张图片。不要小看文章或者句子的配图，这个配图如果合适，会加深对句子的印象。\n\n除了分享的配图，我还会在学习专业书籍时，对目录大纲做一个梳理，同样会配上方便我联想记忆的图片。看目录标题，思考关联图片，搜索图片，然后上传图片到 Craft 的过程，虽然繁琐，但实在是一劳永逸的事情。我回顾知识框架的时候，一看到图片，就会很自然想到，自己当时为什么选择了这种图，这张图含义是什么，大部分都可以直接根据图片，推敲出章节标题。\n\n找图片，激发自己使用右脑联想记忆，这个过程其实步骤很多。经常遇到找不到合适的图片来表达，在这时，我会在 Excalidraw 上画图。过程虽然花费不少时间，但是在这个思考和主动寻找关联关系的过程，其实已经在慢慢消化和记忆知识。\n\n本子\n便利贴\n我把便利贴当作一个有边界的草稿纸。我在想一些细碎问题的时候，会打开便利贴画一下思路和草图，一个问题，不会超过一张便利贴去思考。举个例子，上周的茶话会，分享前，我在便利贴上圈圈点点，画出大纲和思路。随后我把便利贴揉成一团丢掉，暗示自己思路已经准备就绪。\n\n便利贴的天然边界，和撕下来的特性，很好地辅助了我思考。生活中很多问题会突然出现，便利贴的便利性，就是良好的应对方式。它的第一页，在安静等待着你写写画画，接着被你撕下。一页便利贴没有过多的空间，这个特点，帮助我自然而然去聚焦问题的重点。\n子弹笔记\n为了让生活中很多琐事更有趣，我会在子弹笔记上，用画图的方式去给自己分配任务。比如，清理卧室，衣柜部分很多衣服需要清点，我就会把衣柜的实物画出来。当我清理完一部分格子，我会用荧光笔涂上颜色。\n我在实践中，体会到画图的三个优点。首先是直观，无论是进度还是已经完成的程度，我一眼看上去，都有直观的感知。其次是低压力，看图片去想自己要做什么，和看清单上的文字，压力不一样。最后是愉悦感，看图的时候，因为低压力和直观，让我做事的时候心情更好。\n\n除了通过画图拆分任务，我还使用荧光笔快速分类子弹笔记中的任务。比如，某一天傍晚，我打算采购想要购买的东西。由于子弹笔记是一般是按照流水线的方式记录要任务，我的本子上没有一个页面或者清单专门记录。\n\n很自然地，我拿起某个颜色的荧光笔，在本子上把这几天未完成的购买任务，涂上同样的颜色。很短的时间内，我就快速把购买的东西过滤出来，然后拿出手机去一件件下单。\n总结\n\n从电脑上的画图实践，我学习到，多画图可以捋清思路。合适的配图，能加深印象。在本子上的实践，我学习到便利贴的边界能辅助快速思考。最后是，眼睛，分辨颜色和形状效率很高。\n我的实践，如标题所言，确实非常简单。即便如此，这些实践也不是我自己凭空想象。《认知心理学》《游戏改变世界》《子弹整理思考术》《活用一辈子的读书笔记术》《一页纸工作整理术》，这五本书对我启发很大。学习和生活，都离不开知行合一。希望自己能够在成长的路上，多实践，多沉淀。",

          "description": "人要坚持一件事情真的很难，一不小心，少数派思考就鸽了一个多月。上周六我上了一次「得到」的直播，也是罗振宇老师的年度演讲策划会，在会上我提出了两个观点，在这里跟大家分享一下。\n用实业心态创业，用实业思维做互联网产品\n这句话其实在我脑海中已经很多年了，可能跟我之前从事的传统行业有关系。不管是做哪个行业和产品，我都非常在意它给用户提供的本质价值，比如我推销过纳米汽车清洁产品，就会一直纠结它的实际效果怎么样，不断反馈问题；我出口过弹簧钢丝，也更关注海外客户的使用反馈，了解我们的工艺跟其他国家的差距在哪里。\n但互联网的兴起，好像改变了这些底层规则，因为要快、要规模、所以要免费，羊毛要出在猪身上。不知不觉，服务和产品的本质都被动摇了。我非常感恩互联网，因为这个工具和时代，让给我有了创业的机会，帮我把爱好变成了事业，但我不迷信互联网，它是一个好工具，但不是产品和服务的本质。\n简单举两个例子：\n今天的外卖让我们的餐饮高效便利，但餐饮的本质是菜品和味道，如果菜品难吃又不干净，你送餐的速度的再快也没有意义，我能忍一次两次，忍不了第三次。\n今天的娱乐，让我们随时随地可以听音乐，看电影，但平台的争斗和互卷，让创作者无奈，让好的内容越来越少，最终变得没什么可看了。\n所以，一个产品和服务，要想保持长期可持续的生命力，就要回归用户需求，用实业思维把东西夯实，夯成自己的真正壁垒，它可能会很慢，规模也不大，但它可以穿越周期，做成百年老店。接下来十年，可能是一个慢下来的新周期，这个思维就更加重要。\n直播中有一个提前准备的问题，没来得及讲，我可以在这里补充一下：\n当下环境，你会给准备创业的朋友哪些建议和叮嘱？\n先想好怎样活下来，今天的市场更加残酷，没有红利、没有资本，用户更谨慎和挑剔。\n少讲故事，如果你的业务短期内没法商业化，就要想好长期策略，比如控制成本，小步快跑等等。\n别追风口，多关注细分市场的机会，关注年轻的主力消费人群，未来是创意和个性化的时代。\n不要社恐，不要闭门造车，要主动联络和运用身边的一切资源。\n创新不是颠覆，是将好做到优秀，再把优秀做成经典的过程\n这句话不是我说的，而是来自 150 年历史的德国莱茵公司。三年前我前往德国参观了他们的公司和业务，七天行程的结束，莱茵大中华区电子电气副总裁 Jay 总结了这句话，引发了我的思考。\n巧合的是，我八年前做出口业务的时候，有很多欧洲的客户，我去了解他们的背景，发现大多都是做了几十年的企业。他们都是深耕自己的领域，比如一家制造扫街刷子的公司，从塑料制刷改成钢丝刷，从扫街到扫管道，不停优化工艺，不停的延伸拓展，始终保持自己的市场地位。\n而互联网时代，我们经常讲创新，讲颠覆，强调一个技术出现，就会改变一个行业，我就是这个行业的佼佼者。我们承认趋势的存在，但趋势是波浪，一旦过去了，你还要靠自己的实力去创造价值，只是这个趋势周期比较长，我们还没有真正经历和感受过低谷。\n所以我后来一直思考这句话，它可能就是一个百年企业的运营真谛，不要觉得事情小，而是关注它的价值。150 年前的莱茵公司，是给蒸汽锅炉做安全认证的，因为品质不统一，操作不规范，它经常出现致命的事故，先做好这件事，保证工人的生命安全。后面再一点点拓展到更多的领域，最后形成了人人信赖的品牌。\n做一份少数派的报告\n虽然，以上这些海外企业的成长经历，跟我们的周期和环境有很大区别，但我依然认同这些底层的观点：把一件事情做好做透，拥有你最核心的用户群，先完成你基本的商业闭环，然后再围绕用户和市场的需求去慢慢拓展。这跟以往的互联网思维是基本相悖的，但从更高的维度和更长的周期来看，我依然相信这是正确的。\n我们在直播中聊到，是不是可以整理一个具备这些特质的企业清单，讲讲他们的故事，我们可以把它叫做真正的《少数派报告》，也希望这些案例，能在寒冬之中，引领更多创业者找到自己的方向。",

          "description": "虽然现在多屏用户逐渐变多，但仍是小众，Windows 也并没过对多屏使用进行太多的优化。所以只好自己动手，于是有了以下一些个人自用的优化设置。\n窗口出现位置优化\nWindows 系统仅对多屏用户提供了简单主显示器的设置，默认情况下所有新打开的窗口都只会出现在主显示器上，即使你在使用另一个的显示器。而「基于显示器连接记住窗口位置」只能记住上次关闭时所在的屏幕，实用性并不高。\n\n这时微软自家的 Power Toys 里的 FancyZones 就可以派上用场了，除了我们熟知的窗口布局设置外，它还可以调整窗口行为，在这里我们可以通过启用「将新创建的窗口移动到当前 活动的监视器（实验性）」来达到这一效果，美中不足的是动画不够优雅。\n\n窗口出现的问题解决了，但任务栏上默认是显示所有屏幕上的窗口，不能让我们快速区分哪些应用是在当前屏幕下的。\n\n为了解决该问题，如下图所示，Windows 提供了简陋的选项加让人摸不着头脑的翻译。设置后，每个屏幕下的任务栏就只显示当前屏幕下打开的窗口，更符合直觉，不过 Win + 数字 的快捷键就只能在主显示器上使用了。\n\n内容显示优化\n现在 Windows 下大部分的应用都适配高 DPI 的，少部分不支持的，也可以通过 Windows 自带的属性 - 兼容性选项来调整。\n\n上面的设置仅解决了单个应用在高分辨率屏幕下的问题，并不能解决应用在分辨率相差太大的显示器间移动时会出现界面变形问题。这时，如果你使用的 AMD 显卡，那你可以通过启用 AMD Radeon Software 里的「超虚拟分辨率」来让低分辨率屏切换到更高的逻辑分辨率，不仅缩小的多屏间的分辨率差距，还有抗锯齿的效果。由于个人没有使用 Nvidia 和 Intel 显卡，相关选项是否存在请自行到显卡设置里翻找。\n\n设置完成后到 Windows 设置调整下逻辑分辨率和缩放即可。\n\n除此之外，对于我们网上冲浪必备的浏览器，它的缩放是固定的，且只有一个设置选项。不知道有没有人跟我一样两个屏幕的缩放比例是不一样的，在两个屏幕间移动浏览器时，网页内容并不会根据 DPI 而变化，导致观感割裂。在这里我推荐一个 FireFox 浏览器插件：ffreszoom，它可以实时感知屏幕宽度的变化，当宽度超过指定值时，自动调整到指定缩放比例。设置前先通过这个网站查看自己的屏幕宽度：http://whatismyscreenresolution.net/，需要将 Firefox 浏览器移动到不同显示器上刷新。\n\n如图所示我的外屏宽度是 1728 px，笔记本内屏为 1024，所以我在两者之间随意取了一个值用于判断，若当前屏幕宽度超过 1600 px，就自动设置缩放为 1.5，也即 150%。若小于 1600 px，则使用浏览器设置里的值。两种缩放无缝切换，只会多了一个缩放的动画。由于本人没使用 Chromium 类浏览器，并没有对应的插件推荐，不过其用户这么多，应该会有类似的插件。\n\n利用「闲置的」触摸板\n不知有没有跟我一样喜欢使用笔记本键盘的，且平时一些简单的操作直接用触摸板直接操作。现在 Windows 11 已经支持自定义触摸板多指手势了，但其不能根据不同应用设置不同的手势，例如：A 软件可以用 Ctrl  + W 关闭，但 B 软件只能用 Alt + F4，同一个操作有不同的快捷键。\n\n这时就需要第三方软件了，这里我推荐 GestureSign，界面虽然是 Windows 10 风格，但不影响使用，毕竟设置完就不用再看了。它可以为不同应用的不同快捷键键设置相同的触控手势，手势类型也不再仅限于横平竖直，可以自由发挥。同时软件也内置了一些常用的命令供选择。\n\n上图是我的一些设置，双指一般使用系统默认就不添加上去了。其中个人最爱的是三指滑动切换标签，体验比鼠标点击更加符合人的直觉。对于频繁使用搜索启动器的我，把三指上滑指定为搜索启动器的快捷键，方便呼出。\n \n对了，设置前记得把系统自带的相关手势取消掉，不然会冲突。若你仍不习惯使用触摸板，该软件也支持鼠标手势，具体可以自行下载体验。\n结尾\n以上便是我在使用多屏时遇到的问题，及相关解决方法，希望对多屏用户有帮助。",

You can use an array to store information in a structured way. It's useful to know the various ways you can retrieve that data when you need it. It's worth noting that in Java, an associative array (also called a dictionary in some languages) is called a hashmap. This article doesn't cover hashmaps, but you can read all about them in my Using a hashmap in Java article.\nCreating a string array\nThe simplest array in Java is a one-dimensional array.

While working on a scheduler web application, I realized that there were no good solutions for electronic program guides (EPG) and scheduling. Admittedly, this is a niche feature for most web developers, but it's a common requirement for TV applications. I've seen and analyzed a number of websites that have implemented their own EPG or timeline, and I often wondered why everyone seemed to be inventing their own solutions instead of working on a shared solution everyone could use. And that's when I started developing Planby.\nPlanby is a React (JavaScript) component to help you create schedules, ti…",

Chances are, whoever committed the bug didn't declare it in their Git commit message.

This is the problem that git bisect was built to solve!\nThe git bisect command is a powerful tool that quickly checks out a commit halfway between a known good state and a known bad state and then asks you to identify the commit as either good or bad.

A longer answer touches on where C stands among programming languages in general and towards Rust in particular. C, C++, and Rust are systems languages, which give programmers access to machine-level data types and operations. Among these three systems languages, C remains the dominant one. The kernels of modern operating systems are written mainly in C, with assembly language accounting for the rest.

Musk described the new manual authentication process as “painful, but necessary.” Verified check marks will also be expanded with additional colors — gold for companies, grey for the government, and the original blue for individual accounts.\nAs it turns out, offering so-called verified check marks for an $8 monthly subscription without actually verifying identities wasn’t a brilliant idea.
