          "description": "Context\n\n\nWhether you're a Developer or SRE or DevOps - when you're tasked with setting up logging, there are essentially two options:\nSetup an indexing based search engine, masquerading as log storage. Such products are difficult to deploy and run in longer term - manage indexes, local and remote storage, different node types and so on. \nAdditionally, indexing in the ingestion flow causes high CPU and Memory consumption, while denying very high ingestion rates.\nAlternatively, pay for an exorbitantly costly SaaS platform that is very easy to get started with. As time grows, data volumes and costs increase. \nBut data gravity means getting out of this platform is difficult and you end up storing a fraction of log data to save costs. \nWe dealt with both these options in our work and we know both these options are not ideal. This pushed us to think what would a modern, cloud native, log storage and observability platform look like.\nIt is clear that log storage of future won't be another index based search engine in a new language.\nWe set out to build a completely indexing free log storage platform. This led to Parseable.\nParseable is a simple, efficient and fast log storage and observability platform. Think the simplicity of Prometheus but for Logs. Written in Rust, Parseable leverages Apache Arrow, Parquet and widely available object storage platforms for efficiency, cost effectiveness and performance.\nIt is compatible with standard logging agents like FluentBit, LogStash etc. Parseable also offers a builtin, intuitive GUI for log query and analysis.\n\nAs we launched Parseable, we see tremendous interest in the community to try this out. We'd love for you to try out Parseable and we're all ears for any questions, feedback, and comments. \nGet Started: https://www.parseable.io/docs/quick-start\nhttps://launchpass.com/parseable\nhttps://github.com/parseablehq/parseable\nhttps://www.parseable.io/docs/introduction",

This problem caused an initial week of study of the code base and the domain.\nThis application was based on Next.js so with Server Side Rendering (SSR) architecture and this was another big mistake we noticed. As I mentioned before this application is for back-office users (not public available) so we didn't enjoy all the features of a SSR (SEO, etc. etc.) and we were struggling with slow page transitions, complex caching and server cost.\nReact\n\n\nWe decided to migrate the project to React + Vite because Next.js framework is based on top of React ecosystem. \nUsually, we load the information to render through APIs so a good tip is to start JavaScript -> TypeScript conversion from them. With this first step, the rest of the work can be trivial.\nHere are some results of this refactoring:\nit's cheaper because it's hosted a cloud Storage\nless exception in production (❤️ TypeScript)\n35% faster than its predecessor (smaller bundle size)\nCI/CD pipeline is 50% faster 🚀 \nthe code base is easy to navigate and it's easier to implement new features\nIt was a long journey anyway benefits are massive.\nI hope this article inspires you, don't forget to give ❤️ if you like it.

The organization of manual tests teams – V-cycle\n\nIn this model, the further upstream the steps are, the later the validation of the step. This observation was made by experts who wanted to implement ‘Shift Left’, which is used to detect anomalies as early as possible, by implementing processes such as reviews. As a reminder, reviews are processes for verifying written deliverables that can be adapted to a wide range of subjects such as code, specifications, scripted tests…\nIn addition to late testing, the V-Cycle offers other problems. The delivery cycles are long and thus limit the number of deliveries per year (often between one and four). The specific test ‘phases’ also take place in a very punctual manner. Another issue arises with SUTs (System U…",

          "description": "Penpot 是一个自由开源的解决方案，能够替代 Figma 或类似的设计工具。你怎么看？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nAdobe 以高达 200 亿美元的价格收购了流行的设计工具 Figma。\n\r\n像往常一样，大型科技公司通过收购企业来消除竞争。因此，这并不完全是一个令人兴奋的消息。\n\r\n但是，令人兴奋的是，我们遇到了一个自由开源的设计工具，它从 Figma 中获得灵感并且做得更好！\n\r\nPenpot：正在开发中的自由开源的设计工具\n\r\n\n\r\nPenpot enpot 是一个正在积极开发的开源项目。将近两年前，它在 ProductHunt 上推出，目前处于测试阶段。\n\r\nPenpot 值得关注的地方：\n\r\n\r\n自由开源（当然）。\n\r\n可以选择自托管。\n\r\n跨平台。\n\r\n使用 SVG 作为原生格式。\n\r\n基于 Web。\n\r\n具有行业标准功能（受 Figma 启发）。\n\r\n\r\n你可以观看其官方视频以了解其基础知识：\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nPenpot 的主要亮点是使用 SVG 作为其原生格式。使用 SVG 文件，你可以获得与许多矢量图形编辑工具很好的兼容性。\n\r\n因此，你保存下来的文件，同样可以被其他的图片编辑软件打开，而不会被其专有的格式锁定在一个特定的软件上。\n\r\nPenpot 为你提供绝对最佳的开放标准。\n\r\nPenpot 的 CEO，Pablo Ruiz-Múzquiz 提到了更多：\n\r\n\r\n如果你在存储层面上采用 SVG（开放标准，支持 Web，移动互联网等），你马上就可以将你所有的 Penpot 设计与你的代码库整合起来。由于采用了 SVG 而不是另一种封闭的格式，你可以对设计本身的实际表现进行修改。这为设计师和开发人员打开了巨大的机会之门。另外，SVG 意味着我们免费地就为低代码提供了支持。你可以在 Penpot 中选择任何元素并查看它的 SVG（和 CSS）形式，知道它实际上是什么，无需翻译。这给设计师和开发人员之间带来了更值得信赖的关系，并允许前端开发人员尝试他们的设计技能。\n\r\n\r\n所以，使用 SVG 作为原生格式有很多优势！\n\r\n目前，该项目处于测试阶段，且在项目中有大量熟练的贡献者不断改进。\n\r\n这可以让它变成 Figma 最有用的开源替代品，让设计工具突破了大型技术公司。\n\r\n你可以自行托管它或使用云应用程序对其进行测试。在其官方网站上注册以学习和试验它。\n\r\n你还可以查看其 GitHub 页面 以探索更多信息。\n\r\n\r\nPenpot\n\r\n\r\n这也让我想起了 Akira，它的目标是成为一个用于 UI 和 UX 设计的原生 Linux 应用程序。它仍处于早期开发阶段，但当涉及 Linux 或开源计划时，这种努力总是受到赞赏。\n\r\n💬 你如何看待 Penpot 作为 Figma 的开源替代品？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/penpot-figma-alternative/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lkxed 译者：littlebirdnest 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "在开始编写应用之前，为手机、物联网设备和边缘计算定义无线更新计划。\n\r\n\r\n过去对系统的更新相对简单。当开发人员需要修改他们已经分发给公众的东西时，会发布一个更新程序供人们运行。用户将运行更新程序，允许用新文件替换旧文件并添加新文件。然而，即使有了这些“相对简单”的更新，也有一个问题。当用户安装好的系统处于意外状态时会发生什么？升级中断时会发生什么？当各种设备都在线时，这些问题同样重要，有时需要重要的安全更新。今天的许多更新都是通过无线、空中下载技术over-the-air（OTA）的方式提供的，连接不良、信号突然丢失或断电的可能性可能会对应该是次要更新的内容造成灾难性的影响。这些是你在计划提供 OTA 更新时需要考虑的三大策略。\n\r\n1、验证\n\r\nTCP 协议内置了很多验证功能，因此当你 向设备发送数据包 时，通常可以确信每个数据包都已完好无损地收到。但是，TCP 无法报告它不知道的错误，因此由你来验证以下内容：\n\r\n\r\n你是否已发送更新所需的所有文件？设备无法接收没有发送的内容。\n\r\n收到的文件和你发送的文件一样吗？至少，检查 SHA 和以验证文件完整性。\n\r\n如果可能，请使用 数字签名 确保文件来自受信任的来源。\n\r\n在允许更新开始之前，你必须验证设备能够应用更新。在提交更新之前检查权限和电池状态，并确保你的更新过程覆盖任何意外的用户事件，例如计划的重新启动或休眠。\n\r\n最后，你必须验证声称已成功完成的更新是否已实际完成。在将更新正式标记为系统已完成之前，请检查目标设备上的文件位置和完整性。\n\r\n\r\n2、回退和故障状态\n\r\n更新的最坏情况是设备处于损坏状态，以至于它甚至不能继续被中止的更新。在这种情况下，更新程序文件存在于目标设备上，但该过程已被中断。这可能会使设备处于未知状态，其中一些文件已被更新版本替换，而其他文件尚未被替换。在最坏的情况下，已更新的文件与尚未更新的文件不兼容，因此设备无法按预期运行。\n\r\n有一些策略可以解决这个问题。初始更新步骤可能是安装专用于完成更新的特殊引导镜像或环境，并在系统上设置“标志”以确认更新正在进行中。这样可以确保即使设备在更新过程中突然断电，更新过程也会在下次启动时重新启动。仅在验证更新后才删除表示更新成功的标志。\n\r\n根据目标设备的安全策略和你要更新的内容，特殊的引导镜像可能不可行或不需要。不过，原理还是一样的。当启动后，更新必须建立一个环境，在这个环境中，待处理的更新是解决问题之前的唯一途径\n\r\n但是，在更新被授予启动权限之前，用户（如果有的话）应该能够延迟或忽略更新。\n\r\n3、附加更新\n\r\n在许多边缘和物联网设备中，目标设备的底层是不可变的。更新只会添加到系统的已知状态。 Fedora Silverblue 之类的项目正在证明这种模式可以在许多领域发挥作用，因此这种奢侈的做法可能会变得司空见惯。不过，在那之前，成功应用更新的一部分是了解你将要影响的环境。\n\r\n不过，你不需要不可变的核心来应用附加更新。你可以构建一个使用相同概念的系统，将更新作为添加库或包的一种方式，而无需修改旧版本。作为此类更新的最后一步，具有更新路径的可执行文件是你所做的唯一实际修订。\n\r\nOTA 更新\n\r\n世界越来越无线化。对于手机、物联网设备和 边缘计算，OTA 更新通常是唯一的选择。实施 OTA 更新策略需要仔细规划并仔细考虑不可能的情况。你最了解你的目标设备，因此请在开始编码之前规划好你的更新架构。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/9/plan-ota-updates-edge\n\r\n作者：Alan Smithee 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "起初，我从未感受到我妈对于衰老的恐惧。直到大概五六年前我家重新装修房子的时候，我妈坚持要在他们卧室的厕所里装一个马桶，后来问了原因才知道，她大概是觉得以后自己老了，万一腿脚不方便了，用马桶会轻松很多。从那一刻起，我才猛然发觉这种隐秘的恐惧。\n第七次全国人口普查的的数据显示，目前中国60岁及以上的人口数量已超2.6亿，这个人数占总人数的18.7%。这就意味着，有相当一部分老人正在经历着这种关于衰老的隐秘恐惧，还会有越来越多的人陷入这种关于衰老的恐惧。\n为了回应这些恐惧，很多人可能最先想到的是“适老化改造”。当然，适老化改造是一个相当大的问题域，本文目前所要探讨的仅仅是房屋的适老化改造，特别是对现有的城镇房屋进行一些“修补性”的适老化改造。\n为什么要进行房屋适老化改造？\n我们需要先回答一个问题：为什么我们要率先对“房屋”这样一个区域进行适老化改造呢？这个问题的答案有很多。\n首先是出于目前国内养老格局的考虑。国内养老事业呈现出一种所谓的“9073”的格局。也就是说，90%左右的老年人居家养老，大约7%的老年人需要依托社区进行养老，最后3%左右的老年人将入住养老院。这意味着大多数老人会在自己的家中度过大部分的晚年时光。这几乎是最适合老人，同时也是最经济的养老方式。\n其次是出于老人活动范围的考虑。随着年龄的增长，老人的社会活动范围会逐渐缩小，老人对于居住空间的依赖程度也会越来越高。这意味着，居住环境成为老人晚年生活最重要的空间载体，居住条件的好坏将会直接影响老人的生活质量。[1]\n再次是出于老年人人体工学的考虑。据老年人人体工学的研究，在衰老过程中人体的尺寸也会发生变化。医学研究资料显示：人在28-30岁时身高最高，35-40岁之后逐渐出现衰减，70岁时身高会比年轻时减少2.5%-3%。[2]这就意味着，随着居住者年龄的增长，房屋也应该发生一些改变。\n所以，出于上述的种种原因，除了大…",

          "description": "小众消息的冯大辉前两天推送了一篇很有意思的文章，大概是探讨一个B站视频对微信存储机制可能存在的误解。文中提出了一个实验方法，看到做了试验可能会有奖品，我眼睛一下放光，不如就趁此机会做几个试验，好好探讨一下微信在iOS上的文件存储机制，包括：\n\n转发文件是否会占用额外的存储空间？\n从同一人处多次接收同一份文件是否会占用额外的空间？\n从不同人处多次接收同一份文件是否会占用额外的空间？\n微信和WeChat在以上这些问题上是否存在差异？\n同一台手机上的不同微信账号接收的同一文件是否占用额外存储空间？\n\n试验的环境是iOS 14.8.1、iPhone 11、微信8.0.28。首先我们删除手机上的微信重新安装。登录一个WeChat小号（小号A）。此时微信占用的空间是少的可怜的752.2MB，其中数据占244.5MB。我提前准备好了一个Ubuntu的iso镜像（880MB）。将它发送给这个小号。下载后重启手机，可以看到，微信占用的空间变成了1.77GB，其中数据占1.26GB。多出来大约1GB的空间，可能是除了文件以外的缓存、其他需要的程序和资源文件。\n接收文件前后的微信\n接下来我们正式开始实验。我们讲接收到的文件转发给三个不同的小号。重启手机，可以看到，如冯大辉所料，微信所占用的存储空间并没有增加。依然是1.77GB（数据1.26GB)。微信显然做了最基本的文件存储去重。\n所占空间没有变化\n接下来，我从另一个微信号将刚刚发送的文件再次转发给小号三遍。当我点进新发送的文件时，看到需要接受文件，我有一种不详的预感。难道微信真会重新接收一遍文件？所幸，当我点击接收文件后，文件在一瞬间就接收完成了。显然，微信也伴有服务器端的去重，在服务器上的同一份文件，在本地并不会接收多次。重启手机也可以看到，微信占用的空间并无增加。\n看似要重新接收，实际所占空间没有明显变化\n按照这个逻辑，即使是不同的人转发给我的同一份文件，应该也不会需要重复下载，或是占用额外的空间。我试着用另外两个小号（小号B、小号C）将同一份文件转发给小号A。虽然也显示需要接收文件，但同刚才一样，一瞬间就完成了接收。再次重启手机，微信所占用的空间依旧没有变化。\n不过，刚才验证的情况中，虽然是多个账号转发给一个小号，但是微信很容易在服务器端追溯到，这些文件的源头是同一个。那假如各个账号是各自上传的同一份文件，微信在服务器端是否也有去重能力呢？为此，我在另一台小米手机上登录小号B与小号C，各自发送同一份文件给小号Ａ。发送文件的时间较长。这似乎足以让人判断出，微信大概没有类似百度网盘的文件去重判断。\n然而出人意料的是，小号A还是一瞬间就完成了文件的接收。重启手机后也可以看到，微信所占用的空间并没有明显增加（总计1.83GB，数据1.32GB）。这说明至少在服务器端，微信确实能够判断出一份文件是否曾经上传过。而缺少类似网盘的秒传功能，可能是微信本身没有相关功能，也可能是Android端微信需要优化。\n实际所占空间依然只有一份文件大小\n出于好奇，我又尝试从小号B发送一份内容相同，只有文件名不同的文件，看看微信的查重是否基于文件名，或是基于文件本身。经过等待漫长的发送，如我所料，接收只在一瞬间就完成了。由此可知，微信的文件去重基于内容，并不依赖名字。\n不同文件名也不会多占用空间\n上面测试的都是同一账号下的情况。那么，同一台手机上的不同账号间又是怎样呢？我尝试在刚刚登录小号A的手机上切换了一个微信账号B。可以看到，这次转发收到的相同文件，需要重新接收下载。重启手机也能看到微信的占用空间变为3.8G（数据3.29G）。不过在这一微信账号下，同一文件仍然只需要下载保存一份，再次收到就能秒存。同时利用这个微信账号简单试了一下，我发现以上WeChat的文件存储机制对微信也同样成立。\n实打实地需要下载，所占空间也倍增了\n到这里，我们可以基本得出结论，iOS的微信文件存储去重做得还是比较令人满意的。同一账号下的同一个文件，只要内容相同，就只会在本地留存一份。未来微信团队可以努力的方向是不同账号间的文件存储去重。\n另外值得一提的是，微信大概是真的有在代码层面实现去重，而非依赖APFS的CoW特性。因为即使只占一份空间，iPhone在统计容量时也会重复计算一个文件的多次拷贝。通过多次复制粘贴同一份文件，你能很容易地复现苹果的这个Bug：\n苹果什么时候出4T iPhone？\n在我原本的设想中，我写出这篇文章后，与其拿到那500元钱，我更想获得一个与Fenng交流的机会，说服他微信是一个糟糕的产品。但转念一下，即使我做到了，也并不能改变得了微信这个产品本身，以及我们必须使用它的环境。更何况再一看那篇文章，是要证明微信没有去重才能拿到那笔钱。是我审题不细了😀\n\n如果你觉得我的这篇文章不错，也欢迎你阅读我之前有关微信的两篇文章：虎头蛇尾的《微信戒断实验》与尝试减少微信占用空间的《微微微信怎么办》。",

It's deceptively easy to think of this setup as there being two \"sides\" of your router: On one side there's the Internet, and on the other, your devices.

          "description": "Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nEven when users tell YouTube they aren’t interested in certain types of videos, similar recommendations keep coming, a new study by Mozilla found.\nUsing video recommendations data from more than 20,000 YouTube users, Mozilla researchers found that buttons like “not interested,” “dislike,” “stop recommending channel,” and “remove from watch history” are largely ineffective at preventing similar content from being recommended. Even at their best, these buttons still allow through more than half the recommendations similar to what a user said they weren’t interested in, the report found. At their worst, the buttons barely made a dent in blocking similar videos.\nTo collect data from real videos and users, Mozilla researchers enlisted...\nContinue reading…",

          "description": "Put a disc in and play. | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nMicrosoft is making it easier to play games on your Xbox Series X, even if it’s offline — as of the 2208 update released earlier this month, you won’t be forced to do an online compatibility check to play a game from an Xbox One disc (via Windows Central). Instead, you can just pop the disc in, install the game, and play; no internet connection required.\nThe change, which isn’t listed as a feature of the 2208 update on Microsoft’s site, was confirmed by Xbox engineering lead Eden Marie, who tweeted that the check was removed because it wasn’t necessary “in the vast majority of cases” when playing a cross-generation game on the Series X.\nYes, this is true since the 2206 update.

          "description": "@yechezkel_rabinovich and the rest of our awesome team, we have created an APM that redefines cloud-native observability with the use of eBPF.\n\nNo engineer would question the importance of solid application monitoring in production. These tools help us sleep better at night, and solve that crazy sh*itstorm when it hits. And it always does.\n\nApplication monitoring solutions have taught us that we can have all the data we need to feel covered, all the time. Thing is, these solutions are so hard to integrate and they store so much data that they just can’t scale.\n\ngroundcover is here to disrupt the APM market and change the way these solutions work and operate.\n\nObservability should be a tool to help companies scale and thrive. We make it effortless and scalable for developers, so they can focus on what really matters - building world-changing products.\n\nWith groundcover you can instantly get:\n❇️ Logs from all across your cluster.\n❇️ Metrics with mind-blowing granularity such as API latency, error rate, and throughput.\n❇️ Traces from protocols like HTTP, gRPC, Redis, Kafka, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more.\n❇️ A map of all service dependencies.\n❇️ K8s infrastructure monitoring and tracking of K8s events.\n\nOh and we’re Prometheus-compatible, so if you’re working in Grafana we’re just a datasource away.\n\ngroundcover takes 1 minute to install on even the most heavy-duty K8s clusters.\n\nTry out our free-tier at www.groundcover.com; One day you’ll look back, and say that you were there when APM changed, for good.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
