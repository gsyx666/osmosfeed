Magic link and MFA coming soon.\n\n\nGraphQL API: A Hasura console is provided that GraphQL(ises) Postgres database. So there is no vendor lock-in like Firebase. You can move away when you want to.\n\n\nPostgres DB: An 8GB postgres DB is provided to you pre-configured\n\n\nServerless functions: Whatever extra functionality you want for your app can be coded here. You just need to connect your Github repo and we compile every push to master as an AWS Lambda function.\n\n\nSDKs to get you started. Plus lots of examples and starter kits.\n\n\n\nPlus it's open-source.\nI will soon be integrating AWS Appsync + Cognito (configuring and maintaining AWS is super hard. We do it for you) Soon be support for Stripe Payments. If you have a product in the DB, you can connect your stripe and payments and invoices will be taken care of.\nSo as you can see I am trying to build an all in one back-end service to resolve some of the most common pain points in configuring and managing the most used systems in the world (AWS, Stripe, GraphQL etc)",

The list I present is in no particular order, and I’m giving you my personal opinion on the keyboards and some facts.\nWhat are the best keyboards for programming? The one that works best for you!\nWith that said, let’s jump right into the list.\nA gaming keypad is a small, auxiliary keyboard designed only for gaming. It this the priority of every gamer or programmer to buy it.\nIt has a limited number of the original keys from a standard keyboard, and they are arranged in a more ergonomic fashion to facilitate quick and efficient gaming key presses.\nThis item is SteelSeries HP Omen X7Z97AA#ACJ Gaming Keyboard (Black). Zebronics Zeb-Transformer Gaming Keyboard and Mouse Combo (USB, Braided Cable). These are the best mechanical keyboard for coding in India.\nClick Here to get best keyboards for programming",

Let's fix that. \nOur touch handles should be draggable across our bar, position itself instantly when tapping on it and snap to the nearest value when the interaction is done.\nIn part 2 of this series we saw how to use gesture detectors. We could use detectTapGestures and detectDragGestures to achieve this. But since we want to do the more or less same thing when tapping or dragging, position the handle to the touch point, we can use the briefly mentioned awaitPointerEventScope to implement a more flexible and better fitting touch handler.\nWe can define the touch states we are interested in as a sealed class.\nsealed class TouchInteraction {\n    object NoInteraction : TouchInterac…",

          "description": "如果你使用的是 Ubuntu 22.04，你可能已收到过此通知。\n\r\n\n\r\n它会通知你 Firefox 更新正在等待中，并要求你关闭应用以避免中断。\n\r\n因此，就像一个听话的 Ubuntu 用户一样，你在保存或完成工作后关闭了 Firefox 浏览器。\n\r\n你认为 Firefox 已在后台更新，重启浏览器将运行较新版本。\n\r\n只是，并非如此。\n\r\n即使在你重启浏览器甚至计算机后，它仍可能显示相同的 “pending update of Firefox” 通知。\n\r\n令人沮丧么？我可以告诉你发生了什么。\n\r\n让我解释一下为什么会发生这种情况，以及你可以做些什么来“修复”它。\n\r\n修复 “pending update of Firefox snap” 问题\n\r\n早些时候，Firefox 曾经在后台更新，然后要求你重启浏览器。在你重启浏览器之前 不能 打开任何网站。\n\r\n\n\r\n在将 Firefox 浏览器切换为默认 Snap 包格式 后，Ubuntu 团队对更新流程进行了一些改动。\n\r\n此通知是“改进的用户体验”的一部分。现在，Firefox 不再阻止你浏览。你可以在方便时重新启动浏览器以进行更新。\n\r\n但是为什么即使在你重新启动浏览器或系统后它仍然显示这个通知？\n\r\n因为这是一条糟糕的通知消息，无法为你提供完整的信息。\n\r\nFirefox 更新还没有开始\n\r\n当你看到 “pending Firefox update” 时，你错误地认为应用已在后台更新，重启会将其升级到较新的版本。\n\r\n而对于现在这种情况，Ubuntu 中的 Snap 包每天会自动刷新（更新）一次或几次。为了避免在重新启动安装更新之前 Firefox 不允许你浏览任何内容而导致工作中断，Ubuntu 甚至不会在后台更新 Firefox Snap 包。\n\r\n相反，当 Snap 包刷新时，它会显示通知并希望你立即关闭浏览器，以便可以使用其他 Snap 包进行更新。\n\r\n但像你我这样的用户不能这样做，对吧？看到通知，立即关闭浏览器？并不是很方便。\n\r\n而当你有时间关闭浏览器时，Snap 刷新却不会马上更新浏览器。\n\r\n你可以看到更新的 Snap 版本的 Firefox 可用，但只要 Firefox 正在运行，它就不会自动安装。\n\r\n\n\r\n更新 Firefox Snap\n\r\n这是你摆脱每天不断出现的更新通知所需要做的事情。\n\r\n\r\n关闭 Firefox 浏览器\n\r\n手动运行 Snap 刷新（更新已安装的 Snap 包）\n\r\n\r\n确保你在 Firefox 浏览器中的工作已保存。现在，使用鼠标关闭所有 Firefox 浏览器或在终端中运行以下命令：\n\r\nsudo killall firefox\r\n\n\r\n现在 Firefox 不再运行，更新 Snap 软件包：\n\r\nsudo snap refresh\r\n\n\r\n你会看到它开始下载更新的 Firefox 包。\n\r\n\n\r\n更新完成后，你将看到 Firefox 已升级到更新版本的摘要信息。\n\r\n\n\r\n总结\n\r\n安装非 Snap 版本的 Firefox 也可能是个解决方案，但不是每个人都可以走这条路。\n\r\nFirefox 和 Snap 的开发人员必须齐心协力改进这个模棱两可的更新过程。他们应该提供更好的机制，不仅显示待处理更新的通知，还提供启动更新的选项。\n\r\n这是我们最近在 Ubuntu 上看到的许多奇怪的事情之一。这必须改变才能使 Ubuntu （再次）成为一个对初学者友好的发行版。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/pending-update-firefox-ubuntu/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "这个带有脚本的快速指南有助于清理旧的 Snap 软件包，并释放 Ubuntu 系统中的一些磁盘空间。\n\r\n\r\n我的 Ubuntu 测试系统中出现磁盘空间不足。因此，我通过 GNOME 的磁盘使用分析器进行调查，以找出哪个软件包正在消耗宝贵的 SSD 空间。除了通常的缓存和主目录，令我惊讶的是，我发现 Snap 和 Flatpak 消耗了大量的存储空间。\n\r\n\n\r\n我始终坚持一个规则：除非必要，否则不要使用 Snap 或 Flatpak。这主要是因为它们的安装大小和一些其他问题。我更喜欢原生 deb 和 rpm 包。多年来，我在这个测试系统中安装和移除了一些 Snap 包。\n\r\n问题出现在卸载后。Snap 在系统中保留了一些残留文件，而一般用户不知道。\n\r\n所以我打开了 Snap 文件夹 /var/lib/snapd/snaps，发现 Snap 会保留以前安装/卸载的软件包的旧版本。\n\r\n例如，在下图中，你可以看到 GNOME 3.28、3.34 和 Wine 这些都被删除了。但它们还在那里。这是因为 Snap 设计上在正确卸载后保留已卸载软件包的版本。\n\r\n\n\r\n或者，你可以在终端中使用：\n\r\nsnap list --all\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n对于保留的版本数量，默认值为 3。这意味着 Snap 会保留每个软件包的 3 个旧版本，包括当前安装版本。如果你对磁盘空间没有限制，这是可以的。\n\r\n但是对于服务器和其他场景，这很容易遇到成本问题，消耗你的磁盘空间。\n\r\n不过，你可以使用以下命令轻松修改计数。该值可以在 2 到 20 之间。\n\r\nsudo snap set system refresh.retain=2\r\n\n\r\n清理 Snap 版本\n\r\n在 SuperUser 的一篇文章中，Canonical 的前工程经理 Popey 提供了一个简单的脚本 可以清理旧的 Snap 版本并保留最新版本。\n\r\n这是我们将用来清理 Snap 的脚本。\n\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n #Removes old revisions of snaps\r\n #CLOSE ALL SNAPS BEFORE RUNNING THIS\r\n set -eu\r\n LANG=en_US.UTF-8 snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $3}' |\r\n     while read snapname revision; do\r\n         snap remove \"$snapname\" --revision=\"$revision\"\r\n     done\r\n\n\r\n将上述脚本以 .sh 格式保存在目录中（例如 clean_snap.sh），赋予其可执行权限并运行。\n\r\nchmod +x clean_snap.sh\r\n\n\r\n当我运行脚本时，它减少了很多磁盘空间。该脚本还将显示要删除的包的名称。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n结束语\n\r\n关于 Snap 的设计效率如何，人们总是争论不休。许多人说，它的设计是糟糕的，是臃肿的，且消耗系统资源。该论点的某些部分是正确的，我不会否认。如果正确实施和增强，沙盒应用的整个概念就很棒。我相信，与 Snap 相比，Flatpak 做得更好。\n\r\n也就是说，我希望这可以帮助你清理一些磁盘空间。尽管它只在 Ubuntu 中进行了测试，但它应该适用于所有支持 Snap 的 Linux 发行版。\n\r\n此外，请查看我们关于 如何清理 Ubuntu 的指南以及其他步骤。\n\r\n最后，如果你正在寻找清理 Flatpak 应用，请参阅 这个指南。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/clean-up-snap/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：校对者ID\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "基于 Slackware 的 Slax 版本在 Slackware 15.0 的基础上进行了升级，并带来一些基本的改进。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nSlax 是最有趣的 轻量级 Linux 发行版 之一。\n\r\n它是基于 Slackware 的，是 32 位系统的一个合适选择。如果你尚不知道，Slackware 是最古老的、活跃的 Linux 发行版，并在 6 年后见证了一次重大版本升级，即 Slackware 15 的发布。\n\r\n此外，Slax 还提供了一个基于 Debian 的替代版本，该版本正在积极维护。正如创作者在博文中提到的，这是由于基于 Slackware 的版本（Slax 14）在很长一段时间内（9 年）没有得到更新。\n\r\n因此，看到最终以 Slax 15.0 的形式发布了重大升级版本，以及也对其 Debian 版本（即 Slax 11.4.0）进行小幅更新，还是令人感动。\n\r\n有趣的是，这个版本早在 2022 年 7 月就向其支持者提供了。而现在，所有人都可以下载和试用了。\n\r\n让我来介绍一下新的变化。\n\r\nSlax 15.0 和 Slax 11.4 发布\n\r\n为了解决关键的升级问题，Slax 15.0 带来了 Slackware 15.0 中添加的改进。\n\r\n这应该包括增加了 Linux 内核 5.15 LTS，即增强的 NTFS 驱动支持，以及对英特尔/AMD 处理器的支持改进。你可以看看这个内核变体，提供了更多内置驱动程序，或者了解一下节省内存和启动时警告的通用选项。\n\r\n该个发布版本通过插件支持 slackpkg，这意味着你可以从各种软件库中安装软件，包括官方的 Slackware 仓库和 SlackOnly 仓库。\n\r\nSlax 15.0 还涉及到一个更新的关机程序，对设备的卸载处理更加完善。\n\r\n考虑到 Slax 不再是一个基于 KDE 的发行版。因此，当你下载 Slackware 或 Debian 版本的 ISO 时，你得到的是一个基于 Fluxbox 的版本。\n\r\n而对于 Debian 版本，你会发现它的更新是基于 Debian 11.4 “Bullseye” 的。\n\r\n下载 Slax 15.0 和 Slax 11.4\n\r\n你无法找到基于 Slackware 的版本的 32 位版本，而只能找到基于 Debian 的。\n\r\n其 ISO 文件可以在其官方网站上下载。如果你想以某种方式支持该项目，也可以选择购买。\n\r\n\r\nSlax 15.0\n\r\n\r\n无论哪种情况，你都可以前往其 Patreon 页面 以示支持。\n\r\n你对 Slax 15.0 的发布有什么看法？你试过了吗？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/slax-15-release/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "「记录」这件事就是非常有威力，它会把注意力之外的小细节收集起来，给予一种确实发生但又意料之外的生活视角。比如如果不是记账，我不知道原来每个月会支出那么多零零碎碎的「拿铁因子」；如果不是 HiWater，我也不会知道原来自己摄入那么多含糖饮料。\n其实我很早之前就购买过 WaterMinder 这款 App Store Editors's Choice 应用，只是彼时的我并不明白「多喝水」三个字对身体的意义，同时也觉得记录喝水这件事就像是记账——没有外部约束、「记录多少全凭诚实美德」的记录只在于自我娱乐。所以往往三天后意兴阑珊删除了事。\nHiWater 则是好友 @特伦 推荐的，把玩了下觉得还不错，但当时并不想为这个需求掏钱；不久前确诊痛风后，离开诊室满心灰暗的我有了「每天喝水 3L+」的刚需，这才发现这款应用的每一个付费点都值得我掏钱。\n作为一款国产应用，HiWater 的饮品目录预设种类都比较契合日常，并且在目录处还醒目地标注了每 100 毫升所带有的千卡热量。向下翻阅到高热量饮品时甚至有一种黑名单的既视感。\n\n如此设计的部分原因是，HiWater 采用了「饮水金字塔」模型，它将所有饮品归在六个等级内，并依此建议每日摄入的比例。此模型虽有哈佛大学公共卫生学院专家的背书，总体指导思想依然是鼓励大家多喝白水，减少摄入高糖、甚至是含糖饮料。\n关联阅读：如何合理控制糖分摄入\n\n对喝水提醒应用来说，我们一般会面临预设饮品难以覆盖真实世界情况的问题。\n所以在 HiWater 中我们也可以新增或编辑饮品类目到「饮水金字塔」模型中，把某个模糊的品类变成精确的单品。比如说 HiWater 预设了椰子水这个饮品，但我日常喝得比较多的是山姆椰子水，那我就直接编辑成山姆椰子水的营养成分，并重新归类到低卡饮料分类中去；再比如我喝的柠檬水是浓缩液和水 1:10 冲兑而来，因此我也通过计算将预设的「柠檬水」编辑成「自制柠檬水」，并由浓缩液计算出对应的热量。\n当然，手动编辑多了我们自然就会想：这些外包装上带有营养成分表的商品饮料，如何快捷记录到应用内？\nHiWater 的答案是「直接用相机扫」，请直接看这个动图：\n\n我猜测可能 Apple 在系统中给了 OCR 相关的 API，开发者就取来做这个功能了。这是我最喜欢的功能，实际使用起来识别比动图中要更迅速，识别率高且稳定。偶尔可能会有一些识别错误，比如把 ≥ 识别成 2，但我也能原谅。\n如此一来，在机场购买的农夫山泉力量帝柠檬水、屯了两箱的兰芳园低糖冻柠茶，都可以统统扫入我的饮品目录。记录时也可以根据自己的实际情况调整，比如冻柠茶虽是低糖，我还是会将它兑冰水或柠檬水喝，因此我的喝水记录里经常会出现 50 毫升的冻柠茶、紧接着出现 200 毫升的水或柠檬水。\n\n之前做手冲咖啡用的秤，现在大多被我用于称水喝，但后续我发现只要记住水倒在杯子上的花纹位置，不用秤也能大致知道这杯水的量。以名创优品的 580 毫升容积的可乐杯为例，杯内两道凹痕，分别可以粗略看作是 200/500 毫升的刻度。在公司喝水，可以考虑在工位启用大杯子装水，之前因为杯子小+次数少，上班时喝水太少。一周下来，确实每日喝水 3.3L 以上。\n\n其余的基础功能，诸如弹出提醒用户喝水、身体水分的简单预估、根据用户情况估算需要摄入的水量等，我就不一一展开了，WaterMinder 也有，我认为这些是一款「喝水类」App 都应该做的免费功能。其实我原先也是想通过快捷指令自己做一个提醒和记录每日喝水的应用，这不难，我甚至已经做好了 社死版快捷指令 定时运行，但体验过 HiWater 的一些交互后，我最后决定不折腾自己了。\n应用内还有不少花心思的交互和设计\nHiWater 多样的桌面小组件，还支出快捷录入饮品，打破了我对 iOS 小组件「能看不能用」的固有认知（我原先在 iOS 上并不使用任何 Widget，这一下就微上瘾了，顺带一口气添加了其余应用的小组件 xD）。\n精美的 Widget，支持快捷录入\nHiWater 采用免费下载+内购解锁的付费机制，如果你看完文章对它感兴趣，安装来把玩把玩也可以。如果想要为它付费的话，建议先确认自己有强烈的督促自己喝水的需求，然后订阅一个月试试——我直接买断是因为意识到「多喝水」这样的生活我可能要持续好几个月，甚至好几年，本身并不是很理性的消费习惯。\n如果一个应用能够帮助我长期维持某个健康习惯，我愿意给出「十刀买断，天大划算」的评价；如果没有，我也会用「三分钟热度三分钟收获」来安慰自己。\n> 下载 少数派 2.0 客户端、关注 少数派公众号，解锁全新阅读体验 📰\n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀",

          "description": "自《PasteNow for iOS 正式发布》后，已有三个月没有介绍 PasteNow 了。这三个月，PasteNow 也没有停止进化的脚步，分别迭代了 2.1、2.2 和 2.3 这几个版本，其中 2.3 于今天刚刚发布。本篇即是汇总一下过去三个月 PasteNow 的发展与变化。\n支持 Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴\n正如标题所说，2.3 版本带来了「Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴」的功能。这是 PasteNow 迄今为止非常重要的一个改进，不仅带来更加一致的体验，同时也大大提升效率。解决这个问题其实有点周折，我先简单地补充一下背景：\n\nWord 和 Pages，因为其固有机制的原因（也许是 Bug），它不支持剪贴板的多项目粘贴。也就说是，往剪贴板里写入多项内容，再在 Word 里操作粘贴，你会发现只有第一个内容粘贴了进去，但是如果同样在备忘录（或其他 App）里操作粘贴，是会出现多个内容的。\n\nPasteNow 的用户最早在去年7月就给我汇报了这个问题，当时我发现是 Word 和 Pages 的固有机制导致的问题后，决定暂时观察一段时间，因为也许 Word 在更新后会「修复」这个问题。\n但是等了很久，这个行为始终没有发生变化，看来确实是固有机制的限制了。正好最近又有用户汇报了相关问题，我换了一下思路，看看能不能从 PasteNow 这边做点什么的方式来解决这个问题。于是还真让我找到了一个办法。\n假如你是 Word、Pages 等的重度用户，经常需要粘贴内容至 Word、Pages 里，特别是一次性粘贴多项内容，现在通过 PasteNow 可以更好的做到这些了。请看视频！\n \n更加全面和完善的快捷键体验\n作为一个效率工具，能100%通过快捷键来达成各种操作一直是 PasteNow 重点优化的方向。在过去几个版本中，PasteNow 加强了以下两方面的快捷键体验：\n\n支持将 F1～F12 录制成快捷键了，这意味着可以用更加轻松的「单键」来达成 PasteNow 的各项操作；\n支持通过按下“@、%、$”等特殊符号也进入快速搜索模式；\n「添加标题」和「编辑文本」操作，也有了专属快捷键，分别是：Command + T 和 Command + E。\n\n相信通过以上快捷键的改进，使用 PasteNow 的过程将更加流畅。\niOS 版本的变化\n三个月前的主要事件是 iOS 版本的发布，过去三个月，iOS 版本发展的怎么样呢？这里不得不承认一个事实，这个版本并没有达到各种预期，无论是我作为开发者的预期，还是用户对它的预期。\n首先是我作为开发者的预期，目前 iOS 版本的用户非常少，日活跃用户最多时仅为 macOS 版本的 1/15。相当于 15 个 macOS 版本用户才对应 1 个 iOS 版本。这其实也是在我的预期中，但没想到会差这么多。\n另一方面是作为用户的预期，很多用户对这款 iOS 产品寄予了厚望，以为也可以像 macOS 版本一样做到后台记录剪贴板内容、实时同步剪贴板数据。但事实是这个从 iOS 的机制上就做不到，并且在即将发布的 iOS 16 里，对剪贴板的操作将会进一步变得更难。\n以上当然不是用户预期的问题，而是我在打造这款产品时没有准确的传达信息导致的，后续在 iOS 版本中，我将增加一个 FAQ 模块，让用户可以非常直观地了解到这个工具能做什么，不能做什么等等。\n当然，我依然会尽力去完善 iOS 版本的体验，使其与 macOS 的基本功能靠近，比如在 2.3 版本当中，图片类的数据，现在也可以通过长按保存至相册了。这个是会比较实用且基础的一个操作。\n小结\nPasteNow 从 1.0 发布到今天，不过一年又三个多月，它依然是一款年轻的产品，我会继续按照既定节奏去稳步迭代，不断完善它的体验与其他 App 的互操作能力。\n希望它继续给大家带来愉悦的效率之旅～\n附：少数派下载与购买链接。\n \n \n演示：PasteNow 2.3 多项目粘贴至 Word",

Twitter initially patched the issue in January after receiving a report through its bug bounty program, but a hacker managed to exploit the flaw before Twitter even knew about it. \nThe vulnerability, which stemmed from an update the platform made to its code in June 2021, went unnoticed until earlier this year. This gave hackers several months to exploit the flaw, although Twitter said it “had no evidence to suggest someone had taken advantage of the vulnerability” at the time of its discovery.\nLast...\nContinue reading…",

BigBox VR, the Meta-owned developer behind the game, shared the update in a post on its blog, noting that Quest 1 owners will no longer be able to launch or play the game starting October 31st, 2022.\nBigBox VR says the shutdown is necessary so it can focus on developing new experiences “that will push the boundaries of multiplayer VR.” Quest 1 players can still technically play the game if they have a VR-ready PC, however. The game supports cross-buy, which makes the PC version available via Air Link and Oculus Link. This should let users play P...\nContinue reading…",

The update comes only a few weeks ahead of Android 13’s expected release, and just a few days before Samsung’s Galaxy Unpacked event. Like the operating system it’s powered by, the One UI 5 beta looks like a relatively small update that adds some customization options, tweaks to notifications, as well as new accessibility and security settings.\nOne UI 5 builds off of Android 13’s theming options by offering up to 16 preset color themes based on your wallpaper and 12 additional color options for your home screen, icons, and quick panels. It also introduces a way to stack similarly-sized widgets on top of one another...\nContinue reading…",

We named the first prototype the “Preemptive report”.\nDespite the REALLY compelling name 😅 the first people who saw it responded with:\n “How come this doesn’t exist yet??” \nAt the same time, we realized that testing for problems with your data, model, and ML process, is relevant also much earlier in the research phase. The smiles on the faces of Data Scientists when running our package on a new batch of data, told us that this understanding is correct...\n\nAs we are a company of tech-savvy engineers, it was clear that the way to go for a dev-tool used during research, was to build it open source, and we started working on the package towards its planned release. After iterations with hundreds of Data Scientists from the amazing community (to which we owe many thanks 🙏) and receiving great feedback and suggestions (for usability, additional ideas for checks, requests for integrations with tools, and many more), we’re happy to announce the deepchecks testing package here on Product Hunt 🚀\n\nShow your support by giving us a star ⭐️ on github: https://www.github.com/deepchecks/deepchecks\n\nOur commitment is to keep this project open source, and to continue building a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, for “Continuous Validation” of ML pipelines, from research to production – for Tabular, CV, and NLP Data & Models.\n\nMore links to jump right in:\n- Get Started\n- Join Our Slack Community for more updates and info about ML validation and testing\n-  Open an Issue on Github for feature requests and feedback\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
