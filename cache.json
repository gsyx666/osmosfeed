Once a new model is migrated to the database and the library configured to use it, the UI is ready to manage the data without writing any code using a simple data table layout.\nHere is the required configuration for a model\nDYNAMIC_DATATB = {\n    # SLUG -> Import_PATH \n    'cities'  : \"app2.models.City\",\n}\n\nThe above snippet enables the Dynamic Data Table module for the City model defined in the app2 Django application.\nclass City(models.Model):     \nname    = models.CharField(max_length=100)    \ninfo    = models.CharField(max_length=100, default='')    \nvisited = models.CharField(max_length=100, default='false')\n\nUsing the model definition, the UI is automatically generated and presented to the users.\nMight be important to mention that all future updates on the model (add, remove fields) are reflected in the UI without writing code.\n\nThanks for reading!

The Time Complexity encompassing under it are O(N), O(N*logN(base2)) and O(N*root(N))\n\n\nN == 10^6 - The increment of a single power will bar the later one to keep only O(N) and O(N*logN(base2)) enclosed.\n\n\nN >= 10^9 - The one supportive complexity at this point is O(logN) with all the other failing at such an insurmountable number of operations. Binary Search much?.\n\n\nN == 10^3 - Apart from O(N), it extends its support to O(N^2) and O(N^2 * logN) solutions. This one is a Breath of fresh air to the beginners.\n\n\nN == 10^2 - The cubic computations are allowed in this special case. Going the brute force might not be a sign of concern in this case. You can opt for O(N), O(N^2), O(N^3) and O(N^3*logN) solutions beforehand. \n\n\nN <= 20 - Exponential complexity is accepted in this constraint with recursion and backtracking the goto approach for solving such problems.\n\n\n\nProblem Categorization\n\n1. 10^2 - Brute force/ Greedy\n2. 10^5 - Sorting/ Combinations on Binary Search \n3. 10^8 - HashMap/ Sliding Window/Two Pointer/Stack/Queue\n4. 10^10 - Binary Search\n5. 4-20 - Recursion/Backtracking\n\nAs obvious, all of them are going to support O(1) in case you are wizard enough at an interview.

With the popularity of microservices, containers have emerged as an excellent alternative to virtual machines for developing, testing and deploying applications in a lightweight environment. \nThere comes Docker, an open-source technology that uses Linux containers to virtualize apps and other software processes so they can run independently and more securely in another container as if they were separate computer programs on the same device.\nDocker packages …",

I wanted to know how Preact works under the hood and the similarities and differences between react and preact, so I decided to learn it. This series is my journey learning preact and my thoughts on it.\nI recommend signing up and creating a preact code in nexuscode.online to follow along.\nLike React, Preact uses virtual DOM. A Virtual DOM is a simple description of a tree structure using objects:\nlet vdom = {\n  type: 'p',         // a <p> element\n  props: {\n    class: 'big',    // with class=\"big\"\n    children: [\n      'Hello World!' // and the text \"Hello World!\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nPreact provides a way to construct these descriptions, which can then be comp…",

Dart is a new programming language meant for the server as well as the browser. Introduced by Google, the Dart SDK ships with its compiler – the Dart VM. The SDK also includes a utility -dart2js, a transpiler that generates JavaScript equivalent of a Dart Script. This tutorial provides a basic level understanding of the Dart programming language.\n// Variable  - You can assign int bool or string anything you like\n\nvar thisIsVariable = \"string\"\n\n// String - Both double Quotes and Single Quotes\n\nString thisIsString = \"\";\n\n// Integer Type\n\nint thisIsInteger = 0;\n\n// Float Type - we use double keyword as float\n\ndouble thisIsFloat = 380.04;\n\n/…",

Let's take a look at what each one does.\nThe kubelet is responsible for establishing and acting on the communication between the Control Plane and the node.\nThe container runtime is in charge of pulling the relevant image from the image registry, unpacking them, and running them on the node.\nBesides the two main components, we also get the kube-proxy which runs on each node. It's responsible for maintaining network rules on each node. It makes sure the communication between nodes and pods is as expected.\nThank you for reading my blog.

          "description": "GNOME 有了一个全新的文本编辑器，以取代旧的 Gedit 编辑器。\n\r\n虽然 GNOME 42 已经可以使用了它，但 Ubuntu 22.04 还依赖于 Gedit。\n\r\n这在 Ubuntu 22.10 中发生了变化。 GNOME 文本编辑器Text Editor 现在是默认程序，甚至没有安装 Gedit。\n\r\n\n\r\n虽然新编辑器足够好，但并不是每个人都喜欢它。如果你将 Gedit 与其他插件一起频繁使用，则尤其如此。\n\r\n如果你属于这类人，让我向你展示如何在 Ubuntu 上安装 Gedit。我还将分享如何将其设为默认文本编辑器。\n\r\n在 Ubuntu 上安装 Gedit\n\r\n这实际上是不费吹灰之力的。虽然默认未安装 Gedit，但它仍然可以在 Ubuntu 仓库中找到。\n\r\n所以，你所要做的就是使用 apt 命令来安装它：\n\r\nsudo apt install gedit\r\n\n\r\nGedit 也可以在软件中心中找到，但它是 Snap 包。如果你愿意，你可以安装它。\n\r\n\n\r\n安装 Gedit 插件（可选）\n\r\n默认情况下，Gedit 为你提供访问一些插件的选项。你可以从 “汉堡菜单->偏好Preference->插件Plugins” 启用或禁用插件。\n\r\n\n\r\n你可以在这里看到可用的插件。检查已安装或正在使用的插件。\n\r\n\n\r\n但是，你可以通过安装 gedit-plugins 元数据包将插件选择提升到一个新的水平。\n\r\nsudo apt install gedit-plugins\r\n\n\r\n这将使你可以访问其他插件，如书签、括号补全、Python 控制台等。\n\r\n\n\r\n提示：如果你发现 Gedit 因缺少底角而显得有些格格不入，你可以安装一个名为 Round Bottom Corner 的 GNOME 扩展。这将为包括 Gedit 在内的所有应用强制添加圆底角。\n\r\n使 Gedit 成为默认文本编辑器\n\r\n好了！你已经安装了 Gedit，但文本文件仍然在双击操作后使用 GNOME 文本编辑器打开。要使用 Gedit 打开文件，你需要右键单击，然后选择“打开方式open with”选项。\n\r\n如果你希望一直使用 Gedit 打开文本文件，你可以将其设置为默认程序。\n\r\n右键单击文本文件并选择“打开方式open with”选项。在此处选择 Gedit 并从底部启用“始终用于此文件类型Always use for this file type”选项。\n\r\n\n\r\n删除 Gedit\n\r\n觉得 Gedit 没达到预期么？这很少见，但我不会评判你。要从 Ubuntu 中删除 Gedit，请使用以下命令：\n\r\nsudo apt remove gedit\r\n\n\r\n你也可以尝试从软件中心卸载它。\n\r\n总结\n\r\nGNOME 文本编辑器是下一代从头开始创建的编辑器，它与新的 GNOME 完美融合。\n\r\n对于简单的文本编辑来说已经足够了。然而，Gedit 有一个插件生态系统，赋予它更多功能。\n\r\n对于那些将它广泛用于编码和其他事情的人来说，安装 Gedit 仍然是 Ubuntu 中的一个选项。\n\r\n那你呢？你会坚持使用默认的新文本编辑器还是回到旧的 Gedit？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/install-gedit-ubuntu/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux 中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "组织层面的自动化一直是一个难以实现的目标，但 Kubernetes 或许能够改变这一切。\n\r\n\r\n当我在 2002 年采用 Gentoo Linux 作为我的主要操作系统时，我开始了我的自动化之旅。二十年后，自动化还没有完成。当我与客户和合作伙伴会面时，他们分享了团队内部的自动化成果，但他们也描述了在组织层面实现类似成功所面临的挑战。\n\r\n大多数 IT 组织都能够端到端地提供虚拟机，从而将过去 4 周的交付周期缩短到仅 5 分钟。这种级别的自动化本身就是一个复杂的工作流程，需要网络（IP 地址管理、DNS、代理、网络区域等）、身份访问管理、虚拟机管理程序、存储、备份、更新操作系统、应用最新的配置文件、监控、安全和强化以及合规性基准测试，等等。哇，这么多！\n\r\n满足高速、可扩展和按需自动化的业务需求并不容易。例如，来看看经典的网上商店或提交纳税申报表的在线政府服务，其工作负载有明确的峰值需要面对。\n\r\n处理此类负载的一种常见方法是拥有一个超大的服务器集群，以供 IT 专业人员的特定团队使用，监控客户或公民的季节性涌入。每个人都希望及时部署整个栈。他们希望基础架构在混合云场景的上下文中运行工作负载，使用“构建-消耗-回收build-consume-trash”模型来优化成本，同时从无限弹性中受益。\n\r\n换句话说，每个人都想要乌托邦式的“云体验”。\n\r\n云真的能交付吗？\n\r\n尚有一线机会，这主要归功于 Kubernetes 的设计方式。Kubernetes 的指数级普及推动了创新，取代了管理平台和应用的标准传统做法。 Kubernetes 需要使用 “万物皆代码Everything-as-Code”（EaC）来定义从简单的计算节点到 TLS 证书的所有资源的期望状态。Kubernetes 强制使用三种主要的设计结构：\n\r\n\r\n一个标准接口，以减少内部和外部组件之间的整合问题\n\r\nAPI 优先及仅 API 的方法来标准化其所有组件的 CRUD（创建、读取、更新、删除）操作\n\r\n使用 YAML 作为通用语言，以简单易读的方式定义这些组件的所有所需状态\n\r\n\r\n这三个关键组成部分基本上是选择自动化平台的相同要求，至少如果你想让跨职能团队轻松采用是这样的。这也模糊了团队之间的职责分工，有助于提高跨越孤岛的协作，这是一件好事！\n\r\n事实上，采用 Kubernetes 的客户和合作伙伴正在加速进入超自动化状态。Kubernetes 有机地推动团队采用多种 DevOps 基础和实践，如：EaC、使用 Git 进行版本控制、同行评审、文档即代码Documentation as Code，并鼓励跨职能协作。这些实践有助于提高团队的自动化技能，并帮助团队在处理应用生命周期和基础架构的 GitOps 和 CI/CD 管道方面取得良好的开端。\n\r\n让自动化成为现实\n\r\n你没看错！网络商店或政府报告等复杂系统的整个栈可以用清晰、可理解、通用的术语定义，可以在任何本地或云提供商上执行。可以定义具有自定义指标的自动伸缩器以触发所需栈的即时部署，以解决季节性高峰期间客户或市民的涌入问题。当指标恢复正常，且云计算资源不再有存在的理由时，你将它们回收并恢复常规运营，而由一组核心资产在本地接管业务，直到下一次激增。\n\r\n鸡和蛋的悖论\n\r\n考虑到 Kubernetes 和云原生模式，自动化是必须的。但它提出了一个重要的问题：一个组织可以在解决自动化战略之前采用 Kubernetes 吗？\n\r\n似乎从 Kubernetes 开始可以激发更好的自动化，但这并不是一个一成不变的结论。工具不是对技能、实践和文化问题的解决方案。但是，设计良好的平台可以成为 IT 组织内学习、变革和跨职能协作的催化剂。\n\r\n开始使用 Kubernetes\n\r\n即使你觉得自己错过了自动化列车，也不要害怕从简单、不复杂的栈上开始使用 Kubernetes。当你 掌握了初始步骤，就可以拥抱这个出色的编排系统的简单性，并根据更复杂的需求进行迭代。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/10/kubernetes-solve-automation-challenges\n\r\n作者：Rom Adams 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "之前，我在《论文读不懂怎么办？》一文中，给你介绍了论文阅读遇到问题时的几个解决方法。尤其是介绍了你可以求助的免费资源和路径，它们包括但不限于：\n\n幻灯\n博客\n视频\n课程\n代码\n\n那篇文章，在知乎上获得了 2600 个赞（截止 2022 年 10 月）。我相信，对于很多同学，起到了帮助。\n\n只不过，环境和技术在变化，我们解决问题的方法和思路，也应该与时俱进。\n这不，因为有了大规模自然语言处理模型的加持，阅读论文时遇到不认识的名词，或者无法理解作者的简单解释时，我们有了一种新的对策。\n具体的方法，就是人工智能替你阅读后，把内容综合整理，结合上下文转换成简单清晰的语言，再反馈给你。\n这个想法，其实并不新鲜了。翻看近几年自然语言处理领域的论文，你能看见不少相关的研究。\n只不过，那些研究成果只存在论文中，或者是在某个实验室的电脑里面，普通人根本无法接触，更不要说利用了。\n这回可不一样，有人（ \\@amanjha__ and \\@functionofjade）居然真的就做了个产品出来。\n这个应用的名字，叫做 explainpaper ，非常直白吧？\n\n使用起来也特别方便。不用去菜单里面点选找寻。只要你把论文传上去，高亮某一个词语、短语或者段落，人工智能就会自动为你解读。\n\n不仅如此，你还可以就着 AI 反馈的结果，继续追问。\n这种应用演示不大适合图文。所以我干脆为你做了 一段演示视频，你可以先看看。\n \n \n看完之后，感受如何？\n反正不少小伙伴表示，很兴奋。\n\n这东西背后的技术是啥？当然还是咱们的老熟人 ------GPT-3.\n其实 GPT-3 这模型的特点，说穿了就是大。因为模型庞大，参数众多，所以从海量语料库里积攒的「认知」就多。注意我这里刻意回避了「知识」这个词儿。\n\n（资料来源：t.ly/cY1kn）\n从上图中，你不难看到，现在的文本和代码生成中，GPT-3 都占据了重要位置。\n我喜欢共享内容的原因之一，是视频发出后总可以获得观众进一步的反馈。不少的问题，都会激发我的思考。\n例如有小伙伴在视频后面提问，说这个东西能不能帮着理解中文论文啊？\n\n这是个很好的问题。毕竟很多国内人文社科研究生平时阅读的论文，更大比例是中文的。\n我一开始觉得这个问题问得有些太贪心了。对于一个外国人做的刚上线应用，你指望人家立即支持阅读中文，还能看懂中文的研究论文，不大现实吧？\n刚要回复，我突然想起来 上次在 Lex 上面的教训了。既然 explainpaper 的底层模型是 GPT-3 ，那它本来就该认得中文啊。\n为了确保回答准确，还是实际测试一下吧。我传了一篇自己的论文上去。\n\n中文划线高亮之后，AI 反馈的结果让我有些吃惊。\n尽管 explainpaper 并不能直接用中文来解释信息。但它可以立即识别出「知识管理」就是 knowledge management ，然后进一步解释下去。\n下面这段解释，就更有意思了。\n\n它先广泛解释「插件」是啥，然后结合本文的上下文，指出 Roam Toolkit 是一种插件，并且描述了它的功能。\n不仅如此，从下图可以看出，就连划线的时候字符之间出现了空格间隔，也依然能正常识别和解释。\n\n下面，我故意找了个文中没有进行详细解释的「概念网络」，结果是这样的。\n\n我能确定，这解释里面出现的「宠物」、「猫」、「狗」啥的，肯定没在本文正文出现过。\nEvernote 这一段，让我愣住了。\n\nExplainpaper 居然是准确识别了这张表格，并且把内容总结梳理，然后用英文输出了出来。\n上述的演示，是不是回答了读者的问题呢？我觉得算不上。从需求分析来看，人家看中文论文遇到术语不清楚，自然是需要中文的解释。你再弄成英文给我，这......\n可换个角度想想，这东西帮助外国人阅读中文论文，可是再好不过了。遇到中文专业词汇，随时可以获得准确的英文解释，而且阐述还贴合论文的上下文。外国人读中文论文，将减少很多障碍。这或许可以快速提升中文论文的影响力，妙啊！\n另外，目前 explainpaper 缺乏中文解释能力，也给国内的开发者提供了发展空间。希望早日看到更多 AI 实际应用上线，帮助国人理解中文论文。\n我期待你能自己尝试一下这款在线应用。至少在目前，它是免费的。而且因为上传的都是公开发表的论文，也不存在用户隐私泄漏问题。所以可以放心大胆地尝试 ------ 特别是对于最近要写文献综述的小伙伴来说。\n欢迎你把自己测试的结果和经验心得，分享在留言区。咱们一起交流讨论。\n祝论文阅读愉快！\n如果你觉得本文有用，请充电。\n如果本文可能对你的朋友有帮助，请转发给他们。\n欢迎关注我的专栏「科研利器」，以便及时收到后续的更新内容。\n \n \n延伸阅读\n如何高效入门 Logseq ？\n互联网上的时光机器\n如何高效学 Python？\nVOSviewer 中文视频教程\n【知识星球精选】刻意练习区的辅助线",

          "description": "近几年区块链逐渐火热以后，「去中心化」的概念逐渐受到关注。\n去中心化指的是：在一个分布有众多节点的系统中，每个节点都具有高度自治的特征。\n回想一下，你的各种私有资料都储存在哪里？\n文档都在 WPS 的云盘，或者散落在各种文件夹中；\n音频文件可能分散在网易云音乐、QQ 音乐、酷狗等等音频平台，如果你喜欢音乐的本地化，也许会下载到某个文件夹中；\n至于相片这种更为私人的东西，则有可能在手机本地相册或者选择百度网盘、iCloud 等等网络云盘中。\n我们经常会把同类的文件分散在各处，当我们想去寻找的时候却往往难以在一个确定的地方查询；又或者遭遇到了平台倒闭，难以取回储存在云空间中的珍贵资料。\n所以对于文件的「中心化」储存和管理，是一个值得尝试的文件管理形式。\n我认为其中有三个核心：集中管理、本地优先、在线引用\n将「中心化」概念运用到相册管理中\n比如图片的管理，拿我的个人相册举例。\n我们的手机每天都会有很多图片产生：屏幕截图、自拍、风景等等照片，但并非所有的照片都值得长期保存，所以要定期清理无关照片，备份重要的相片。\n\n我从大学时期就开始使用谷歌相册管理我的手机相片，这个堪称当下功能最强大的在线相册，会智能地自动备份相机拍下的所有照片、屏幕截图，甚至还有其他 APP 中保存的图片。同时也可以一键清理本地已备份的图片，节省手机空间。\n五年多过去了，我的谷歌相册中积攒了无数张相片，其中超过一半以上的图片都是无关的废片，混杂在各种较为重要的照片中，我花了很长时间都难以删除这些图片。\n于是我国庆期间我批量下载了所有的相片，大约 5w 张，其中绝大部分图片都是各种被自动备份的无关照片，经过大约三天的筛选，最终保留下了差不多 7000 多张照片。\n那么问题来了，如何让我的相册不再受到污染，能够自动备份到谷歌相册中，而且我希望能够保留一份相册在本地，在我删除本地照片的时候自动在云端也删除。\n我采取的…",

          "description": "灵动岛是今年iPhone的热点更新。我们在早期的时候，看到了很多针对灵动岛的玩法，比如在岛的周围养宠物、用灵动岛打游戏、适配灵动岛的挖孔壁纸等。\n但是，这些玩法从系统和功能层面，并没有用到真正的“灵动岛接口”。在苹果开发者文档中，灵动岛实际上是一种“实时活动”。在某些用户需要实时关注状态变化的场景下，为用户展示信息。比如实时更新比赛数据、实时更新外卖进度、实时更新计时器、实时更新地图导航指引等等。\n如果iPhone安装了iOS 16.1系统，在iPhone 14 Pro机型上，实时活动可以在灵动岛和锁屏界面展示；而在非iPhone 14 Pro机型，则只在锁屏界面展示。\n\nOneWidget如何定位灵动岛？\n仔细阅读苹果开发者文档之后，我们发现实时活动的实现方式和小组件有非常多重叠的地方。同时，不管在锁屏界面还是“展开的”灵动岛位置，它的尺寸都很像中尺寸的桌面小组件。再者，实时活动不能够交互、也不能有动画、不能随时刷新，这些和小组件都太像了。所以，我们最终把实时活动定位成“一种特殊的小组件”。\n当我们把“灵动岛”定义为“实时展示的小组件”，那么一切就更简单了，原则上小组件能够实现的它都可以实现。只是我们需要额外思考，在锁屏和灵动岛这两个特殊的位置，用户凭什么要展开来用它。\nOneWidget怎么做灵动岛功能？\n在迭代产品的2年多时间里，OneWidget的各种类型的小组件从用户那里得到了很多不错的回馈。当我们复盘这些小组件，用户最关心的是三个关键词：实用、美观、趣味。所以，设计灵动岛这个特殊的小组件，我们应该做的也是实用、美观、趣味。另外补充一点，对于很多用户来说，美观、趣味也是一种实用价值，美观带来个性化的装饰、趣味带来功能的尝鲜探索。\n从实用和便捷角度，我们设计了“启动之岛”和“健康之岛”。\n从美观和趣味角度，我们设计了“宠物之岛”和“摆烂之岛”。\n\n如何开启灵动岛？\n如果iPhone更新到iOS 16.1以上，下载OneWidget 的3.6.0以上的版本之后，可以进入个人中心找到主入口。在灵动岛配置页面，选择需要开启的“岛屿”，当App进入后台或者切换到其他App，实时活动就已经开启在了锁屏界面和灵动岛区域。\n配置入口我们还单独设计了一些细节：会动的海平面、开启后的彩色提示框、预览效果等。\n\n宠物之岛\n用户可以在“宠物之岛”领养一个自己的电子宠物，它每天陪你玩、会饿、会困、会渴，在不同的状态下用户需要点击不同的操作。我们给宠物取了一个名字叫做“岛岛”，领养之后，在App内还会显示领养的天数。岛岛除了不同的状态，也有可能会出去玩耍，只有等他回来才能再次跟他互动。为了满足个性化，宠物“岛岛”还允许自定义颜色，现在我们支持了7种颜色的切换。\n\n启动之岛\n“启动之岛”可以允许用户添加快速启动App或者小程序的入口，常驻在锁屏界面和灵动岛里，展开之后即可点击一键直达的App。用户可以添加1~6的常用启动入口，根据添加的数量变化，图标和间距会自动调整来适应合适的布局。和锁屏小组件、桌面小组件一行，这里的启动器入口支持添加常用的App、微信支付宝的二级路径、微信和支付宝的小程序入口。\n\n摆烂之岛\n“摆烂之岛”将随机展示一些“反鸡汤”的插画和文案。这个功能为了满足“趣味性”，该卷的时候卷，该躺的时候也要好好躺。偶尔摆烂无可厚非，休息是人之常情。\n\n健康之岛\n“健康之岛”实时展示用户当天的健康数据，比如步数、运动时间、消耗能量、身高、体重等。尤其是对于每日会更新变动的数据，是可以查看更新数据的（不过目前系统刷新问题，会有较多延迟）。\n\n \n以上就是OneWidget关于灵动岛功能的思考和功能的介绍。希望帮助大家了解灵动岛，也能够帮助大家通过这些小功能体验到灵动岛（实时活动）的用法。我们将继续做好一个“装修产品”，带来更多实用、美观、有趣的功能。\n回见。",

One way you might consume such information is by date. To view commits in a Git repository created on a specific date or range of dates, use the git log command with the options --since or --until, or both.\n\nMore on Git\nWhat is Git?\nGit cheat sheet\nMarkdown cheat sheet\nNew Git articles\nFirst, checkout the branch you want to inspect (for example, main):\n$ git checkout main\nNext, display the commits for the current date (today):\n$ git log --oneline --since=\"yesterday\"\nDisplay commits for the current date by a specific author only (for example, Agil):\n$ git log --oneline --since=\"yesterday\" --author=\"Agil\"\nYou can also display results for a range of dates. Display commits between any two dates (for example, 22 April 2022 and 24 April 2022):\n$ git log --oneline --since=\"2022-04-22\" --until=\"2022-04-24\"\nIn this example, the output displays all the commits between 22 April 2022 and 24 April 2022, which excludes the commits done on 22 April 2022. If you want to include the commits done on 22 April 2022, replace 2022-04-22 with 2022-04-21.\nRun the following command to display commits between any two dates by a specific author only (for example, Agil):\n$ git log --oneline --since=\"2022-04-22\" \\\n--until=\"2022-04-24\" --author=\"Agil\"\n\nReporting\nGit has many advantages, and one of them is the way it enables you to gather data about your project.

Twitter is currently planning to charge $19.99 for the new Twitter Blue subscription. Under the current plan, verified users would have 90 days to subscribe or lose their blue checkmark.

Yoel Roth, the platform’s head of safety and integrity, said on Twitter that the company’s taking action against an “organized effort” to spread hate speech on the platform.\nAccording to Roth, a “small number” of accounts posted a rash of tweets containing “slurs and other derogatory terms” over the past two days, with the goal of making users think Twitter’s policies surrounding content moderation have changed. Roth says that just 300 accounts sent out over 50,000 tweets using a “particular slur,” and that almost all of the accounts in question are inauthentic. \n\n\nOver the last 48 hours, we’ve seen a small number of accounts...\n\n  \nContinue reading…",
