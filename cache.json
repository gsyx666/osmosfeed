It has three divs representing each horizontal section of the flag. \nNow let's style them with CSS:…",

In fact, if you Google \"golang error handling\" you will find many other blogs with various takes on how to navigate errors in golang. Even though the topic has seen lots of conversation, there really has not been much progress.\nSo I will throw out yet another blog post on golang error handling.\nFirst thing I will propose, though controversial, is to throw out everything there is about golang errors. Do not use error. Do not use the \"errors\" package. Just throw it all away (it was probably just giving you anxiety anyway). error was more like a guideline anyway.\nNow that we have no error handling we are open to a new world of possibilities.

          "description": "NetBSD 改进了对 1985 年的计算机的支持\n\r\nBSD 发行版 NetBSD 刚刚释出了一个小更新版本 9.3，在一系列的对各种新硬件的支持之外，还改进了对 Commodore Amiga 的支持。这是 1985 年发布的一种 16 位计算机。甚至其开发商 Commodore 早在 1994 年就倒闭了，但 Amiga 仍然存在少数但狂热的爱好者。如果你能找到一台还能使用的 Amiga，那你就能在上面运行 2022 年的 NetBSD 了。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The News Trace\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这就是开源，只要你觉得好玩，你就可以做，而不用管是不是有商业价值，也不用那么一本正经。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n英特尔的 Clear Linux 采用 -O3 来构建其内核\n\r\n英特尔的 Clear Linux 滚动发行版以其积极的性能优化而闻名，但他们的内核构建一直采用默认的 -O2 优化，不过，上周他们切换到了用 -O3 来构建其内核。虽然上游内核已经放弃了专门的 -O3 选项，但更高的优化水平仍然可以通过编译器标志传递给内核，这就是 Clear Linux 正在做的。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然 Clear Linux 采用 -O3 优化提升了多少还不得而知，但对于 Clear Linux 这种要榨取最后一滴性能来炫耀英特尔的 CPU 的发行版来说，显然是有意义的。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n谷歌将停止为愚蠢的问题提供答案\n\r\n“特色片段”是向谷歌搜索提出的问题而直接回复的片段，长期以来一直是该公司人工智能战略的一个基石，同样的技术也用于其智能音箱和语音助手。谷歌试图改进其“特色片段”服务，以停止对愚蠢的问题提供简短的答案。这意味着诸如“史努比什么时候刺杀了林肯？”这样的问题不会得到答案，谷歌搜索曾经给出过回答“1865 年\" —— 日期正确，但刺客非常错误。谷歌对其系统进行了训练，以更好地检测这些虚假的问题。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：英国卫报\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：给傻问题做出回答，显然也是傻的，这又是愚弄 AI 的一种方式。\n\r\n\r\n回音\n\r\n\r\n据我的朋友 Wren 再次爆料，Linux 5.20 的倡议者昨日 再次发出倡议，这次得到了四位国人贡献者的支持。我觉得这是一件有趣而有爱的事情，Linux 本来就是 Just for Fun，为什么不支持呢？",

          "description": "www.rocketlane.com). \n\nLast year in June, we came to you with Rocketlane, a purpose-built customer onboarding platform made for CS, Onboarding, and Implementation teams to help them:\n ⏰ Shorten time-to-value\n💪 Hit project goals consistently\n🤩 Deliver a 5-star customer experience\n\nIn the last 13 months, we’ve shipped a ton of features including templates, automated status updates, and built-in time tracking, to name a few. Our clientele includes the likes of Mixmax, Mosaic, Chargebee, Yellow.ai, Delhivery, and parcelLab and we are now a leader in Client Onboarding on G2.\n\nAccording to a study by Mckinsey, 70% of digital transformation projects fail and poor resource management is one of top reasons. Rocketlane aims to fix that! We’re\nthrilled to announce the launch of Resource Management. The module helps leaders with staffing and planning, and gives them visibility into the team's workload which is critical for projects with longer implementation cycles.\n\nThe key areas that this module will help you with are:\n\n➕ Workload balancing: Manage your team’s workload in real time. Get a complete picture of everyone’s capacity at a glance, and easily drill down to know additional details.\n\n➕ Resource utilization: See actual vs. budgeted hours and the members allotted to the projects along with the time they are spending on each project.\n\n➕ Demand forecasting: The module intuitively computes the demand, helping teams forecast with accuracy.\n\n➕ Resource planning: Add resource placeholders to templates so next time you create a project all your staffing requirements are automatically accounted for.\n\nWe’ve a 14-day trial so give it a spin and share your feedback! Link to Rocketlane's resource management: https://rocketlane.com/resource-...\n\nWe’re also offering a free Customer Onboarding Audit for the PH community. Visit https://maturitymodel.rocketlane... and get custom insights to improve your customer onboarding methodology.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "https://lockrmail.com/product-re...), but I am most excited to share with you the first iteration of Digests!\n \n🎉 Introducing Digests 🎉\nAs productivity enthusiasts, we created lockrMail to give you more control over your inbox, but one key aspect was always missing - the WHEN. \n \nTo say receiving emails throughout the day is distracting is an understatement. If you’re like me, you’re constantly taking small breaks to check your inbox - interrupting your work productivity or even time with friends and family on the weekends. With lockrMail Digests, you can limit the volume of communications you receive by bundling similar Senders into a single digest. You can also control when that email is received, effectively optimizing delivery to fit your busy schedule.\n \n🔒About lockrMail 🔒\nlockrMail is a new email, but not a new inbox. When you sign-up for lockrMail, you create a public-facing email address that you can feel confident using across the web. lockrMail seamlessly forwards all communication to your current inbox.  You can decide if you want to allow or block a sender, add a filter, block an entire domain, and (now!) create a digest. \n\n🧹Reduce inbox clutter - pre-filter for relevant content. \n🚫 Preserve your privacy - never give out your personal email again.\n📧 Maintain your email routine - lockrMail seamlessly forwards all communication to any email client. \n \nlockrMail is a FREE product. While Digests is currently an early access feature, for this week only (in celebration  of our Product Hunt launch! 🚀) we are offering instant 🔥 access to Digests for all new Product Hunt users. Simply register with the link above and snag your preferred username while it's still available! \n \nFor any existing lockrMail users, you need only refer one friend to lockrMail and we’ll give you access to Digests as well. \n \nMy team and I so appreciate your support and look forward to your questions and feedback! 🙏\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
