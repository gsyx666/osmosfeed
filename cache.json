SQLite is the most widely deployed SQL database engine in the world. The source code for SQLite is in the public domain.\nSQLite is a relational database management system contained in a small (~350 KB) C programming library. In contrast to other database management systems, SQLite is not a separate process that is accessed from the client application, but an integral part of it.\nSQLite is ACID-compliant and implements most of the SQL standard, using a dynamically and weakly typed SQL syntax that does not guarantee the domain integrity.\nSQlite is commonly used to store data on Android, iOS, and Windows Phone apps since it has a simple implementation, easy to adapt, and quite fast.\nUnlike client-server database management systems, the SQLite engine has no standalone processes with which the application program communicates. Instead, the SQLite library is linked in and thus becomes an integral part of the application program.\nThe application program uses SQLite's functionality through simple function calls, which reduce latency in database access: function calls within a single process are more efficient than inter-process communication. SQLite stores the entire database as a single cross-platform file on a host machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  References\n\n\n\nSQLite Homepage\nSQLite Wikipedia Article\nOfficial SQLite FAQ\nSQLite Documentation\nSQLite In 5 Minutes Or Less\nSQLite4 Documentation\nSQLite4 LSM User Manual\nSQLite4 LSM API Reference\nThe advantages of an LSM vs a B-Tree\nGetting Started with SQL: A Hands-On Approach for Beginners\nThe Definitive Guide to SQLite 2nd Edition\nUsing SQLite\nIntroducing SQLite for Mobile Developers\nLearning SQLite for iOS\nAndroid SQLite Essentials",

          "description": "VLC 媒体播放器是 最好的媒体播放器 之一。这款跨平台播放器功能丰富，可以播放任何可用的媒体格式。\n\r\n你会惊讶地发现 VLC 不仅仅是一个视频播放器。它可以对你的媒体文件做很多事情。\n\r\n我们分享过 使用 VLC 下载 YouTube 视频 的 VLC 技巧。\n\r\n让我再和你分享一个。用 VLC 裁剪视频怎么样？这不是 裁剪视频 的最佳方式，但它可以作为一个选择使用。\n\r\n使用 VLC 裁剪视频\n\r\n在 VLC 中裁剪视频本质上意味着从所需部分的开头到结尾录制视频。默认情况下，录制控制工具通常在 VLC 面板中不可见。\n\r\n让我详细介绍一下步骤。\n\r\n步骤 1：启用高级控件\n\r\n要获取控件，你需要使其在主控制面板上可见。\n\r\n首先选择“视图View”选项，然后选中“高级控件Advanced Controls”复选框。现在，如截图所示，出现了带有几个按钮的新控件行。\n\r\n\n\r\n步骤 2：打开视频\n\r\n为了裁剪视频，你需要在 VLC 中打开它。你可以通过“媒体Media > 打开文件Open File”在 VLC 播放器中打开视频：\n\r\n\n\r\n或者你可以使用 Nautilus 文件管理器中的 VLC 打开视频文件：\n\r\n\n\r\n步骤 3：使用 VLC 的录制功能裁剪视频\n\r\n打开视频文件后，将时间线设置为所需输出的起点并暂停视频。之后，按“录制”按钮并播放视频。\n\r\n\n\r\n当达到所需输出的终点时，暂停视频并再次按下“录制”按钮停止录制。\n\r\n\n\r\n这应该将裁剪后的输出保存到你的 ~/Videos 目录中。\n\r\n\n\r\n故障排除：无法识别的输出文件\n\r\nVLC 以 .ts 文件格式录制视频。这在 VLC 中受支持，你可以根据需要使用它。但是 Ubuntu 中的许多其他播放器，包括本地视频播放器，都无法识别该格式。因此，在这种情况下，有两种解决方案。\n\r\nGnome-Video 提示安装 GStreamer 包\n\r\n当你尝试打开文件时，GNOME-Videos 会提示错误并建议安装 Gstreamer 多媒体编解码器。\n\r\n\n\r\n你可以点击上图所示的 “在 Ubuntu 软件应用中查找Find in Ubuntu Software” 按钮，这将打开 Ubuntu 软件中心。你可以在那里安装所需的编解码器包。\n\r\n\n\r\n同样安装 Gnome-videos 并使用它打开视频将解决问题。\n\r\n使用 VLC 转换视频文件\n\r\n如果你不想为此安装任何额外的软件包，你可以使用 VLC 本身将 .ts 文件转换为 mp4 格式以在任何其他播放器中播放。\n\r\n为此，打开 VLC 并在“媒体Media”菜单下选择“转换/保存Conver/Save”选项。\n\r\n\n\r\n现在，使用“添加Add”按钮提供需要转换的文件的位置，然后选择“转换/保存Conver/Save”，如截图所示。\n\r\n\n\r\n选择所需的输出配置（MP4）并为输出设置文件名，然后按“开始Start”。\n\r\n\n\r\n这将开始转换，并根据源的时长决定转换时间。完成后，你可以从 ~/Videos 目录访问转换后的输出。\n\r\n\n\r\n总结\n\r\n虽然确实可以使用 VLC 播放器来裁剪视频，但整个过程与专门的 视频编辑器 完全不同。\n\r\n最大的问题是你需要观看所有裁剪部分才能完成裁剪，如果你要裁剪跨越数分钟的视频的一大部分，这就不方便了。\n\r\n无论如何，这个很酷的功能在某些情况下可能是一个方便的工具，比如你想要的只是裁剪一个特定的小剪辑或从电影场景中制作一个 Gif。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/vlc-trim-video/\n\r\n作者：Sreenath 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "作为一名iPhone用户，快捷指令是系统中我觉得很有趣但实际上用得不是很多的应用。\n最初对快捷指令的理解仅限于将多个操作步骤简化成一个，最直观的应用就是在功能日益繁杂的APP中实现功能的一键直达，比如疫情期间的健康码。\n但深入探究一番后，我认为快捷指令的本质其实是打破各个APP沙盒的壁垒，实现不同应用程序的能力互通，提升个人的自动化水平。\n但事情情况并不尽如人意，虽然快捷指令编辑器提供了足够强大的编辑器，但三方应用对其支持并不好，大多数APP还是尽可能期望把用户圈在自己的生态中，没有开放足够的能力出来，这也是一款生态级应用的无奈。\n想象中的快捷指令\n现在应用商店的APP已经足够多，可以帮助人们解决足够多的问题，但有时候一款应用并不能完全解决某项任务，需要多个应用配合操作，如果用户可以随意调用应用中功能并组合成自己所需要完成特定任务的能力，那么用户体验和效率都将提升到新的高度。\n想象一种场景，当我在观看自己感兴趣的外语视频时，因为语言的障碍可能不能足够理解视频内容，我需要一些辅助支持：我希望翻译软件能够帮我把外语翻译成母语，甚至希望语音合成软件将翻译后的语言读出来。孤立地看这个场景中的每个需求，都有应用能很好得实现：视频网站能够提供我感兴趣的内容，翻译软件能将语言进行较高准确度的翻译，语音合成软件能够将文字朗读出来。但是当这三个需求点分布在三个不同的APP时，用户就难以较高效率完成这个场景的任务。实际上每个APP的能力都被封锁在了自己APP里面。\n\n上面说的这个场景我自己就有，但是因为没能使用现有工具很好使用，只得自己动手做了一个插件，可以朗读B站上面带有字幕的视频，因为微软的中文语音合成做得比较好，所以先放在Edge浏览器上了，目前还只支持带外挂字幕的视频，大家感兴趣也可以使用。\n\nB站视频字幕朗读（中文同传）插件地址-> Microsoft Edge Addons\n现实中的快捷指令\n虽然当前快捷指令还不够优秀，但对于日常效率的提升还是有一定帮助的，特别是对于实现与苹果自带应用的互通。\n举个使用的例子，每天早上我会用笔记软件记录一下昨日回顾、思考以及今日的计划，对于今日计划，我希望用待办应用去跟踪计划中事项的状态，但是手动把写过的东西在另一个APP里面再写一遍实在是太过愚蠢，于是我就写了快捷指令去实现。\n\n实际使用中，只要选择对应的文本并在共享表单中点击对应的操作就可以同步到系统自带的提醒事项中，在mac上还可以添加快捷键一键实现（应该还可以通过「自动化」省去手动操作这一步）。\n当前的快捷指令有三个亮点：\n\n在快捷指令的编辑上采用图形化拖拽操作，相对于写脚本，这种操作显得更加友好，并且也可以支持自定义脚本的加入，甚至让我一度觉得学编程的第一个应用是用快捷指令写得；\n在快捷指令的运行上打通了Siri、小组件以及共享操作，特别是后者，为与三方应用的结合提供了基础的平台；\n加入了自动化功能，可以根据一定的规则直接省去了用户主动调用快捷指令这一步。\n\n但要让更多的人在更多场景下使用快捷指令，还有着一些明显的不足：\n\n上手使用上有一些门槛，官方没有详细的教程，虽然提供了一些案例，但是大多数人应该没有耐心仔细去看快捷中心中那些精选的指令是如何实现的，这点Mac上快捷指令前辈「自动操作」可能给点其启示，其中「录制」功能可以通过「我做给你看」自动识别操作中的事件；\n快捷指令的分发做得还不够，既然不是每个人都能轻松使用快捷指令，那么获取现成的快捷指令则更加重要，但快捷指令中心中精选的指令本土化、个性化做得并不好，我觉得如果能根据用户所安装的APP来个性化分发常用的快捷指令会更友好；\n三方应用的能力开放明显不足，大多数的使用场景还是围绕在苹果自带应用提供的能力，这点极大限制了快捷指令的应用场景；\n使用Siri来激活快捷指令时对于指令的识别非常差，官方有说使用快捷指令的名称就可以通过Siri调用，但实际使用时不时语音识别不出来就是调用的指令不正确；\n\n有趣的是，在WWDC2022中，我们看到苹果开始推广App Intent框架，通过为应用开发者提供更多系统级的入口曝光来吸引他们将其应用所能满足的用户意图曝光给系统，从而使得系统可以通过学习用户行为实现跨应用的能力整合。\n结语\n很多人即使生活中充满重复的事情也不会去探索提高效率方式，因为对比眼前简单的操作，去探究增进效率操作的所花费的学习努力带来的成本更加高，只是把时间线拉得足够远，才能看见效率提升所带来收益。\n自动化所存在的意义是帮助人完成任务并节省时间，虽然我们每个人都已经拥有足够多的计算设备，但我们并没有充分发挥其拥有的算力，个人的自动化仍是一个尚待开发的领域。\n期待未来的快捷指令能为个人的自动化增添更多的可能性。",

Clauser) 和安东·泽林格 (Anton Zeilinger)，以表彰他们 「进行了纠缠光子的实验，确立了对贝尔不等式的不成立并开创了量子信息科学」。阿兰·阿斯佩克特、约翰·克劳瑟和安东·泽林格分别利用处于相互纠缠的量子态进行了突破性的实验。在这种情况下，两个粒子即使被分开也表现得如同一个整体。他们的成果为基于量子信息的新技术扫清了道路。\n—— 摘自诺贝尔物理学奖官方新闻稿\n\n说实话，在诺贝尔奖委员会正式宣布量子纠缠相关的成果获奖后，我立刻就意识到，互联网上很快就会充斥着各种针对量子纠缠以及量子世界的神秘性相关的科普。这些科普，无论是原创的还是东拼西凑的，无论是专家学者起草的还是各路内容流水线上生产的，都有一个共同的特征：它们往往都喜欢强化量子物理的神秘性和不可理解。\n我承认，历史上确实有这么一段时间，即使是 20 世纪初期那些鼎鼎大名的物理学家，都曾为量子相关的物理现象感到困惑。然而，经过一百多年的发展，量子物理的诸多核心概念早就被一代又一代的物理学家里里外外地玩了个遍，以至于许多被科普作家渲染得神乎其神的概念，现正躺在物理系本科生的必修课教材里。\n当然，量子力学有它反直觉的地方。但是，现实生活中反直觉的事情还少吗？反直觉并不意味着神秘或不可理解。它只是需要你屏蔽你的许多生活常识，用绝对的理性来思考问题。所以，这篇文章会和你读过的绝大部分科普不同，我不会把量子…",

Sometimes you get deep-fried in algorithms, tracking data, and ads catered especially for you. You lack administrative control over what you want to see, especially on the old platforms many of us are used to. As usual, you must look to open source to fix the problem. And that's exactly what Mastodon, an open source microblogging community, does.\nWith Mastodon social, not only are you working with open source software, but everything is decentralized, which means you can pick what you want to see partly based on the instance you want to occupy.

Tweets from educators and free and open source (FOSS) advocates worldwide kept me informed and engaged in a learning network that was without equal.

A \"window manager\" is a graphical interface that primarily (if not literally) just manages the drawing and arrangement of windows. In practice, even the most rudimentary of window managers actually provides a little more than just the ability to draw a window. Most also provide a pop-up menu so you can launch an application, some provide a dock or panel so you can switch between different applications you have running.

          "description": "https://library.gv.com/how-googl...).\n\nObjectives and Key Results (OKRs) are essential in structuring the modern team for success, and it is crucial to set high quality and meaningful OKRs to keep progress on the right track. In his book, John reveals how the goal-setting system of OKRs has helped tech giants from Intel to Google achieve explosive growth—and how it can help any organization thrive.\n\nFor many companies, especially smaller ones, a list of top priorities (Big Rocks) was enough to drive their planning process. But as teams grew, they naturally started forming a deeper list of commitments. In most cases, these had some relationship to the Big Rocks, but they were far more specific. Companies might only have 3-5 Big Rocks at a time, but have 100s of commitments. These commitments manifested in many ways — list of projects, spreadsheets of tasks, etc. But by far the most common framework we saw was the “OKR method.”\n\nThis Coda doc walks you through John’s OKR-setting system with the intention of integrating his best practices into your current planning processes. In this new version, we added high-level advice for teams, automatic reminders for stakeholders, and table columns to better organize your OKRs.\n\nWe’re happy to hear feedback on the template or just chat more about OKRs in general. Let us know what you think in the comments—and happy planning.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
