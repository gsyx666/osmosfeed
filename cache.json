I know you can relate. 😂\n\nI didn't quite understand the process, but the website was functional. I got my items delivered as scheduled. They looked nothing like what I paid for on the website. Yes, you are right! The no return, no refund policy. I couldn't return the items or get a refund. Moreso, replacing them would have been such a drag. I just had to keep them. 🤷🏽‍♂️\nI'm a junior backend engineer now, and I appreciate the thought…",

          "description": "在开始编写应用之前，为手机、物联网设备和边缘计算定义无线更新计划。\n\r\n\r\n过去对系统的更新相对简单。当开发人员需要修改他们已经分发给公众的东西时，会发布一个更新程序供人们运行。用户将运行更新程序，允许用新文件替换旧文件并添加新文件。然而，即使有了这些“相对简单”的更新，也有一个问题。当用户安装好的系统处于意外状态时会发生什么？升级中断时会发生什么？当各种设备都在线时，这些问题同样重要，有时需要重要的安全更新。今天的许多更新都是通过无线、空中下载技术over-the-air（OTA）的方式提供的，连接不良、信号突然丢失或断电的可能性可能会对应该是次要更新的内容造成灾难性的影响。这些是你在计划提供 OTA 更新时需要考虑的三大策略。\n\r\n1、验证\n\r\nTCP 协议内置了很多验证功能，因此当你 向设备发送数据包 时，通常可以确信每个数据包都已完好无损地收到。但是，TCP 无法报告它不知道的错误，因此由你来验证以下内容：\n\r\n\r\n你是否已发送更新所需的所有文件？设备无法接收没有发送的内容。\n\r\n收到的文件和你发送的文件一样吗？至少，检查 SHA 和以验证文件完整性。\n\r\n如果可能，请使用 数字签名 确保文件来自受信任的来源。\n\r\n在允许更新开始之前，你必须验证设备能够应用更新。在提交更新之前检查权限和电池状态，并确保你的更新过程覆盖任何意外的用户事件，例如计划的重新启动或休眠。\n\r\n最后，你必须验证声称已成功完成的更新是否已实际完成。在将更新正式标记为系统已完成之前，请检查目标设备上的文件位置和完整性。\n\r\n\r\n2、回退和故障状态\n\r\n更新的最坏情况是设备处于损坏状态，以至于它甚至不能继续被中止的更新。在这种情况下，更新程序文件存在于目标设备上，但该过程已被中断。这可能会使设备处于未知状态，其中一些文件已被更新版本替换，而其他文件尚未被替换。在最坏的情况下，已更新的文件与尚未更新的文件不兼容，因此设备无法按预期运行。\n\r\n有一些策略可以解决这个问题。初始更新步骤可能是安装专用于完成更新的特殊引导镜像或环境，并在系统上设置“标志”以确认更新正在进行中。这样可以确保即使设备在更新过程中突然断电，更新过程也会在下次启动时重新启动。仅在验证更新后才删除表示更新成功的标志。\n\r\n根据目标设备的安全策略和你要更新的内容，特殊的引导镜像可能不可行或不需要。不过，原理还是一样的。当启动后，更新必须建立一个环境，在这个环境中，待处理的更新是解决问题之前的唯一途径\n\r\n但是，在更新被授予启动权限之前，用户（如果有的话）应该能够延迟或忽略更新。\n\r\n3、附加更新\n\r\n在许多边缘和物联网设备中，目标设备的底层是不可变的。更新只会添加到系统的已知状态。 Fedora Silverblue 之类的项目正在证明这种模式可以在许多领域发挥作用，因此这种奢侈的做法可能会变得司空见惯。不过，在那之前，成功应用更新的一部分是了解你将要影响的环境。\n\r\n不过，你不需要不可变的核心来应用附加更新。你可以构建一个使用相同概念的系统，将更新作为添加库或包的一种方式，而无需修改旧版本。作为此类更新的最后一步，具有更新路径的可执行文件是你所做的唯一实际修订。\n\r\nOTA 更新\n\r\n世界越来越无线化。对于手机、物联网设备和 边缘计算，OTA 更新通常是唯一的选择。实施 OTA 更新策略需要仔细规划并仔细考虑不可能的情况。你最了解你的目标设备，因此请在开始编码之前规划好你的更新架构。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/9/plan-ota-updates-edge\n\r\n作者：Alan Smithee 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "起初，我从未感受到我妈对于衰老的恐惧。直到大概五六年前我家重新装修房子的时候，我妈坚持要在他们卧室的厕所里装一个马桶，后来问了原因才知道，她大概是觉得以后自己老了，万一腿脚不方便了，用马桶会轻松很多。从那一刻起，我才猛然发觉这种隐秘的恐惧。\n第七次全国人口普查的的数据显示，目前中国60岁及以上的人口数量已超2.6亿，这个人数占总人数的18.7%。这就意味着，有相当一部分老人正在经历着这种关于衰老的隐秘恐惧，还会有越来越多的人陷入这种关于衰老的恐惧。\n为了回应这些恐惧，很多人可能最先想到的是“适老化改造”。当然，适老化改造是一个相当大的问题域，本文目前所要探讨的仅仅是房屋的适老化改造，特别是对现有的城镇房屋进行一些“修补性”的适老化改造。\n为什么要进行房屋适老化改造？\n我们需要先回答一个问题：为什么我们要率先对“房屋”这样一个区域进行适老化改造呢？这个问题的答案有很多。\n首先是出于目前国内养老格局的考虑。国内养老事业呈现出一种所谓的“9073”的格局。也就是说，90%左右的老年人居家养老，大约7%的老年人需要依托社区进行养老，最后3%左右的老年人将入住养老院。这意味着大多数老人会在自己的家中度过大部分的晚年时光。这几乎是最适合老人，同时也是最经济的养老方式。\n其次是出于老人活动范围的考虑。随着年龄的增长，老人的社会活动范围会逐渐缩小，老人对于居住空间的依赖程度也会越来越高。这意味着，居住环境成为老人晚年生活最重要的空间载体，居住条件的好坏将会直接影响老人的生活质量。[1]\n再次是出于老年人人体工学的考虑。据老年人人体工学的研究，在衰老过程中人体的尺寸也会发生变化。医学研究资料显示：人在28-30岁时身高最高，35-40岁之后逐渐出现衰减，70岁时身高会比年轻时减少2.5%-3%。[2]这就意味着，随着居住者年龄的增长，房屋也应该发生一些改变。\n所以，出于上述的种种原因，除了大…",

          "description": "前些日子，我给你介绍了本地使用 Stable Diffusion 人工智能绘画工具的方法（如何在你的 M1/M2 Mac 本地运行 Stable Diffusion？）。不少小伙伴们反馈说玩儿得很开心。\n\n不过也有不开心的，因为手头儿没有 M1/M2 的 Mac 电脑。\n\n是不是因为设备限制，就只能眼巴巴看着别人体验新科技成果呢？\n当然不是。人工智能技术的普及化，已经是科技发展的潮流趋势了。我今天给你介绍一个不需要安装任何应用的体验方式。而且，更好的消息是，你都不用把自己的想法翻译成英文了，直接输入中文就行。\n这是个微信小程序，叫做「盗梦师」。开发者是西湖大学蓝振忠老师团队。\n我这里给你做个演示。\n今早我看到有人分享了一段视频，是喷气式背包的实验场景。很有意思。\n\n于是我就在朋友圈发了一番感慨：\n\n有了这玩意儿，上班堵车不是事儿了。\n\n感慨之后，觉得光用文字表达不够形象，刚好就可以用「盗梦师」画出来。\n于是我打开小程序，输入了这样一段话：\n\n一个背着喷气式背包的中年人在交通拥堵的马路上轻松自在飞行\n\n这里注意你可以选择绘画的类型。我选择的是「赛博朋克」，我觉得和主题很搭。\n\n然后是选择画家风格。我对赛博朋克艺术家不了解，于是设置成为「不限定」。\n\n下面还有一个选项，是画面的长宽比例。我觉得对于展示的画作来说， 16:9 感觉上比较好。\n好了，做了这些设定后，就可以直接画了。\n\n这里需要等上几秒钟即可，比本地 M1 Mac 运行起 Stable Diffusion 来快多了。画做好了，你感觉怎么样呢？\n\n有了这样的形象画面，朋友圈里的评论一下子就丰富了起来，例如：\n\n假发套得粘的紧一点\n\n以及：\n\n当姑娘们画好了妆，做好了头发，美美的在街上走着，然后突然被人用喷气背包的风吹乱的时候，你猜她们会不会捡石头把它打下来\n\n我觉得，这些担心，都不无道理，值得背包开发商们认真记录和讨论。\n如果你感兴趣的话，直接打开微信，搜索这个小程序试试看吧。上文图中也包含了二维码可以直达。目前阶段，每天有 5 次免费创作机会。然后每分享给一位好友，双方可以获得 20 次创作额度。\n当然，我也尝试了一些其他的图画，例如中国风的「雪中山寺古钟」。\n\n雪、山都齐全了，只是寺庙在哪里？找了半天没看到，哈哈。如果你玩儿过 Stable Diffusion ，应该知道很多时候你需要多画几张，从中选择更合适的图画。所以我准备等明天有了新的额度，再用同样的文本，多画几张对比看看。\n欢迎把你的尝试结果和经验心得分享到留言区，咱们一起交流讨论。\n祝人工智能绘画愉快！\n如果你觉得本文有用，请充电。\n如果本文可能对你的朋友有帮助，请转发给他们。\n欢迎关注我的专栏「科研利器」，以便及时收到后续的更新内容。\n  \n \n延伸阅读\n\n【知识星球精选】刻意练习区的辅助线\n“没有灵魂” 的 AI 文本生成，有啥用？\n可视化卡片笔记写作？我试了最近才开放的 Heptabase\n大块的写作时间？这个时代，它是奢侈品\n互联网上的时光机器",

          "description": "小众消息的冯大辉前两天推送了一篇很有意思的文章，大概是探讨一个B站视频对微信存储机制可能存在的误解。文中提出了一个实验方法，看到做了试验可能会有奖品，我眼睛一下放光，不如就趁此机会做几个试验，好好探讨一下微信在iOS上的文件存储机制，包括：\n\n转发文件是否会占用额外的存储空间？\n从同一人处多次接收同一份文件是否会占用额外的空间？\n从不同人处多次接收同一份文件是否会占用额外的空间？\n微信和WeChat在以上这些问题上是否存在差异？\n同一台手机上的不同微信账号接收的同一文件是否占用额外存储空间？\n\n试验的环境是iOS 14.8.1、iPhone 11、微信8.0.28。首先我们删除手机上的微信重新安装。登录一个WeChat小号（小号A）。此时微信占用的空间是少的可怜的752.2MB，其中数据占244.5MB。我提前准备好了一个Ubuntu的iso镜像（880MB）。将它发送给这个小号。下载后重启手机，可以看到，微信占用的空间变成了1.77GB，其中数据占1.26GB。多出来大约1GB的空间，可能是除了文件以外的缓存、其他需要的程序和资源文件。\n接收文件前后的微信\n接下来我们正式开始实验。我们讲接收到的文件转发给三个不同的小号。重启手机，可以看到，如冯大辉所料，微信所占用的存储空间并没有增加。依然是1.77GB（数据1.26GB)。微信显然做了最基本的文件存储去重。\n所占空间没有变化\n接下来，我从另一个微信号将刚刚发送的文件再次转发给小号三遍。当我点进新发送的文件时，看到需要接受文件，我有一种不详的预感。难道微信真会重新接收一遍文件？所幸，当我点击接收文件后，文件在一瞬间就接收完成了。显然，微信也伴有服务器端的去重，在服务器上的同一份文件，在本地并不会接收多次。重启手机也可以看到，微信占用的空间并无增加。\n看似要重新接收，实际所占空间没有明显变化\n按照这个逻辑，即使是不同的人转发给我的同一份文件，应该也不会需要重复下载，或是占用额外的空间。我试着用另外两个小号（小号B、小号C）将同一份文件转发给小号A。虽然也显示需要接收文件，但同刚才一样，一瞬间就完成了接收。再次重启手机，微信所占用的空间依旧没有变化。\n不过，刚才验证的情况中，虽然是多个账号转发给一个小号，但是微信很容易在服务器端追溯到，这些文件的源头是同一个。那假如各个账号是各自上传的同一份文件，微信在服务器端是否也有去重能力呢？为此，我在另一台小米手机上登录小号B与小号C，各自发送同一份文件给小号Ａ。发送文件的时间较长。这似乎足以让人判断出，微信大概没有类似百度网盘的文件去重判断。\n然而出人意料的是，小号A还是一瞬间就完成了文件的接收。重启手机后也可以看到，微信所占用的空间并没有明显增加（总计1.83GB，数据1.32GB）。这说明至少在服务器端，微信确实能够判断出一份文件是否曾经上传过。而缺少类似网盘的秒传功能，可能是微信本身没有相关功能，也可能是Android端微信需要优化。\n实际所占空间依然只有一份文件大小\n出于好奇，我又尝试从小号B发送一份内容相同，只有文件名不同的文件，看看微信的查重是否基于文件名，或是基于文件本身。经过等待漫长的发送，如我所料，接收只在一瞬间就完成了。由此可知，微信的文件去重基于内容，并不依赖名字。\n不同文件名也不会多占用空间\n上面测试的都是同一账号下的情况。那么，同一台手机上的不同账号间又是怎样呢？我尝试在刚刚登录小号A的手机上切换了一个微信账号B。可以看到，这次转发收到的相同文件，需要重新接收下载。重启手机也能看到微信的占用空间变为3.8G（数据3.29G）。不过在这一微信账号下，同一文件仍然只需要下载保存一份，再次收到就能秒存。同时利用这个微信账号简单试了一下，我发现以上WeChat的文件存储机制对微信也同样成立。\n实打实地需要下载，所占空间也倍增了\n到这里，我们可以基本得出结论，iOS的微信文件存储去重做得还是比较令人满意的。同一账号下的同一个文件，只要内容相同，就只会在本地留存一份。未来微信团队可以努力的方向是不同账号间的文件存储去重。\n另外值得一提的是，微信大概是真的有在代码层面实现去重，而非依赖APFS的CoW特性。因为即使只占一份空间，iPhone在统计容量时也会重复计算一个文件的多次拷贝。通过多次复制粘贴同一份文件，你能很容易地复现苹果的这个Bug：\n苹果什么时候出4T iPhone？\n在我原本的设想中，我写出这篇文章后，与其拿到那500元钱，我更想获得一个与Fenng交流的机会，说服他微信是一个糟糕的产品。但转念一下，即使我做到了，也并不能改变得了微信这个产品本身，以及我们必须使用它的环境。更何况再一看那篇文章，是要证明微信没有去重才能拿到那笔钱。是我审题不细了😀\n\n如果你觉得我的这篇文章不错，也欢迎你阅读我之前有关微信的两篇文章：虎头蛇尾的《微信戒断实验》与尝试减少微信占用空间的《微微微信怎么办》。",

          "description": "继 7 月的《PasteNow 2.3 发布：支持 Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴》后，PasteNow 2.4 又带来了一个非常实用的功能，即「将最近一个项目粘贴为纯文本 」。\n新特性：将最近一个项目粘贴为纯文本\n在 PasteNow 的使用场景当中，复制粘贴文本是其中最常见的一个场景，而其中又有一部分的需求是将富文本以纯文本的形式粘贴出来，或者换句话说就是：去除文本的格式。\nPasteNow 一直都有按需去除格式的功能，它可以按纯文本粘贴或原始格式（富文本）进行粘贴。不过这个过程会需要将 PasteNow 的界面唤起，并按下内置的快捷键来达到这个目标。如果需要多次处理较多的文本，处理起来就会相对比较慢了。\n于是在 2.4 版本中，针对这一场景，PasteNow 引入了一个新的快捷键，即「将最近一个项目粘贴为纯文本 」。通过设置成自己习惯的快捷键，然后就可以非常迅速地以统一的形式在任何 App 里完成文本的去格式粘贴，这个过程甚至不需要将 PasteNow 的界面呼出来！\n举个例子，比如要将一个网页富文本以纯文本形式粘贴至 Word，首先将「Option+Command+V」设置为快捷键后，接下去只需要这样操作：\n\n在 Safari 里按下 Command + C 复制一段网页文本；\n来到 Word，直接按下 Option+Command+V，那么这段网页文本就会以纯文本的形式粘贴至 Word 里面。\n\n请看视频演示：\n \n \n相信通过新增这个快捷键，PasteNow 可以又快又好地完成纯文本粘贴这一场景的需求。\nmacOS 版本及 iOS 版本的其他更新\n和以往版本一样，每个版本也会带来旧有功能的完善和修复，其他更新有：\n\n调整音效的音量大小，使与系统当前音量匹配；\n修复无法复制正在编辑的标题的问题；\n修复无法显示其他应用保存的 JPEG 格式图像的问题；\n修复 macOS 端修改列表名称后，没有同步至 iOS 端的问题；\n修复暗色模式下，在一些白色背景的剪贴板文本下无法显示标题和快捷键标识的问题。\n\n其中 iOS 版本最主要的变化是完善了对 iOS 16 的适配：\n\n修复了在 iOS 16 Beta 版本中，底部工具栏会布局错乱的问题；\n修复无法通过搜索标题找到对应项目的问题。\n\n小结\n目前 PasteNow 还有很多需求和功能有待去实现，我会继续保持节奏，将其不断完善下去。\n附：App Store 链接",

Football fans across Twitter complained that they were unable to log in or received an error message when trying to load the stream.\nFormer Deadspin reporter Timothy Burke said on Twitter the service started having issues at about 2PM ET, and all streams when dark after that. DirecTV acknowledged the issue in a tweet, and later shared an update at around 4PM ET saying that the games went back online, but that it would “continue to monitor” the streams. \nIt looks like subscribers continued to have problems after this. Many users said the Sunday Ticket app blacked out certain games even though they weren’t available locally.\n\"Today’s NFL Sunday Ticket games...\nContinue reading…",

As demonstrated in videos and complaints posted across the web, some users noticed that their camera shakes and even makes an awful grinding noise when opening the camera on a third-party app, like Instagram, Snapchat, or TikTok.\nApple YouTuber Luke Miani posted a video to Twitter showing how his iPhone 14 Pro Max camera vibrates when using Snapchat, making the photo completely blurry. You can also clearly hear a buzzing or rattling sound coming from the lens that really doesn’t sound good.\nSo uh, we’re having some issues with the 14 Pro Max camera pic.twitter.com/7HH1wLFjdF\n— Luke Miani (@LukeMiani) S...\n\n\n  \nContinue reading…",

Supply chain analyst Ross Young says on Twitter that he expects Apple to include the Dynamic Island — the notch successor that currently only comes on the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max — on all iPhone 15 models, not just the Pro variations (via MacRumors).\nIf true, this would make the Dynamic Island the standard across all new iPhones, allowing it to fully replace the notch that Apple first introduced with the iPhone X in 2017 (at least until Apple comes up with another design). Young also indicates that the base iPhone 15 still won’t come with an 120Hz LTPO display that enables the iPhone 14 Pro’s...\nContinue reading…",

          "description": "@yechezkel_rabinovich and the rest of our awesome team, we have created an APM that redefines cloud-native observability with the use of eBPF.\n\nNo engineer would question the importance of solid application monitoring in production. These tools help us sleep better at night, and solve that crazy sh*itstorm when it hits. And it always does.\n\nApplication monitoring solutions have taught us that we can have all the data we need to feel covered, all the time. Thing is, these solutions are so hard to integrate and they store so much data that they just can’t scale.\n\ngroundcover is here to disrupt the APM market and change the way these solutions work and operate.\n\nObservability should be a tool to help companies scale and thrive. We make it effortless and scalable for developers, so they can focus on what really matters - building world-changing products.\n\nWith groundcover you can instantly get:\n❇️ Logs from all across your cluster.\n❇️ Metrics with mind-blowing granularity such as API latency, error rate, and throughput.\n❇️ Traces from protocols like HTTP, gRPC, Redis, Kafka, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more.\n❇️ A map of all service dependencies.\n❇️ K8s infrastructure monitoring and tracking of K8s events.\n\nOh and we’re Prometheus-compatible, so if you’re working in Grafana we’re just a datasource away.\n\ngroundcover takes 1 minute to install on even the most heavy-duty K8s clusters.\n\nTry out our free-tier at www.groundcover.com; One day you’ll look back, and say that you were there when APM changed, for good.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
