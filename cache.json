This literally allows you to use your phone as a software development platform.\nOne of the advantages of automatically generating apps, is that you no longer need \"fat client\" complex apps to create apps. Visual Studio, VSCode, Rider IDE and PhpStorm becomes \"obsolete\" for these types of apps. Creating an app with Aista implies selecting properties using checkboxes, select dropdown lists, and high level UI components - Implying it's equally easy to use your phone to create your apps, as u…",

The same principles apply in the case of software to ensure that the software system is perfect. Testing is a lengthy process and there are many different procedures to do it. These steps ensure that each software or system component meets the expected performance standard set by industries or customers prior to bringing the product to market. These steps and processes also help identify flaws, gaps or missing requirements that are contrary to actual requirements. Testing is done manually or using automated tools.\nTesting is more than simply pressing buttons.

          "description": "微软发行的“最重”的软件重逾 18 公斤\n\r\n在互联网并不发达的时候，软件的分发主要依赖于软盘或者 CD，并且其中会附有详细的纸质文档，这些文档可以达到数千页，因此导致软件非常重。据微软披露，它至今发行的最大软件是 1992 年发行的 Microsoft C/C++ 编译器及 Windows SDK，重逾 18 公斤，该软件放在一个长度超过 60 厘米的盒子里。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：PCMag\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这软件果然“重量级”。不过现在的软件都没有了介质，你是否“拥有”一个软件有时候并不确定，比如说云软件、订阅软件。还真是怀念当年计算机爱好者们背着几盒软盘彼此交流的时候。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n谷歌开源识别各种加密产品漏洞的 Paranoid\n\r\nParanoid 项目可以检测任意加密产品，甚至包括那些源代码没有公开的系统生成的加密产品。它支持测试数字签名、通用伪随机数和公钥等多种类型的加密产品，可以识别由编程错误或使用弱专有随机数生成器引起的问题。谷歌使用 Paranoid 从证书透明度项目中检查了超过 70 亿个证书的加密产品，并发现了数千个受到严重和高严重性 RSA 公钥漏洞影响的项目。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：谷歌\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这让我想起来前两天现代汽车中使用硬编码的示例密钥进行加密的事情，要是经过了 Paranoid 的检查，想必不会出现这种低级错误了吧。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nUbuntu 22.10 禁用 GNOME 43 中的设备安全提示功能\n\r\nGNOME 43 中提供了一个“设备安全”提示功能，可以对是否启用了安全启动、TPM 等设备安全功能给出警告。正在开发中的 Ubuntu 22.10 会采用 GNOME 43，但开发者表示将先禁用这个“设备安全”提示功能。这是因为要获得最高的安全级别 3 需要英特尔 BootGuard、TPM 重建、IOMMU 保护、启动前 DMA 保护、英特尔 CET、暂停到闲置、加密内存等功能，而 Ubuntu 22.10 目前只能达到安全级别 1。甚至如果用户试图调整系统达到更高的安全性，也可能会破坏系统。因此，Ubuntu 可能会在以后才支持该功能。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然说过于理想化的安全设置可能不切实际，但是这些安全功能可以在现代的 Windows 上正常运行，而在 Ubuntu 上却无法很好的工作。这说明，虽然我们觉得 Windows 安全性不好，但是很可能实际上并非如此 —— 只是用的人多罢了。",

So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.\n\n3x3 可以轻松的记录日常的时间线，可以关联每日、周、月、年、甚至人生的待办或者标签，并且待办之间可以进行双向链接\n做3x3的想法就是，过了很多年之后，我还可以方便的找到当天做过有意义的事情\n然后可以将所有事情串联起来，比如我学习一样事情，阅读一本书，可以清晰的知道每个阶段的过程，甚至你可以制作你自己的10000小时计划\n3x3 的设计想法在 2018 年初，就有了，当时我还做了一个简单的网页，它…",

          "description": "在 WWDC22 上，Apple 发布 iOS 16 的时候，公布了一个功能叫实时活动，并向开发者开放 Live Activities API。\n\n那么什么实时活动呢？\n实时活动是一种新的交互式消息通知，用户可以在 iPhone 的锁屏界面看到事件的实时更新。比如球赛的比分、打车或订餐的订单状态、运动锻炼的实时数据等。这种消息通知形式允许开发者在实时活动期间更新单个交互式通知，而不是每次有状态更新时都发送新通知。通过减少发送的通知数量，同时使信息更易于访问。\nUber海外版团队设计的实时活动界面\nApple 在 iOS 16 开发者测试版 Beta 4 首次向开发者提供 ActivityKit 开发套件，首次在真机实装，随后在 Beta 6 和 Beta 7 并没有在真机实装实时活动功能。开发者目前只能在模拟器测试这项功能，或者降级回 Beta 4 或 Beta 5。Apple 在开发者网站也明确表示实时活动不会在首个 iOS16 正式版推出，而是在今年晚些时候的正式版突出。下图是模仿目前已有的原神安卓小组件、iOS 小组件做的实时活动版小组件。到了 8 月 16 日一大早用手机更新 Beta 6 之后，手机就不能运行和测试实时活动了，随后也看到其他开发者反馈实时活动在 Beta 6 版本没有实装。本文后面的截图只能在模拟器截取了，但模拟器不能更改壁纸，只有黑色背景。\nXcode真机调试报错ActivityKit没实装\n实时活动界面部分是小组件扩展，开发者使用 WidgetKit 功能和 SwiftUI 编写界面布局，ActivityKit 是处理配置、启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动是一种消息通知，是一种可以自定义界面布局和更新状态的消息通知。下图是普通类型的消息通知，或许以后能看到换了界面布局的降雨提醒。\n普通的消息通知类型\n实时活动要求和限制\n与小组件不同的是，小组件是通过时间线机制更新界面数据，实时活动是通过远程推送或 ActivityKit 从主应用程序来启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动无法访问网络或接收位置更新，下图网络请求图片失败。\n\nActivityKit 更新和远程推送通知更新的更新动态数据大小不能超过 4KB。\n实时活动界面不能包含可交互元素，例如按钮和 WebView。当用户点击实时活动界面，将会打开主应用程序。\n自定义实时活动的用户界面时，系统会忽略任何自定义动画，但可以使用系统自带的时间文本动画，当实时活动的动态内容发生变化时，系统会执行一些动画。文本视图通过模糊的内容过渡动画内容变化，系统为图像和 SF Symbols 符号动画内容过渡，根据内容或状态更改从用户界面添加或删除视图，视图会淡入淡出。\n系统自带的时间文本动画系统为图像内容变化作出的动画效果\n在开发者网站的描述中，如果实时活动的高度超过 160，系统可能会截断它。在实际测试中，实时活动界面最小高度为 64，最大高度可以达到 220。目前实时活动功能还不是正式的版本，有可能在之后的测试版本会有改变。\n\n当用户在 App 首次启动时，点击允许应用程序发送通知时，就代表允许 App 发送实时活动通知，不允许则不会收到实时活动的通知。之后在系统设置 - 对应的 App -实时活动，可以关闭/开启实时活动权限。\n实时活动权限位置\n实时活动有 4 种活动状态，分别是：等待中、正在进行、成功、失败\n实时活动在锁屏界面显示的时候，用户可以左划，点击清除按钮将其清除。用户没有清除的情况下，实时活动最多可以处于活动状态 8 小时，如果用户或应用程序尚未结束活动状态，系统会自动结束它。在此结束状态下，实时活动会在锁定屏幕上最多保留 4 个小时，最后系统会将其删除。\n\n目前实时活动功能还在测试状态，开发者们还在为他们的 App 设计和测试这一项功能，下图是收集几款目前在测试中的实时活动的例子。\n一些例子展示\n关于实时活动这一功能的一些设想。在这个功能正式上线后，除了官方和大部分媒体提到的比赛比分、运动训练状态、行程状态、订单状态等这些功能以外，我们或许还可以看到这些功能：某餐饮 App 提醒你周四中午吃啥；原神体力、宝钱、参量质变仪到点提示上线领取；购物平台推送提醒商品抢购即将开启、正在抢购还剩余 69 件并且在不断减少等之类的功能。\n\n以上就是关于实时活动这个功能的一些介绍和想法。之前的一篇锁屏天气的文章和视频会有评论说解锁在桌面小组件就能看到天气了啊，左划负一屏添加小组件就能看到天气了啊。不过对于我这种手机懒得解锁的用户来说，对于锁屏实时活动这个功能是非常期待的。大家对于实时活动这个系统特性及功能有什么想法和期待呢？",

          "description": "越来越受欢迎的白板工具\n最近几年市面上出现了很多白板工具应用，白板顾名思义就是在手机、平板、或者电脑上模拟现实生活中白板的应用。\n白板应用从产品设计的角度来讲及其简单，因为白板应用的的概念模型足够简单——就是一张白纸、或者办公室放着的一块白板。\n如果仅从概念模型上来看，白板应用似乎没啥可做的，你只需要写一个白板，然后做一个手写功能就可以了。\n那么为什么市面上还是有那么多的白板应用呢？以及决定一款白板应用好不好用，我们是不是有什么样的评价标准呢？\n对于这个问题，我想说的是，在保证使用体验的前提下，工具产品本身是没有好坏之分的，评判一款工具产品好不好其实没有意义，工具产品只能基于你的使用场景，评判适不适合。所以基于这个逻辑，我使用一个框架对市面上的白板应用进行了一个简单的分类。\n\n \n在纵向，我根据使用场景来进行划分，就是你使用白板更多的时候是个人使用，还是需要和别人协作？\n在横坐标上，我使用白板本身的功能性来进行划分，目前市面上的白板应用在功能性层面主要分为两类，第一类主打真实书写体验，无限书写区域，完全书写自由度，第二类则主打提供模块化的组件，弱化书写体验，强化沟通模版的白板应用。\n从这种分类方式可以发现，其实个人的更偏向于自由度高的，而协作的更偏向于模块化的，为什么呢？\n因为这和实际的工作场景是匹配的，个人使用白板，无论怎么发散书写，书写的信息的上下文都在个人脑中。但如果是协作场景的话，沟通的效率就变得至关重要，所以一些通用的，模块化的，标准化的沟通方法可以让所有对一个事情的认知都对齐，这种方法本质上是弱化了个人化的表达方式，用更标准的沟通方式来提升沟通效率。\n也许以上分类方法并不是一定合理，但就目前我自己用起来是OK的。\n在聊具体的白板应用之前我想，先聊一个问题。\n为什么白板这么好用？\n“我们在描述一个复杂的系统时会怎么做？许多人会使用带有圆圈和箭头的图标进行描述。”-…",

With cloud deployments of applications as microservices on Kubernetes and OpenShift growing, observability is getting a lot of attention. Many applications come with strict guarantees, such as service level agreements (SLA) for downtimes, latency, and throughput, so network-level observability is a highly imperative feature.

This gives you full access to the response body for HTML rewrites and page data transforms. \n\n💬 Unique workflow for QA and feedback: When you open a pull request, Netlify generates a deploy preview you can use both for QA and to gather feedback from your team. When stakeholders leave on-page feedback their comments sync directly to the place where your team works, like GitHub, GitLab, JIRA, Trello, or Linear. This even works for content generated by ISR and SSR! \n\nHere are some links to learn more:\n\n- A better runtime for Next.js: https://www.netlify.com/blog/nextjs-advanced-middleware-better-runtime-that-extends-nextjs/\n\n- Next.js on Netlify Docs: https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/next-js/overview/\n\n- Starter templates and resources: https://www.netlify.com/with/nextjs/\n\nTo sum it up: Netlify's new Next.js Runtime and Next.js Advanced Middleware give developers the power to achieve personalization use cases like localization or custom authentication in a way that requires less developer effort and delivers superior performance for end-users.\n\nThis is only the first release for Netlify's Next.js Runtime. Expect more to come in the future! \n\nWe’re so excited to share this moment with the Product Hunt community and would love to hear from you. What questions do you have? Could you imagine using Next.js Advanced Middleware for an upcoming project? What new features would you like to see from Netlify? \n\nThank you for checking this out and joining the conversation!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "@PengyiWang. We are very excited to launch this on Product Hunt today.\n\n🟢 What it is:\nThe Shopify Plus Calculator is a calculator that calculates the cost of moving your Shopify store to Shopify Plus. It’s primarily used by Shopify merchants who are already doing volume on their store, but are not sure if Plus makes sense for them yet.\n\n🔵 Why we built it:\nWorking with ecommerce companies over the past years, we've experienced the power of Shopify Plus. The paltform powers some of the most beloved brands. Shopify adds a ton of innovation to it, which remains unaccessible for non Plus merchants. The cost of upgrading can be hard to figure out (SaaS fee + transaction fees + feature gains). It's confusing for most merchants who are curious.\n\n🟣 How it works:\n1. Enter your store metrics: orders/month, AOV, current plan, transaction processor\n2. Choose monthly or yearly billing\n3. See the cost breakdown per plan\n4. The conclusion shows the gross and net cost of upgrading to Shopify Plus\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
