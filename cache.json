          "description": "Stable Diffusion 是一个“文本到图像”的人工智能模型。近日，Stable AI 公司向公众开放了它的预训练模型权重。当输入一个文字描述时，Stable Diffusion 可以生成 512×512 像素的图像，这些图像如相片般真实，反映了文字描述的场景。\n\r\n这个项目先是经历了早期的代码发布，而后又向研究界有限制地发布了模型权重，现在模型权重已经向公众开放。对于最新版本，任何人都可以在为普通消费者设计的硬件上下载和使用 Stable Diffusion。该模型不仅支持文本到图像的生成，而且还支持图像到图像的风格转换和放大。与之一同发布的还有 DreamStudio 测试版，这是一个用于该模型的 API 和 Web 用户界面。\n\r\nStable AI 公司表示：\n\r\n\r\n“Stable Diffusion 是一个文本到图像的模型，它将使数十亿人在几秒钟内创造出令人惊叹的艺术。它在速度和质量上的突破意味着它可以在消费者级的 GPU 上运行。这将允许研究人员和公众在一系列条件下运行它，并使图像生成普及化。我们期待着有围绕这个模型和其他模型的开放生态系统出现，以真正探索潜伏空间的边界。”\n\r\n\r\nLatent Diffusion 模型（LDM）是 Stable Diffusion 模型建立的一种图像生成方法。LDM 通过在潜伏表示空间latent representation space中迭代“去噪”输入来创建图像，然后将表示解码为完整的图像，这与其他著名的图像合成技术，如生成对抗网络（GAN）和 DALL-E 采用的自动回归方法不同。最近的 IEEE/CVF 计算机视觉和模式识别会议（CVPR）上有一篇关于 LDM 的论文，它是由慕尼黑路德维希-马克西米利安大学的机器视觉和学习研究小组创建的。今年早些时候，InfoQ 也报道的另一个基于扩散的图片生成 AI 是谷歌的 Imagen 模型。\n\r\nStable Diffusion 可以支持众多的操作。与 DALL-E 类似，它可以生成一个高质量的图像，并使其完全符合所需图像的文字描述。我们也可以使用一个直观的草图和所需图像的文字描述，从而创建一个看起来很真实的图像。类似的“图像到图像”的能力可以在 Meta AI 的 Make-A-Scene 模型中找到，该模型刚发布不久。\n\r\n一些人公开分享了 Stable Diffusion 创建的照片的例子，Stable AI 的首席开发人员 Katherine Crowson 也在 Twitter 上分享了许多照片。毫无疑问，基于人工智能的图片合成技术将对艺术家和艺术界产生影响，这令一些观察家感到担忧。值得注意的是，在 Stable Diffusion 发布的同一周，一幅由人工智能生成的作品在科罗拉多州博览会的艺术竞赛中获得了最高荣誉。\n\r\nStable Diffusion 的源代码可以在 GitHub 上查阅。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/09/image-generation-model-stable-diffusion-is-now-open-source/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：lkxed 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "如果你在笔记本电脑上使用 Ubuntu，你可能已经注意到当你合上盖子时系统处于挂起状态。\n\r\n这是预期的行为。它可以节省电池和你的工作。你掀开盖子，系统唤醒，你可以登录并继续工作。\n\r\n这一切听起来都不错，除非你使用多显示器设置。像我这样的一些人更喜欢关闭笔记本电脑，只使用外接显示器。\n\r\n但是，如果关闭笔记本电脑盖会挂起系统，那么会产生问题。\n\r\n让我告诉你如何改变这种行为。\n\r\n关闭笔记本电脑盖时不要挂起\n\r\n实际上，我注意到最近的 Ubuntu 版本在这个情况下更智能。当笔记本电脑连接到扩展坞并合上盖子时，它不会进入挂起模式。\n\r\n这是正常的预期行为，但由于 Ubuntu 某种神才知道的原因，它可能不会一直有效。\n\r\n好消息是你可以使用 GUI 和命令行强制更改此行为。\n\r\n让我分享这两种方法。\n\r\n方法 1：使用 GNOME 优化\n\r\n如果你使用的是默认的 GNOME 桌面，那么你很幸运。 在 Ubuntu 的软件中心安装 GNOME 优化（Tweaks）工具，或使用以下命令：\n\r\nsudo apt install gnome-tweaks\r\n\n\r\n安装后，启动优化应用。在侧边栏的常规General选项卡中，关闭“笔记本电脑盖合上时挂起Suspend when laptop lid is closed”按钮。\n\r\n\n\r\n这就好了。你不需要重启即可使更改生效。\n\r\n现在，让我们谈谈命令行方法。\n\r\n方法 2：更改登录配置（针对高级用户）\n\r\n如果你查看文件 /etc/systemd/logind.conf 的内容，你将看到三种不同类型的笔记本电脑合盖默认设置：\n\r\n\r\nHandleLidSwitch=suspend：当笔记本电脑使用电池供电时，合盖挂起\n\r\nHandleLidSwitchExternalPower=suspend：当笔记本电脑插入电源插座时，合盖挂起\n\r\nHandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore：当笔记本电脑连接到扩展坞时，合盖忽略\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n如你所见，如果合上盖子，笔记本电脑将挂起，无论它是否连接到电源。而连接扩展坞忽略合盖。\n\r\n如果需要，你可以根据自己的喜好将这些参数的值更改为其中之一：\n\r\n\r\nsuspend：合盖时挂起\n\r\nlock：合盖时锁定\n\r\nignore：什么都不做\n\r\npoweroff：关机\n\r\nhibernate：合盖时休眠\n\r\n\r\n如果你不希望你的系统在笔记本电脑盖合上时执行任何特殊操作，我建议你使用 ignore。\n\r\n你可以编辑 /etc/systemd/logind.conf 文件，或者在 /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d 目录中创建一个新文件，并取消注释上述设置并更改其值。如果此目录不存在，请创建此目录。\n\r\n我不会给你确切的命令。如果你熟悉命令行，你应该可以做到。如果你对命令行感到不习惯，请使用前面的 GUI 方法。\n\r\n我希望这可以帮助你。如果你有任何问题，请告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/laptop-lid-suspend-ubuntu/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "GNU 创始人 RMS 发布《GNU C 语言介绍及参考手册》\n\r\nRichard Stallman 最近一直致力于精心编写这本手册，它涵盖了在 GNU/Linux 系统和其他系统上与 GNU 编译器集合（GCC）一起使用的 C 语言。你可以把它作为一本参考手册，也可以从头开始按顺序阅读来学习 C 语言。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：GNU\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：在不少争议行为之外，RMS 还是安安静静的做些实务更让人尊敬。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n欧盟的人工智能法案可能对开源产生寒蝉效应\n\r\n2021 年，欧盟发布了《人工智能法案》草案以征求意见。据该草案，开源开发者必须遵守风险管理、数据治理、技术文件和透明度的准则，以及准确性和网络安全的标准。一些专家在一项新的研究中警告说，这可能会限制产生 GPT-3 等尖端人工智能工具的研究类型的发展。如果一家公司部署的开源人工智能系统导致了一些灾难性的结果，不难想象该公司可能会试图通过起诉他们建立产品的开源开发者来转移责任。这可能会进一步将控制人工智能未来的权力集中在大型技术公司。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Tech Crunch\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：开源开发就是“按原样”提供，既不应该承担额外的责任，也不能承担这些责任，否则个人开发者谁会去贡献，谁敢去贡献？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nPHP 8.2 发布了第一个候选版本\n\r\n在过去的几个月里，经过一系列的 alpha 和 beta 版本，PHP 8.2 的第一个候选版本出来了。PHP 8.2 RC1 带来了各种错误的修复，包括可能的崩溃修复，PHP CLI 的内置 Web 服务器也对处理静态资源进行了各种改进。更多发布细节请参考发布公告。在未来的几周内，预计至少还有五个候选版本，而 PHP 8.2.0 的 GA 版本预计在 11 月 24 日左右。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：PHP\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：曾经特别流行的 PHP ，感觉不香了。这消息都过去一周了，也没什么人在意。有点感慨，我曾经最熟悉的 Perl、PHP，似乎都渐渐成了老古董，我当时就该学习 C 和 Java。",

          "description": "历史长河的锚点\n近段期间《梦华录》热播，我在豆瓣上看到网友“黄小胖”吐槽说，“感觉《梦华录》的制作方确实不完全理解北宋官制。”比如顾千帆的父亲说“你十八岁中进士，要是好好干，现在也是个翰林学士了。”事实上翰林学士官职极高，30岁左右的顾千帆正常情况下距离翰林学士还有很远的距离。\n《梦华录》\n同样的，顾千帆“兴平军节度使，参知政事，知苏州事”的父亲，这个“知苏州事”并不一定主政苏州。顾千帆父亲的历史原型可能是丁谓，有一段时间官名为持节苏州诸军事，苏州刺史，这些都不是实际岗位，都是他实际官名平江军节度使的自然延伸。换言之，丁谓当时应该在南京工作，而不是苏州。\n这名网友后来也感叹说：“《梦华录》的编剧就和我们这些普通观众一样，没有明白北宋阶官的制度，望文生义，认为苏州刺史就是苏州的官员，皇城副使就是皇城司的领导。这也是难免的，感觉只有专业人才能弄明白。”这名网友曾经对北宋奇特的官制产生了兴趣，在豆瓣友邻的鼓励下断断续续读了一些科普书籍。那么问题来了，有哪些能打通两宋与当下，专业与科普的书籍呢？或许《在田野看见宋朝》就是其中一本。包伟民先生在本书引言中，就诚恳地认为学术研究应当“走出‘专业’的圈子，以使历史知识能够走近更多的读者”。\n《在田野看见宋朝》，包伟民等著，浙江古籍出版社2022年8月出版。图源：浙江古籍出版社微信公众号\n就我个人而言，这本书之所以吸引我，在于提供了历史长河的锚点。这锚点，可以是距离我家不远的忠亭，可以是我多次穿越而过的鼓楼，可以是陆游的“深巷明朝卖杏花”，也可以是王安石在鄞县（今宁波）的新政实验。刘成国先生评价王安石时说：“所谓参天之木，必有其根；怀山之水，必有其源。”今天杭州背后的江南韵味、世代匠心，很大程度上来自两宋，而我们借助“锚点”回望两宋，也自有一股独特趣味。\n一手材料\n知乎上有网友提问说普通的中文系学生是否有阅读繁体竖排本古籍的必要。有一名网友…",

          "description": "这个周末又被封在家里了，去不了咖啡厅工作，客厅里唯一的办公位被麦嫂占领，两个孩子也很无聊，跑老跑去不得消停。于是，我也选择躺平了，一天睡两觉，醒了就刷视频、看电影。但偶尔又会想起公司的事；疫情各地物流受阻，电商收入又要受到影响；定好的品牌视频拍摄，可能又要因为疫情而延期；想着想着，心中又开始焦虑了，就这样在躺平、焦虑，焦虑、躺平之间反反复复，心情更差了。\n其实回头想想，在整个创业过程中，这点焦虑都属于家常便饭，但大部分人可能会困在焦虑之中，难以自拔。今天就聊聊我曾经最焦虑的几个阶段，也许能给大家一点参考吧。\n2015 年，为了公司业务转型，我开始尝试寻找投资人。性格内向且缺乏经验的我，除了要面对外部的各种质疑，还有应对内部的复杂关系，老股东该如何安顿？合伙人该怎样分配？每一次谈话，每一次邮件发出之后，都会让我无比焦虑。那段时间，我经常无意识的在街上暴走，或者去海边呐喊宣泄，情绪一直处于过山车状态，非常抑郁。直到融资搞定之后，我安排的第一件事是去医院做了全面体检，特别担心身体会出现大问题。\n焦虑归焦虑，真正解决问题的方法，还是要不停的尝试，通过理性沟通处理各方的诉求，该留的留，该走的走。突破自己原有的圈层，放开性格包袱，去寻找更多的可能性。所以，最终的融资不是来自投资公司，而是来自客户、同行和用户。\n2017 年，迎来了又一次创业考验，好不容易融到的一点钱，很快就花完了，马上就要进入发不出工资的窘境。现在想想其实也怪自己，拿到投资的一年时间里，过度的沉醉于资本市场逻辑当中，把大部分精力放在 BP 故事里，忽略了公司管理和业务聚焦，且一度自我感觉良好。\n此刻摆在眼前只有两条路：要么想尽一切办法支撑下去，要么选择清算并关闭公司。但这两条路都很难。不能再指望外人援助，靠自己就只能抵押房子，一旦失败，全家归零。想想已经积累数年的内容、用户、品牌，如果选择结束，也很难再有这样的机会了。何况我们确实做着正确且有价值的事情，只是我们还没有掌握更好的商业模式。\n一边筹措资金，一边送走部分团队，一边重新走出去约见客户。让客户了解我们的内在价值，哪怕是很小的客户，哪怕没有预算也无所谓，做好服务，以真诚换真诚。因为有前面的积累，加上团队的努力，半年之后，公司就能自己运转了。\n2020 年，公司业务已经稳定了，且略有盈余，我也终于还完了大部分贷款，总算可以轻装上阵。没想到春节刚过，新冠疫情全面爆发，全体成员隔离在家。刚刚起步的电商业务，直接就休克，客户拜访计划也全都暂停。说内心不慌是不可能的，焦虑情绪也开始了，但天灾面前，似乎也没什么办法。\n既然公司业务上没办法，就做点力所能及的事吧。无意间在工作群里发现了疫况小程序，可以通过地图定位周边疫情风险，我仔细研究发现是之前认识的开发者做的，聊天一问才知道，他也正在发愁中，数据录入、服务器压力，马上就撑不住了。于是我立刻动员了产品开发团队，参与到这个小程序的支持中，重构界面、扩容服务器、招募数据志愿者、紧急制作疫情科普防护内容，每天熬十几个小时，连续一周，竟然把这个小服务提供给三千万人。\n这段时间的无偿投入，虽然没有多少商业收益，却让更多人知道了少数派的存在，展现了团队的价值观，也间接验证了优质内容的多重价值。\n经过这些事情之后，我个人的抗焦虑能力算是大幅提升，并且也建立了应对原则。人非圣贤，孰能无虑，适当的放低预期，知足常乐。另一方面，既然焦虑不可避免，就不要轻易放弃思考和行动。要知道宏观环境下，很多问题都是阶段性和周期性的，它总会过去或者从头再来，但你的人生经历只有一次，你的行动将决定自己未来的走向。不管有多焦虑，都应该先选择承担起当下的责任，因为转机就发生在这个过程之中。\n换个角度来看，这世界上还有很多人，正在面对着各种生存、病痛、离别、各种不可逆转的人生变故，他们可能都还没有焦虑的机会，相对来说，我们依然属于幸运的多数派了。",

Today, it's easily possible for a single photo to be 5 MB. Accordingly, the maximum attachment size has increased to, say, 25 MB. But of course file sizes are getting bigger and bigger too, and so eventually the attachment limit will go up too. It's an endless cycle, common in the digital world: the tools are built for today's data, and today's data increases in complexity and size until the tools are revised and improved.

That means your phone can be provisioned remotely — no more going to a store to get a physical SIM. This makes it easier (in some ways) to switch networks or try one out — T-Mobile now uses eSIMs to let people test-drive its network for up to three months.
