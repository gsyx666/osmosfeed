Initially, we set out to make this happen using technologies we were already familiar with, AWS Lambda and Java. But to spice things up, we decided to add some new technologies to the mix — GraalVM to eliminate the JVM Lambda cold start problem, and DataStax Astra DB as our serverless DBaaS.\nSo, we spent a couple of hours per week on building a serverless order processing API using Astra DB and AWS. Due to the pandemic, you could call it a distributed “hackathon” of sorts, in which we had three main challenges:\nAccess Astra DB from within AWS Lambda\nWrite automatic tests for our Astra DB client\nSet up the Lambda function to use the GraalVM native image runtime\nI…",

          "description": "在 GNOME 桌面中创建自定义浅色和深色壁纸的简单指南。\n\r\n\r\nGNOME 42 将期待已久的浅色和深色主题引入了 GNOME 桌面。它还带来了浅色和深色版壁纸，当你在浅色和深色主题之间切换时，它会自动改变。\n\r\n因此，默认情况下，GNOME 会为你提供几组预配置的浅色和深色壁纸。\n\r\n但是，如果你想要在主题更改时可以自动更改的别的壁纸怎么办？\n\r\n以下是在 GNOME 中为浅色和深色主题配置和创建自定义壁纸的方法。\n\r\n如何为 GNOME 创建自定义浅色和深色壁纸\n\r\n首先，确保有两个版本的壁纸。通常，它们应该是标准的 PNG 或 JPG 图像。例如，我们在演示中使用了以下两个壁纸。\n\r\n\n\r\n但是，如果你没有合适的浅色和深色壁纸，或正在寻找更多壁纸，在本指南的末尾，我会告诉你如何获取它们或准备你自己的。\n\r\n跟着我来。\n\r\n其次，我们需要为自己创建一个模式文件。壁纸的自动更换由名为 adwaita.xml 的 XML 文件处理，该文件定义了特定的浅色和深色背景标签。因此，我们将为壁纸创建 XML 文件。\n\r\n为此，从 GitLab 复制 adwaita.xml 的内容并创建一个新的 XML 文件（链接在下面）。你应该在这个文件中看到两个标签：filename 和 filename-dark。这两个 XML 标记包含两个壁纸的完全限定路径。在这两个标签下添加图片的路径，如下所示。\n\r\n\r\n从这里下载 XML 文件 (adwaita.xml.in)\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n第三步，使用你想要的任何名称将此文件保存到 /home/YOUR_NAME/.local/share/gnome-background-properties（请将 YOUR_NAME 替换为你的用户名）。如果 gnome-background-properties 不存在，请创建它们。对此示例，我使用了 my_cool_backgrounds.xml。\n\r\n\n\r\n都准备好了。最后，打开设置并转到外观选项卡，你应该会看到选项中出现新的壁纸。\n\r\n选择你的自定义浅色和深色壁纸并享受。\n\r\n\n\r\n如何下载或制作你的动态壁纸\n\r\n你一定会想，“谁有时间去寻找和创建深浅版本的壁纸”？一些网站为你提供现成的动态壁纸，你可以轻松下载和安装。\n\r\n我推荐的一个网站是 dynamicwallpaper.club，它为 macOS 提供了一些高达 6K 的优秀高质量壁纸。你可以轻松下载它们。\n\r\n此外，如果你打算从上述网站下载，请记住该网站的图像是 heic 格式，因为该网站适用于 macOS。高效视频编码（HEIC）是 Apple 的 HEIF（高效图像文件格式）的专有版本。\n\r\n你需要一个驱动来查看和转换 Ubuntu 或 Fedora Linux 中的动态 heic 图像。那么，如何将它们转换为适用于 Linux 系统呢？打开终端并运行以下命令来安装驱动。\n\r\nUbuntu 用户：\n\r\nsudo apt install heif-gdk-pixbuf\r\n\n\r\nFedora 用户：\n\r\nsudo dnf install libheif\r\n\n\r\n仅适用于带有 KDE Plasma 的 Fedora/Ubuntu（没有此插件，Plasma 应用无法打开 heic 图像）：\n\r\nsudo apt install qt-heif-image-plugin\r\nsudo dnf install qt-heif-image-plugin\r\n\n\r\n最后，使用你喜欢的图像查看器打开 heic 图像并将其保存为 JPG/PNG。\n\r\n\n\r\n最后，别忘了在下面的评论部分告诉我你是否可以为 GNOME 创建自定义深色和浅色壁纸。\n\r\n干杯。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/custom-light-dark-wallpaper-gnome/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

The old SystemV startup shell scripts, of which the interface configuration files were a part, were incapable of handling WiFi, wired, VPNs, broadband modems, and more—or at least incapable of doing it quickly or efficiently.\nIn a series of articles, I've written about why I'm a fan of NetworkManager and how I've used it. In part 1, I looked at what NetworkManager does and some of the tools it provides for viewing network connections and devices.

They are overloaded with regular tasks and frequently called upon to solve urgent customer issues. Yet many developers, like me, have ideas they want to promote if only they had time to do so.

Other times, a developer does not have time to complete the solution end-to-end on their own, yet they know if it could somehow be implemented, the project would benefit.\nThis is where mentoring comes in.

The company is yet to announce pricing or a release date for the monitor, but plans to show it off at IFA in Berlin next month.\nHaving a higher refresh rate means a display appears smoother and less juddery, and video games feel more responsive to play — especially when combined with OLED’s near-instantaneous response times.

It guides you through a simple workflow to brainstorm, define, progress, review and accomplish your goals. It’s set up as an iterative system to get better at getting better. \n\nWhat’s included?\n\n- Resources and guides on goal-setting based on work of various authors such as Stephen Covey, Bill Burnett & Dave Evans, Naval Ravikant and Chris Bailey\n- A clean dashboard for your goals which you can orient your existing goal management systems around\n- Checklists and templates that guide you through the processes of setting and checking in with your goals.\n\nWhy did I make it?\n\nIt was the scratch-your-own-itch-factor. Well, more than just my own itch. Whenever I ask my team and friends what they struggle with the most it's unanimously goal setting. Wat goals should I set? How do I define good goals? How do I stay on track? As COO and Product Manager at our 40-employee business I landed on OKRs as the goal-setting framework of preference. So, After having tried and tested the system for the past years it felt like the right thing to launch as my first indie-project. \n\nI’ve been eager to start with independent projects for a while now. As ferocious Product Hunt follower it’s incredibly exciting to be on the launching-end for the first time. I’m grateful for my colleagues and online-friends who’ve encouraged me to take this step. And, a massive shout out to the Product Hunt community for nurturing such a great launch pad.\n\nIn celebration of the launch all Product Hunters get 50% off with code: ph50 \n\n\nI’m excited to see your feedback and happy to answer any questions you might have!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

My goal was to create simple tools that are private, local, customizable, and easy to use, without all the annoying junk like massive ads, popups, invasive tracking, or forced social media integration.\n\n\n👾 CSS @Keyframe Animation Editor\nA tool that gives you a timeline (like movie editing software) to easily create and preview CSS animations. \n\n❐  Box-Shadow generator\nSimply move some sliders to adjust your shadow, add multiple layers, then get the CSS.\n\n🎨 Colors\nCreate & convert colors, create color palettes, view color contrast and colorblindness, create gradients, and share your palettes.\n\n⌨️ Character codes\nSearch for and easily copy special character CSS and HTML values.\n\n👋 What makes it stand out:\n• It's free - all features. \n• It's private & local - Keyframes only uses Local Storage, and there are no 3rd party trackers or ad networks. It's also open source, so you can verify.\n• The UI is customizable - the theme, font, borders, and behaviors like confirmation dialogues and tooltips can be disabled.\n• Created from scratch - no frontend frameworks or 3rd-party libraries let me get everything just how I wanted it.\n\n\nSo if you're a developer or designer who works with CSS a lot, I hope these tools can be useful and save you some time. I'll be adding more tools over the coming weeks - so keep an eye out!\n\nI'd love to hear any questions, suggestions, ideas for other tools, criticism, or anything else you have to say!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "@linusgeffarth) and I've been building WikiSpaces on and off last year. But what's this all about?\n\n🥥 in a nutshell\nWikiSpaces 3D is about enabling people to go places *virtually*, where they couldn't go otherwise (physically), by providing a collection of such places as 3d-scans, \"spaces\" 🪐, explorable in VR (yes, also with vr glasses). (3D-scans made with Matterport.)\nThere are already some really cool spaces: from Boeing 747 cockpits to Egyptian temples or the LeBron James Arena!\n\n🤔 but why?\nMainly, it's about providing educational value and making knowledge accessible: in the times of the COVID-19 pandemic, students are not able to visit interesting places like museums or galleries; but if said place has been 3d-scanned and shared on WikiSpaces, students can visit it virtually.\nBut it's really about everyone: some of the spaces allow exclusive visits to places you could normally never go to, such as a Boeing 747 cockpit (unless your friend's friend is a pilot of course, ha), or simply places far far away.\n\n💰 really free?\nYes absolutely! Just like Wikipedia aims to share knowledge for free, WikiSpaces does too. Building WikiSpaces has been possible only because the 🇪🇺 EU has provided generous funding (subsidies) for this project.\nWhat about user-submitted content though? All spaces are shared under the CC BY 4.0 license.\n\n👉 what now?\nCheck out the featured spaces, or scroll down to the explore page and check out a space (or two if you'd like 😝). There are already some really cool spaces, from Boeing 747 cockpits to Egyptian temples or the LeBron James Arena!\nAnd then I'd love it if you could spread the word, share a link, and follow me on twitter @wikispaces3d (I'll be a bit more active there soon 🤞)\n\n❓ Questions? As away! Looking forward to hearing y'all's thoughts! 🙏\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "How many tech content do you read and save everyday?\n\nFor me: there's articles about DevOps, twitter thread about web dev, docs of Kubernetes… \n\nI read and saved 20+ resources everyday. 🧐\n\nI tried many tools for archiving resources, but none of them perfectly suit my workflow. So does others in Depths. 🙃\n\nWe hate having to tag resources with #Python or #WebDev then manually adding them to folders every single time. Especially when we got like  100+ tabs opening in the same moment. 🤯\n\nThat’s where we thought - what if there’s a solution that is:\n\n1️⃣ Simple\n2️⃣ Fast\n3️⃣ Automated\n\nThat’s why we decided to make Depths.\n\nOur goal is to help developers to archive & retrieve knowledge in the easiest way possible. To do this, Depths support:\n\n• Auto-tagging 🔖\n• Full-text search 🔍 \n• Estimated read time ⏳\n• Import your current bookmarks ⬇️\n•  … and more for you to explore!\n\nThis Alpha version is the first step of our project to make a better bookmark manager for devs. Our goal is to become the best knowledge base tool for devs on the market. 🚀\n\nAs a small team of 4 working part-time, user feedback means the world to us. Feel free to try it and let us know what you think of it! 💛\n\nWe’ll be here for the next 24 hours to answer your questions. Also you’re very welcome to come to our Discord server to chat with us! https://discord.gg/MSbqnVzB 👋\n\nP.S. If you followed me before, you'll know the previous product I made on is Savvy, which is also a bookmark manager but it didn't have product-market fit. Therefore we spent months on researching and pivoted it into Depths. And I wrote a blog about the entire process :) https://desmond-hth.medium.com/n...\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
