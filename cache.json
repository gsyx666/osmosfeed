I wanted to use my mirrorless camera as my webcam, which required a third-party kernel module called v4l2loopback to be loaded via modprobe.\nHowever, an unsigned kernel module can't be loaded on Fedora, see the kernel module signing process on Fedora docs. Therefore, if you need to modprobe anything outside the default kernel module, you'll have a lot of extra works to do instead of just sudo modprobe things. Moreover, if you upgrade the kernel, which happens very often on Fedora, you'll need to sign the module again. I don't plan to work on a system that would break my tools now and then.

In other words, what seems like the most mundane element of complex engineering tasks (moving stuff on time from point A to point B) is a surprisingly critical element of success.\nIf I had to force an analogy here, I'd say for the developer community that \"amateurs talk code, professionals talk integration\". It turns out that writing code (especially from scratch) is surprisingly easy, whereas putting code together (especially code you didn't write yourself) is surprisingly difficult.\nSo, in the world of JavaScript, how do we put code together?

          "description": "不要让文件权限拖你后腿。以下是在 Linux 和 macOS 上管理它们的方法。\n\r\n\r\n如果你通过网络或“跑腿网络”（将文件保存到硬盘，以将其复制到一台计算机）在两个用户之间共享文件，那么在尝试读取或写入文件时可能会遇到权限错误。即使你了解它的概念，你也可能不知道该如何诊断或解决问题。我曾经将数据迁移作为一项服务执行，因此我遇到了相当多的权限错误和所有权冲突。这是我快速修复它们的方法。\n\r\n1、确定正确的用户\n\r\n在修复权限错误之前，你必须确定需要权限的人是谁。你可能认为你已经知道这一点，但你可能没有意识到用户名并不是用户身份的最确定属性。你的计算机不会将你视为一个人，而是将你视为一个数字。要了解你的号码，请查看你的用户 ID：\n\r\n$ id --user\r\n1005\r\n\n\r\n2、获取当前所有者\n\r\n接下来，确定你无法与之交互的文件的所有者。由于发生了文件权限问题，你可能需要使用 sudo 命令查看有关文件的信息：\n\r\n$ sudo ls --numeric-uid-gid\r\n-rw------- 1 1000 100  23041 Aug  2 05:26 bar\r\n-rw------- 1 1000 100  54281 Aug  2 04:58 baz\r\n-rw------- 1 1000 100    822 Aug  2 08:19 foo\r\n\n\r\n在此示例中，拥有文件的用户被标识为用户 ID 1000，这就是用户 ID 1005 无法与它们交互的原因。更糟糕的是，这些文件标记为仅由拥有它们的用户可读和可写，因此即使是同一组的成员也不能与这些文件进行交互。\n\r\n3、更改权限以匹配\n\r\n你知道需要权限的用户，因此你可以更改当前所有者以匹配你当前的用户：\n\r\n$ sudo chown 1005 foo\r\n\n\r\n你还可以通过更改文件模式授予你的组成员以及系统上可能的其他用户对文件的访问权限。例如，在向组和任何其他用户授予读取权限（4）的同时保持读取和写入权限（7）：\n\r\n$ sudo chmod 744 foo\r\n\n\r\n了解更多\n\r\n当你对文件权限不熟悉时，它们似乎很棘手。有关文件所有权如何工作的更多信息，请阅读 chown 简介。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/8/fix-file-permission-errors-linux\n\r\n作者：Seth Kenlon 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "微软再次改变对已知的 MSDT 漏洞的立场\n\r\n尽管之前微软声称 DogWalk 漏洞不构成安全问题，但微软现在已经发布了一个补丁，以阻止攻击者积极利用该漏洞。该漏洞允许攻击者利用 Windows 微软支持诊断工具（MSDT）的一个弱点，以欺骗用户访问一个虚假的网站或打开一个恶意的文件，最终在被攻击的系统上获得远程代码执行。该漏洞在 2020 年 1 月首次被报告，影响到所有支持的 Windows 版本。但当时微软表示，它不认为该漏洞是一个安全问题。这是近几个月来微软第二次被迫改变对一个已知漏洞的立场，之前也曾拒绝承认另一个 MSDT 漏洞构成安全威胁，但在今年 6 月提供了补丁。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Computer World\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：其实有安全漏洞，对于微软的产品来说很正常，我好奇的是，微软为什么就不愿意承认，把 Bug 当功能呢？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n百度获得中国首批完全无人驾驶出租车的服务许可证\n\r\n据报道，中国首批完全自主的，没有安全司机的商业机器人出租车，即将在武汉和重庆对公众乘客开放。这两张新颁发的许可证允许百度在上述城市限定区域内提供无人驾驶收费出租车服务，每个区域将运行五辆第五代阿波罗汽车。如果车辆遇到任何棘手的情况，远程司机将会进行控制。之前，百度已经在中国一线城市使用相同的第五代汽车提供出租服务，但车上有备用司机。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：New Atlas\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看到百度能将资金和人力投入高科技行业是个好事，希望能转型成一家真正的高科技公司吧。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n英特尔 x86 CPU 份额跌破七成\n\r\n来自统计机构的最新数据显示，刚过去的二季度，桌面处理器销量创下 30 年来的新低，但 AMD 在移动笔记本、台式机、服务器以及整个 x86 市场的份额，都在继续增长。从整个 x86 处理器市场来看，AMD 的市场占比已经提高到 31.4%，也就是说英特尔的 x86 市场份额已不足七成。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Tom's Hardware\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然可能只是暂时的波动变化，但是 AMD 似乎越来越得到市场青睐。",

          "description": "经过了一个月，可能是在讨论、会谈和对话之后，Cutefish OS 正式重启了开发。\n\r\n不久前，我们报道了 Cutefish OS 停止开发，而且 GitHub 上没有任何活动。好吧，看起来开发者在 GitHub 上复活了这个项目，并对该操作系统的未来有了一些设想。\n\r\n7 月 31 日，Cutefish OS 的 GitHub 主仓库进行了更新，内容如下：\n\r\n\r\n你喜欢的 CutefishOS 现在回来了！新网站正在建设中（即将推出）\n\r\n\r\n不仅如此，该团队还简要介绍了这个项目的路线图。\n\r\n\n\r\nCutefish OS 的开发：即将到来的里程碑\n\r\n首先，主要目标是官方网站的准备工作。\n\r\n其次，根据 GitHub 上的说明，下一个版本可能会基于 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS。Cutefish OS 有不同的桌面定制版，如 Ubuntu 和 Debian。另外，你可以在 Arch Linux 上只安装Cutefish 桌面。\n\r\n第三，该团队旨在评估当前的问题并开始接受拉取请求。完成这项工作后，将更容易确定需要修复的项目的优先次序。最后，为未来版本的新功能进行规划。\n\r\n不仅如此，还有一种可能性，即用 openEuler Linux 开发新的 Cutefish 桌面定制版。openEuler Linux 是华为为商业和企业用途而创建的一个发行版。\n\r\n\n\r\n（LCTT 译注：但是从 GitHub 仓库来看，最近并没有任何实质动作。）\n\r\n一个新的名字？\n\r\n当我在寻找更多的信息时，我发现该团队注册了一个新的域名，有一个新的名字，即 openfish.org（LCTT 译注：因无备案，展示无法访问）。桌面环境或整个操作系统将被重新命名为 openfish。在这一点上，我有一个猜测：\n\r\n旧的域名 cutefishos.com 可能被别人接管了，因此这样决定。\n\r\n但是，在我看来，“openfish” 是一个比 “cutefish” 更好的品牌名称。\n\r\n（LCTT 译注：究竟是原班人马中的部分人决定重启，还是整个团队复活，目前不得而知，从改名上看，似乎新的团队并没有 cutefish 相关的品牌控制权。）\n\r\n下一步是什么\n\r\n最新的 0.8 版有几个与键盘、设置窗口、Flatpak 应用程序等有关的问题。最好的办法是在最后的基线上首先解决这些问题。然后可能是带有额外功能的 1.0 版本。\n\r\n希望在未来几周内，我们能看到更多关于开发的更新。如果你想发表意见，询问有关期望或功能要求，在 GitHub 上创建一个帖子。\n\r\n欢迎回来，Cutefish OS。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/cutefish-development-restarts/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "开源是一个具有挑战性的概念。许多人认为，开源意味着可以任意的使用软件，并且可以免费下载。这实际上取决于你如何被许可 —— 开发者分享代码时使用的许可证决定了它。开源软件可以是收费的，也可以限制你如何去使用它，在极少数情况下，甚至让你陷入法律纠纷。\n\r\nFedora 项目最近决定拒绝所有使用 知识共享Creative Commons “公共领域专用” CC0 许可证的代码，以避免这种情况的出现。CC0 将从新提交代码中准许使用的许可证列表中剔除，但是，像艺术品一类的贡献仍被允许所以它，甚至可能在个案的情况下对当前的软件包进行逐一的处理。\n\r\n如果 Fedora 反对一个软件许可证，通常不会成为新闻。事实上，在那么多的许可证当中，该项目拒绝了许多许可证。这种情况的意外之处在于，CC0 最初被认为是一个有效的许可证，现在只是由于更大的自由及开源（FOSS）社区内的观点转变而被重新分类。\n\r\nCC0 是因为什么让 Fedora 决定停止支持它，这又是否意味着你不能在你自己的项目中使用它呢？\n\r\n这一段描述让最熟悉知识共享及其许可系列的人惊讶的是，Fedora 最初批准了 CC0 的软件。毕竟，知识共享从一开始的目标是为艺术作品提供一系列明确的许可证。该组织的使命和许可证的要求在其名称“知识共享”中就有所体现。\n\r\n为了“克服分享信息和创造力的法律障碍”，提供一个自由的框架来为人们组织分享如音乐、医学或教育材料的资源，知识共享组织的前身——开放内容项目Open Content Project，于 2001 年成立。然而，软件从来不是它的组成要素。为什么呢？因为那时，如 MIT、GPL 一类的重要的软件许可证已经出现了十几年。\n\r\n很明显，如果一家公司不遗余力地警告你他们制造的东西不适合某种特定用途，你也许应该相信他们。知识共享的 FAQ 列出了一些反对在软件上使用他们的许可证的令人信服的论据，但对于像 Fedora 项目这样的用户来说，其中一个问题特别突出：专利权。\n\r\n鉴于 CC0 许可证是为公共领域的作品准备的，而且通过使用它，创作者明确地“放弃了他或她在版权法下对作品的所有权利”，这似乎矛盾的。但是，问题在于，版权法并不适用于专利。事实上，仔细审视许可证的完整措辞后可以发现，它在一个令人担忧的部分解决了这个问题，该部分内容如下：“宣告者拥有的任何商标或专利权都没有被本文本放弃、抛弃、交出、租赁或以其他方式修改。”\n\r\n换言之，即使被 CC0 许可的东西的作者可能愿意放弃对它的权力，但他们仍然可以自由的为它申请专利。更糟糕的是，他们仍然保留着以他们认为合适的方式使用该专利的能力。\n\r\n理论上来说，这意味着最初在 CC0 下提供的源代码的人在发布了代码之后，他们可能会在之后断言任何使用该代码的人侵犯了他们的专利，并要求支付专利费。\n\r\n这显然会让像 Fedora 这样的项目担忧。考虑一下这样的情形：CC0 许可的代码进入到一个系统的核心，然后被提供给数以百万计的用户。突然间，不知道从哪里冒出来的原创作者，声称侵犯了专利权，并要求付款。红帽或 Fedora 的律师可以驳倒这种说法么？也许吧。那么，为了查明真相而使用 CC0 代码值得么？不值得。\n\r\n要着重提到的是，这完全不是一个新问题。实际上，早在 2012 年，专利条款就阻止了开源倡议（OSI）许可证的审查委员会，他们无法最终确定 CC0 是否真正符合他们对开源许可证的定义。委员会未能达成一致意见，因为其成员认为将此类条款纳入软件许可将创造一个危险的先例。考虑到 Fedora 动荡的历史，它最初接受 CC0 的决定着实让人费解。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/08/what-made-fedora-choose-to-use-cc0-licensed-code-as-the-boot/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：yjacks 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "经济独立后，我很快发现自己之前的消费方式需要调整。\n我之前买东西几乎没有计划，大部分是偶发性的，也有很多冲动购买。其次，我对价格有些不敏感，总觉得平台上是这个价格那就这样吧；对很多产品的质量也没有概念，常常不知道该从何判断。比如买水果，我都是让商家随机装一些就过秤拿走。我也很少考虑买东西之后的处置行为，比如多久该把东西淘汰，日用品一般要屯多久等等。\n我逐渐觉得，我应该花些心思调整自己的生活和消费——我需要一个能让我在「重复购买」「快速更迭」的商品上省钱，可以为生活长远算计的在线平台。1688 就这样进入了我的视野。\n1688 建立的初衷是为批发商或者商户找到合适的生产商，由于平台允许商户购买样品，所以个人消费者也可以在 1688 上进行购买。在 1688 平台进行了大半年采买后，我想和大家分享一下我的购物体验和购物感受，也欢迎各位朋友分享你的「批发」心得。\n本文分享的所有产品和卖家均是来自于自己及朋友购买经历，不含有任何广告或者宣传。\n在 1688 购物的原因\n在 1688 购物主要就是为了两方面：规划预算省钱，适量囤货日用。1688 正好在这两点都是强项。\n各大社交平台都有博主提过，同款的产品，其他购物平台基本价格一致，而 1688 上可以便宜一半甚至是更多。因为 1688 上的卖方是生产商，少了很多分销渠道的成本和加价。这也是为什么 1688 会有很多东西便宜到让人惊讶的原因，毕竟「要批发，上 1688」。\n举个例子，我在南方经常要用的除湿袋，在 1688 上的价格是 0.7 元一包，购买超过 250 包，会便宜到 0.68 元。而在当地超市买到的同款至少一包 2 元，有些网购平台甚至要 5 元一包。\n这是我楼下超市卖的同款，非常好用，五块钱一包。\n偶尔一包可能价格差距不大，但这种除湿袋我每年都会用掉很多，累计起来就不在少数了，带上全寝室批发则开销更大。类似的还有袜子、…",

          "description": "「记录」这件事就是非常有威力，它会把注意力之外的小细节收集起来，给予一种确实发生但又意料之外的生活视角。比如如果不是记账，我不知道原来每个月会支出那么多零零碎碎的「拿铁因子」；如果不是 HiWater，我也不会知道原来自己摄入那么多含糖饮料。\n其实我很早之前就购买过 WaterMinder 这款 App Store Editors's Choice 应用，只是彼时的我并不明白「多喝水」三个字对身体的意义，同时也觉得记录喝水这件事就像是记账——没有外部约束、「记录多少全凭诚实美德」的记录只在于自我娱乐。所以往往三天后意兴阑珊删除了事。\nHiWater 则是好友 @特伦 推荐的，把玩了下觉得还不错，但当时并不想为这个需求掏钱；不久前确诊痛风后，离开诊室满心灰暗的我有了「每天喝水 3L+」的刚需，这才发现这款应用的每一个付费点都值得我掏钱。\n作为一款国产应用，HiWater 的饮品目录预设种类都比较契合日常，并且在目录处还醒目地标注了每 100 毫升所带有的千卡热量。向下翻阅到高热量饮品时甚至有一种黑名单的既视感。\n\n如此设计的部分原因是，HiWater 采用了「饮水金字塔」模型，它将所有饮品归在六个等级内，并依此建议每日摄入的比例。此模型虽有哈佛大学公共卫生学院专家的背书，总体指导思想依然是鼓励大家多喝白水，减少摄入高糖、甚至是含糖饮料。\n关联阅读：如何合理控制糖分摄入\n\n对喝水提醒应用来说，我们一般会面临预设饮品难以覆盖真实世界情况的问题。\n所以在 HiWater 中我们也可以新增或编辑饮品类目到「饮水金字塔」模型中，把某个模糊的品类变成精确的单品。比如说 HiWater 预设了椰子水这个饮品，但我日常喝得比较多的是山姆椰子水，那我就直接编辑成山姆椰子水的营养成分，并重新归类到低卡饮料分类中去；再比如我喝的柠檬水是浓缩液和水 1:10 冲兑而来，因此我也通过计算将预设的「柠檬水」编辑成「自制柠檬水」，并由浓缩液计算出对应的热量。\n当然，手动编辑多了我们自然就会想：这些外包装上带有营养成分表的商品饮料，如何快捷记录到应用内？\nHiWater 的答案是「直接用相机扫」，请直接看这个动图：\n\n我猜测可能 Apple 在系统中给了 OCR 相关的 API，开发者就取来做这个功能了。这是我最喜欢的功能，实际使用起来识别比动图中要更迅速，识别率高且稳定。偶尔可能会有一些识别错误，比如把 ≥ 识别成 2，但我也能原谅。\n如此一来，在机场购买的农夫山泉力量帝柠檬水、屯了两箱的兰芳园低糖冻柠茶，都可以统统扫入我的饮品目录。记录时也可以根据自己的实际情况调整，比如冻柠茶虽是低糖，我还是会将它兑冰水或柠檬水喝，因此我的喝水记录里经常会出现 50 毫升的冻柠茶、紧接着出现 200 毫升的水或柠檬水。\n\n之前做手冲咖啡用的秤，现在大多被我用于称水喝，但后续我发现只要记住水倒在杯子上的花纹位置，不用秤也能大致知道这杯水的量。以名创优品的 580 毫升容积的可乐杯为例，杯内两道凹痕，分别可以粗略看作是 200/500 毫升的刻度。在公司喝水，可以考虑在工位启用大杯子装水，之前因为杯子小+次数少，上班时喝水太少。一周下来，确实每日喝水 3.3L 以上。\n\n其余的基础功能，诸如弹出提醒用户喝水、身体水分的简单预估、根据用户情况估算需要摄入的水量等，我就不一一展开了，WaterMinder 也有，我认为这些是一款「喝水类」App 都应该做的免费功能。其实我原先也是想通过快捷指令自己做一个提醒和记录每日喝水的应用，这不难，我甚至已经做好了 社死版快捷指令 定时运行，但体验过 HiWater 的一些交互后，我最后决定不折腾自己了。\n应用内还有不少花心思的交互和设计\nHiWater 多样的桌面小组件，还支出快捷录入饮品，打破了我对 iOS 小组件「能看不能用」的固有认知（我原先在 iOS 上并不使用任何 Widget，这一下就微上瘾了，顺带一口气添加了其余应用的小组件 xD）。\n精美的 Widget，支持快捷录入\nHiWater 采用免费下载+内购解锁的付费机制，如果你看完文章对它感兴趣，安装来把玩把玩也可以。如果想要为它付费的话，建议先确认自己有强烈的督促自己喝水的需求，然后订阅一个月试试——我直接买断是因为意识到「多喝水」这样的生活我可能要持续好几个月，甚至好几年，本身并不是很理性的消费习惯。\n如果一个应用能够帮助我长期维持某个健康习惯，我愿意给出「十刀买断，天大划算」的评价；如果没有，我也会用「三分钟热度三分钟收获」来安慰自己。\n> 下载 少数派 2.0 客户端、关注 少数派公众号，解锁全新阅读体验 📰\n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀",
