My first real time was when I went to a few VB6 classes and convinced my parents to buy me a book.\nFor me it was like magic, I could tell the computer what to do and it would do it, as long as I didn’t fuck it up somehow (which happened a lot at that time).

I can call myself a developer for over 15 years now, and a tinkerer for a few more. I started playing with technology from the very young age of 7, when I entered and won a race event where I built a toy solar car. Till today, as a system architect and having some successes (and failures) at tech startups, and running my own dev & consulting business.\nAs of late, my team and I have released the first of our libraries as open source, this has made me look back at the path that led me here. My main goal is to share that story, the ups and downs (and sometimes sideways) and hopefully it will help someone on their path. I can’t promise it will be interesting all the time (or even pretty), but I hope you will join me for the journey.\nI will be writing this as a few different posts, each one not much longer than this one, as I want it to be a quick and fun read. So this is the plan:\nThe story of a Noob — My somewhat humble beginnings\nThe journey begins — Teaching myself in the age before google\nThey don’t call it intelligence for nothing — My military career\nSchool can’t teach you everything — My time at Uni and my first freelance work\nIt’s time to settle down — My first real job\nGood code is like an onion, it has layers — The right way to write code\nMy eureka moment — After writing the same code over and over, something had to change\nIt’s ALIVE — My solution to CRUD boilerplate, and the evolution of the layers\nShit just got real — Using what I learned to land a big contract\nTime to give back — The birth of my first open source",

          "description": "制造固态硬盘产生的碳排放远超硬盘\n\r\n固态硬盘的耗电量远低于硬盘，但一项新的研究意外地显示，它们的终生碳足迹要比硬盘高得多。研究人员测量了固态硬盘和硬盘在整个生命周期中每 GB 的碳足迹，他们发现，虽然固态硬盘在使用过程中的碳排放低于硬盘，但在制造过程中的碳密度要远高于硬盘。每制造一个 1TB 的固态硬盘会排放相当于 320 公斤的二氧化碳。相比之下，同等容量的硬盘只排放 40 公斤。而综合使用过程的碳排放，1 TB 的固态硬盘的终生碳足迹是 369.2 公斤二氧化碳，而硬盘是 199 公斤。另外，一台台式电脑的碳足迹几乎有 40% 来自固态硬盘，而 CPU 只占 4%，GPU 占 11%。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Discover Magazine\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：固态硬盘就和新能源车一样，有些水面下的成本是你看不到的。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n树莓派 4 增加对 3D API 的支持\n\r\n树莓派基金会宣布，树莓派 4 符合 Vulkan 1.2 标准。树莓派的现在的桌面图形是由 OpenGL 驱动的，Vulkan 要取代的是旧的图形 API。该 API 可以为开发者提供与 2019 年英伟达显卡、2020 年英特尔集成显卡芯片和其他几十种设备相同的 3D 图形能力。对于大多数将树莓派用作服务器、DIY 控制器或轻型桌面的人来说，对 Vulkan 1.2 的支持并不重要。但是对游戏和 3D 应用来说应该会受益。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：ARS Technica\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然我想不出用树莓派玩 3D 游戏是什么体验，但是或许有比玩游戏更有趣的场景。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nWinamp 5.9 释出首个 RC 版本\n\r\n去年底，我们曾经报道过 Winamp 准备重启。现在，这个曾经最流行的音乐播放器 Winamp 释出了 Winamp 5.9 RC1。开发者称，对终端用户来说，Winamp 5.9 RC1 可能变化不大，但底层代码库进行了重大重构。在基础工作完成之后，他们将可以开始给软件修复和增添功能。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Winamp\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然可能有些过时了，但是曾经的 Winamp 还是有很多人怀念。",

          "description": "GNOME 正计划通知用户其固件安全状态，来保护不安全的硬件。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n当你在支持 UEFI 的电脑上安装 Linux 时，你必须禁用“安全启动Secure Boot”，因为启用该选项后，不能使用现场 USBLive USB 启动。\n\r\n一些主流的 Linux 发行版支持安全启动，但对于许多其他发行版（以及板载的 Nvidia 硬件）来说，它的设置仍然具有挑战性。\n\r\n虽然一年又一年，情况似乎并没有改善，但总的来说，安全启动是一个必不可少的保护功能。\n\r\n因此，正如 Phoronix 所发现的，为了方便和让用户意识到这一点，GNOME 和红帽的开发者正在努力在安全启动被禁用时通知（或警告）用户。\n\r\n它有什么用？\n\r\nUEFI/安全启动被批评为 DRM，因为它剥夺了用户的自由。开源社区的许多人仍然不赞同实施 UEFI/安全启动和 TPM，因为它带来了不便。这就催生了像 Coreboot 这样的项目在开源世界中蓬勃发展。\n\r\n当然，如果你每天都用 Linux，我会建议你购买支持 Coreboot 的新硬件，这是一个不同的故事。\n\r\n话虽如此，但可以肯定的是，安全启动是最简单的方法。\n\r\n考虑到捆绑的专有固件，安全启动的安全性仍然值得商榷。但是，它是一个确保系统的固件安全的基本保护机制。\n\r\n所以，开发者准备在启动闪屏（Plymouth）、GNOME 显示管理器（GDM）和 GNOME 控制中心显示警告。\n\r\n\n\r\nGNOME 的一位开发者在 博客文章 中分享了它的更多细节，同时给出了其中的一些屏幕截图。\n\r\n\n\r\n一位来自红帽的开发者在 合并请求 中提到。\n\r\n\r\n安全启动被用来对付一些恶意软件试图感染系统的固件的安全威胁。用户可能会无意中禁用或软件可能会有意禁用安全启动。因此，配置不正确的话，系统就运行在一个不安全的平台上。如果启动闪屏能向用户提供一个警告，用户可以重新启动并重新配置他们的系统，或者立即寻求帮助。\n\r\n\r\n所以，作为一个 GNOME 用户，当它进入 GNOME 43 的最终版本或任何未来的版本时，我乐于看到它所带来的变化。\n\r\n如果你也想看看，你可以在 GNOME 控制中心的“隐私Privacy”标签下的“设备安全Device Security”部分找到这个选项，如下图所示，我的机器在 Arch Linux 上运行 GNOME 43 alpha。\n\r\n\n\r\n该菜单还可以显示 TPM、英特尔 BootGuard 和 IOMMU 保护的细节。\n\r\n\n\r\n看来我的系统并不像我想象的那么安全……但也许这就是这个功能的意义所在？\n\r\n如果你只在你的 Linux 发行版上使用 UEFI 模式，并且为了方便而关闭了安全保护功能，这能让你意识到这一点吗？\n\r\n有可能。但是，看看 Linux 发行版的状况和启用安全启动的问题。我不觉得这可能会是一个大问题。我们很快就会知道了。\n\r\n如何禁用这个警告？\n\r\n正如在 GNOME Gitlab 的 合并请求 中提到的，在你的内核参数中添加 sb-check=false 就可以禁用这些警告。\n\r\n不过，作为终端用户，你不需要担心这个问题。\n\r\n你对即将在 GNOME 43 或更高版本中增加的这个功能有什么看法？你对 UEFI/安全启动有什么看法？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/gnome-secure-boot-warning/\n\r\n作者：Anuj Sharma 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "「记录」这件事就是非常有威力，它会把注意力之外的小细节收集起来，给予一种确实发生但又意料之外的生活视角。比如如果不是记账，我不知道原来每个月会支出那么多零零碎碎的「拿铁因子」；如果不是 HiWater，我也不会知道原来自己摄入那么多含糖饮料。\n其实我很早之前就购买过 WaterMinder 这款 App Store Editors's Choice 应用，只是彼时的我并不明白「多喝水」三个字对身体的意义，同时也觉得记录喝水这件事就像是记账——没有外部约束、「记录多少全凭诚实美德」的记录只在于自我娱乐。所以往往三天后意兴阑珊删除了事。\nHiWater 则是好友 @特伦 推荐的，把玩了下觉得还不错，但当时并不想为这个需求掏钱；不久前确诊痛风后，离开诊室满心灰暗的我有了「每天喝水 3L+」的刚需，这才发现这款应用的每一个付费点都值得我掏钱。\n作为一款国产应用，HiWater 的饮品目录预设种类都比较契合日常，并且在目录处还醒目地标注了每 100 毫升所带有的千卡热量。向下翻阅到高热量饮品时甚至有一种黑名单的既视感。\n\n如此设计的部分原因是，HiWater 采用了「饮水金字塔」模型，它将所有饮品归在六个等级内，并依此建议每日摄入的比例。此模型虽有哈佛大学公共卫生学院专家的背书，总体指导思想依然是鼓励大家多喝白水，减少摄入高糖、甚至是含糖饮料。\n关联阅读：如何合理控制糖分摄入\n\n对喝水提醒应用来说，我们一般会面临预设饮品难以覆盖真实世界情况的问题。\n所以在 HiWater 中我们也可以新增或编辑饮品类目到「饮水金字塔」模型中，把某个模糊的品类变成精确的单品。比如说 HiWater 预设了椰子水这个饮品，但我日常喝得比较多的是山姆椰子水，那我就直接编辑成山姆椰子水的营养成分，并重新归类到低卡饮料分类中去；再比如我喝的柠檬水是浓缩液和水 1:10 冲兑而来，因此我也通过计算将预设的「柠檬水」编辑成「自制柠檬水」，并由浓缩液计算出对应的热量。\n当然，手动编辑多了我们自然就会想：这些外包装上带有营养成分表的商品饮料，如何快捷记录到应用内？\nHiWater 的答案是「直接用相机扫」，请直接看这个动图：\n\n我猜测可能 Apple 在系统中给了 OCR 相关的 API，开发者就取来做这个功能了。这是我最喜欢的功能，实际使用起来识别比动图中要更迅速，识别率高且稳定。偶尔可能会有一些识别错误，比如把 ≥ 识别成 2，但我也能原谅。\n如此一来，在机场购买的农夫山泉力量帝柠檬水、屯了两箱的兰芳园低糖冻柠茶，都可以统统扫入我的饮品目录。记录时也可以根据自己的实际情况调整，比如冻柠茶虽是低糖，我还是会将它兑冰水或柠檬水喝，因此我的喝水记录里经常会出现 50 毫升的冻柠茶、紧接着出现 200 毫升的水或柠檬水。\n\n之前做手冲咖啡用的秤，现在大多被我用于称水喝，但后续我发现只要记住水倒在杯子上的花纹位置，不用秤也能大致知道这杯水的量。以名创优品的 580 毫升容积的可乐杯为例，杯内两道凹痕，分别可以粗略看作是 200/500 毫升的刻度。在公司喝水，可以考虑在工位启用大杯子装水，之前因为杯子小+次数少，上班时喝水太少。一周下来，确实每日喝水 3.3L 以上。\n\n其余的基础功能，诸如弹出提醒用户喝水、身体水分的简单预估、根据用户情况估算需要摄入的水量等，我就不一一展开了，WaterMinder 也有，我认为这些是一款「喝水类」App 都应该做的免费功能。其实我原先也是想通过快捷指令自己做一个提醒和记录每日喝水的应用，这不难，我甚至已经做好了 社死版快捷指令 定时运行，但体验过 HiWater 的一些交互后，我最后决定不折腾自己了。\n应用内还有不少花心思的交互和设计\nHiWater 多样的桌面小组件，还支出快捷录入饮品，打破了我对 iOS 小组件「能看不能用」的固有认知（我原先在 iOS 上并不使用任何 Widget，这一下就微上瘾了，顺带一口气添加了其余应用的小组件 xD）。\n精美的 Widget，支持快捷录入\nHiWater 采用免费下载+内购解锁的付费机制，如果你看完文章对它感兴趣，安装来把玩把玩也可以。如果想要为它付费的话，建议先确认自己有强烈的督促自己喝水的需求，然后订阅一个月试试——我直接买断是因为意识到「多喝水」这样的生活我可能要持续好几个月，甚至好几年，本身并不是很理性的消费习惯。\n如果一个应用能够帮助我长期维持某个健康习惯，我愿意给出「十刀买断，天大划算」的评价；如果没有，我也会用「三分钟热度三分钟收获」来安慰自己。\n> 下载 少数派 2.0 客户端、关注 少数派公众号，解锁全新阅读体验 📰\n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀",

          "description": "很多人都有显性或隐性的心理问题，需要依托一些手段改善或治疗。常见的心理治疗为行为治疗、认知治疗、人本主义疗法、团体治疗等等。不过，从二十世纪六十年代至今以来，综合疗法（Eclectic/Integrative therapy) ，即采用结合各种方向的各种方法进行治疗，仍然是广受欢迎的治疗手段，其中最为有效的是认知-行为疗法（CBT）。\n本文中，我们要来谈一种相对特殊的治疗方案——家庭治疗。家庭治疗虽然在国内外应用的都不多，但是背后的一些方法，也许能够帮助到我们目前疫情之下的紧张的家庭关系。比如文中介绍的叙事疗法、绘制家系图、专注解决方法等都是一些平时可以自己或者和家人一起试着练习的方法。\n什么是家庭治疗\n家庭治疗兴起于二十世纪中期，属于团体治疗（group therpay）的一部分。他们一致反对主流的声音，即认为心理症状只来自于个体本身，提出心理问题其实是来自个体与他人相处方式受到干扰所带来的副产品。\n家庭治疗认为，心理症状是个体所处的家庭由于功能失调所带来的副产品。\n家庭治疗师从哲学和科学当中借鉴了一个理论：系统方法（system approach），即整体大于部分之和。换句话说，其实是从个人治疗的思想中切换到以家庭为单位（faimly-unit）治疗思想。治疗师关注的是整个家庭状况，而不是单独针对个人，将责任归咎于家庭中的某个人，或者指责某个人。所以，家庭治疗中，最基本的东西。过程中，家庭成员与治疗师一起努力，改善成员之间的互动，从而加强每个成员的心理健康。\n系统理论\n系统方法的核心是循环因果关系（Circular causality）比线性因果关系（Linear causality）更能解释心理问题。\n\n线性因果关系（Linear Casuality）：A 影响 B；但 B 不影响 A。意思是，父母对待孩子的方式影响孩子的后续行为，但孩子的后续行为并不会反过来影响父母…",

          "description": "自《PasteNow for iOS 正式发布》后，已有三个月没有介绍 PasteNow 了。这三个月，PasteNow 也没有停止进化的脚步，分别迭代了 2.1、2.2 和 2.3 这几个版本，其中 2.3 于今天刚刚发布。本篇即是汇总一下过去三个月 PasteNow 的发展与变化。\n支持 Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴\n正如标题所说，2.3 版本带来了「Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴」的功能。这是 PasteNow 迄今为止非常重要的一个改进，不仅带来更加一致的体验，同时也大大提升效率。解决这个问题其实有点周折，我先简单地补充一下背景：\n\nWord 和 Pages，因为其固有机制的原因（也许是 Bug），它不支持剪贴板的多项目粘贴。也就说是，往剪贴板里写入多项内容，再在 Word 里操作粘贴，你会发现只有第一个内容粘贴了进去，但是如果同样在备忘录（或其他 App）里操作粘贴，是会出现多个内容的。\n\nPasteNow 的用户最早在去年7月就给我汇报了这个问题，当时我发现是 Word 和 Pages 的固有机制导致的问题后，决定暂时观察一段时间，因为也许 Word 在更新后会「修复」这个问题。\n但是等了很久，这个行为始终没有发生变化，看来确实是固有机制的限制了。正好最近又有用户汇报了相关问题，我换了一下思路，看看能不能从 PasteNow 这边做点什么的方式来解决这个问题。于是还真让我找到了一个办法。\n假如你是 Word、Pages 等的重度用户，经常需要粘贴内容至 Word、Pages 里，特别是一次性粘贴多项内容，现在通过 PasteNow 可以更好的做到这些了。请看视频！\n \n更加全面和完善的快捷键体验\n作为一个效率工具，能100%通过快捷键来达成各种操作一直是 PasteNow 重点优化的方向。在过去几个版本中，PasteNow 加强了以下两方面的快捷键体验：\n\n支持将 F1～F12 录制成快捷键了，这意味着可以用更加轻松的「单键」来达成 PasteNow 的各项操作；\n支持通过按下“@、%、$”等特殊符号也进入快速搜索模式；\n「添加标题」和「编辑文本」操作，也有了专属快捷键，分别是：Command + T 和 Command + E。\n\n相信通过以上快捷键的改进，使用 PasteNow 的过程将更加流畅。\niOS 版本的变化\n三个月前的主要事件是 iOS 版本的发布，过去三个月，iOS 版本发展的怎么样呢？这里不得不承认一个事实，这个版本并没有达到各种预期，无论是我作为开发者的预期，还是用户对它的预期。\n首先是我作为开发者的预期，目前 iOS 版本的用户非常少，日活跃用户最多时仅为 macOS 版本的 1/15。相当于 15 个 macOS 版本用户才对应 1 个 iOS 版本。这其实也是在我的预期中，但没想到会差这么多。\n另一方面是作为用户的预期，很多用户对这款 iOS 产品寄予了厚望，以为也可以像 macOS 版本一样做到后台记录剪贴板内容、实时同步剪贴板数据。但事实是这个从 iOS 的机制上就做不到，并且在即将发布的 iOS 16 里，对剪贴板的操作将会进一步变得更难。\n以上当然不是用户预期的问题，而是我在打造这款产品时没有准确的传达信息导致的，后续在 iOS 版本中，我将增加一个 FAQ 模块，让用户可以非常直观地了解到这个工具能做什么，不能做什么等等。\n当然，我依然会尽力去完善 iOS 版本的体验，使其与 macOS 的基本功能靠近，比如在 2.3 版本当中，图片类的数据，现在也可以通过长按保存至相册了。这个是会比较实用且基础的一个操作。\n小结\nPasteNow 从 1.0 发布到今天，不过一年又三个多月，它依然是一款年轻的产品，我会继续按照既定节奏去稳步迭代，不断完善它的体验与其他 App 的互操作能力。\n希望它继续给大家带来愉悦的效率之旅～\n附：少数派下载与购买链接。\n \n \n演示：PasteNow 2.3 多项目粘贴至 Word",

Most modern languages like Java, JavaScript, Python, etc., automatically print a stack trace when they encounter an unhandled exception, but not shell scripts. It would make it much easier to find and fix bugs in shell scripts if you could print a stack trace, and, with a little work, you can.\nShell scripts can span multiple files, and well-written code is further broken down into functions. Tracing issues when something goes wrong in a shell script can be difficult when these scripts get large enough. A stack trace that walks the code backward from the error to the beginning can sho…",

And the tools to work with and transform text files still exist on all Linux systems.\nLike other computer systems, early Unix printed on paper, using a typewriter-style printing device. These printers provided limited formatting options, but with clever application of Unix tools, you could prepare professional-looking documents.\nOne such tool was the pr tool, to prepare text documents for printing.

In my previous project (an NFT portfolio management tool), we got hundreds of requests from people who wanted to work there. And we didn’t do listings on other job boards. So, I wanted to build platform where people know more about this space and find new opportunities to work in the web3 companies. \n\nAlso, people will be able to get tokens while they are searching for a job.\n\nWill be glad to hear your feedback and ideas. \n\nP.S.

          "description": "https://boxyhq.com/)\n\nWe’re excited to see our vision to pioneer enterprise readiness come to life with our first product, SAML Jackson.\n\n🤔Problem:\n\nEnterprise customers demand a certain level of security with their services. One of these is SAML authentication so they can manage access using their own permissions. \n\nThe problem with this is that building a SAML integration takes a long time and you need to build an integration for each of your customer's identity providers (IdP). This takes your team's focus away from your core product and requires a lot of resources.  \n\n💡Solution:\n\nSAML Jackson by BoxyHQ removes the pain of enterprise readiness by offering an out-of-the-box solution for deploying SAML quickly and efficiently. All you need to do is connect your product to BoxyHQ and we manage everything else for you. As if that was not enough, we connect to almost every IdP so you can go from the first line of code to fully support SAML in as little as a week! \n\nKey features:\n🤝 Integrate SAML using your favorite OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect libraries\n🔨 Single integration with an instant connection to most IdPs\n☑️ Open-source\n🖥️ Admin UI to ease your customer support issues around SAML setup\n🎨 Custom support and advice on your setup\n📝 Extensive documentation\n\n💬 Feedback\nSAML Jackson is now live, and we’re looking forward to your thoughts and feedback, The team will be available to answer any questions you may have  🙌\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "@gerwin_fricke, @slava_tschurilin & @moritz_lochner here – we’re super excited to launch Casama:\n\n💰 What is Casama?\nCasama lets you create crypto trade positions that can be funded and executed as a group in minutes – no browser extensions, no complex settings. So you can share trading ideas with your friends and get a management fee if it performs well. \n\n🔥 Why did we start Casama?\nHave you ever posted a trading idea in a group chat without actually ever acting on it? \nAs crypto natives, we want to move fast on good trades. Instead of having vague discussions, back and forth decisions and potentially out on alpha 😱 \n \nThat's why we built Casama – to decide on actionable trades together with skin in the game.\n\n🧭 So far we’ve built:\n- Wizard to deploy investment pools with custom settings\n- Simple web-based wallet to interact with pools\n- Top-up via PayPal to convert fiat ($) to stablecoin (USDC)\n- Swapping integration to buy and trade tokens\n\n⚡️ Inviting friends and pooling funds in minutes – how is it possible?\n\nThat’s right, invite your friends and pool funds as easy as starting a group chat and paying with PayPal. We conceal complex hashes and automate all the tedious transactions so you don't have to do them.\n\n🙏 Your feedback is gold to us – please share any questions, ideas and comments below.\nWe're just kicking things off and would love hear from fellow makers! The team (of currently 5) is working heads down to improve the UX and features based on your input. Finally, the first 50 deposits get $20 for depositing $10!\n\nWebsite: https://www.casama.io/\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
