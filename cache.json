It is difficult to have full confidence in this architecture when there are many components and “a lot of moving parts” that could potentially fail. It is critical to handle failures in service-to-service calls gracefully. Also, we want to be sure that any resilience mechanisms we have in place such as error handling code, circuit breaker, health checks, retry, fallback, redundant instances, and so on. We can verify this with the help of the testing method Fault Injection 💉.\nThroughout the post, we get to know the types of possible failure…",

(the old way of adding React in Astro)\nLet's use the minimal started pack from Astro. This is the easiest to use as it's clean.\nmkdir astro-react && cd astro-react\n\nOnce you have your folder installed, you can install the minimal starter.\nnpm init astro -- --template minimal\n\nOnce installed, we'll have our super basic Astro started. Let's go ahead and add the React rendered.\nnpm run astro add react\n\nThis will add React and the rendered and the needed config to your Astro config file.\nYou should see…",

It can also  be used as Disaster Recovery  strategy by  making sure that backups are stored somewhere else and can be recovery in case of a disaster.\nIt is important to mention that storage gateway is nota free service. For more information regarding storage gateway prices , please check the link here \n\nAWS Storage Gateway offers three different types of gateways: File Gateway, Volume Gateway and Tape Gateway.\n File Gateway store files as block on amazon S3 using NFS or SMB protocol.\n\n Volume Gateway is used to backup volume data as EBS snapshots in Amazon S3 using the Iscsi protocol. It has 2 types of volumes: Store Volumes and Cash Volumes.\na.    Cache Volume store all on prem data on S3 and only keep recently accessed data locally. \nb.    Store Volume store the primary data locally while it is backups that data as EBS snapshot into S3.\n\n Tape Gateway (VTL) allow on prem orgs that already have a Tape Library to back up their virtual dates in S3\n\nOn the next post, I will be going into the details and also show how it is implemented.",

          "description": "你们好！我一直在编写一本关于调试的杂志（这是 目录的初稿）。\n\r\n作为其中的一部分，我认为阅读一些关于调试的学术论文可能会很有趣，上周 Greg Wilson 给我发了一些关于调试学术研究的论文。\n\r\n其中一篇论文（《建立一个调试教学的框架[付费墙]》）对我们有效调试所需的不同种类的知识/技能进行了分类，我非常喜欢。它来自另一篇关于故障排除的更一般性的论文：《学会排错：一个新的基于理论的设计架构》。\n\r\n我认为这个分类对于思考如何更好地进行调试是一个非常有用的结构，所以我把论文中的五个类别重新规划为你可以采取的行动，以提高调试的效率。\n\r\n以下是这些行动：\n\r\n1、学习代码库\n\r\n要调试一些代码，你需要了解你正在使用的代码库。\n\r\n这似乎有点显而易见（当然，不了解代码的工作原理，你就无法调试代码！）\n\r\n这种学习随着时间的推移会很自然地发生，而且实际上调试也是 学习 一个新的代码库如何工作的最好方法之一—— 看到一些代码是如何崩溃的，有助于你了解它是如何工作的。\n\r\n该论文将此称为“系统知识”。\n\r\n2、学习系统\n\r\n论文中提到，你需要了解编程语言，但我认为不止于此 —— 为了修复 bug，往往你需要学习很多更广泛的环境，而不仅仅是语言。\n\r\n举个例子，如果你是后端 Web 开发者，你可能需要的一些“系统”知识包括：\n\r\n\r\nHTTP 缓存如何工作\n\r\nCORS\n\r\n数据库事务是如何工作的\n\r\n\r\n我发现我经常需要更有意识地去学习像这样的系统性的东西 —— 我需要真正花时间去查找和阅读它们。\n\r\n该论文将此称为“领域知识”。\n\r\n3、学习你的工具\n\r\n现在有很多工具，例如：\n\r\n\r\n调试器（GDB 等）\n\r\n浏览器开发工具\n\r\n剖析器profiler\n\r\nstrace / ltrace\n\r\ntcpdump / wireshark\n\r\n核心转储\n\r\n甚至像错误信息这样的基本东西（如何正确阅读它们）\n\r\n\r\n我在这个博客上写了很多关于调试工具的文章，并且肯定学习这些工具给我带来了巨大的变化。\n\r\n该论文将此称为“处理性知识”。\n\r\n4、学习策略\n\r\n这是最模糊的一类，在如何高效调试的过程中，我们都有很多策略和启发式方法。比如说：\n\r\n\r\n写一个单元测试\n\r\n写一个小的独立程序来重现这个错误\n\r\n找到一个能工作的版本的代码，看看有什么变化\n\r\n打印出无数的东西\n\r\n增加额外的日志记录\n\r\n休息一下\n\r\n向朋友解释这个错误，然后在中途发现问题所在\n\r\n查看 GitHub 上的问题，看看是否有匹配的问题\n\r\n\r\n在写这本杂志的时候，我一直在思考这个类别，但我想让这篇文章简短，所以我不会在这里多说。\n\r\n该论文将此称为“战略知识”。\n\r\n5、获得经验\n\r\n最后一个类别是“经验”。这篇论文对此有一个非常有趣的评论：\n\r\n\r\n他们的研究结果并没有显示出新手和专家所采用的策略有什么明显的区别。专家只是形成了更多正确的假设，并且在寻找故障方面更有效率。作者怀疑这个结果是由于新手和专家之间的编程经验不同造成的。\n\r\n\r\n这真的引起了我的共鸣 —— 我遇到过很多第一次遇到时非常令人沮丧和困难的 bug，而在第五次、第十次或第二十次时就非常简单了。\n\r\n对我来说，这也是最直接的知识类别之一 —— 你需要做的就是调查一百万个 bug，反正这就是我们作为程序员的全部生活 : ) 。这需要很长的时间，但我觉得它发生得很自然。\n\r\n本文将此称为“经验知识”。\n\r\n就这样吧！\n\r\n我打算把这篇文章写得很短，我只是非常喜欢这个分类，想把它分享出来。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/08/30/a-way-to-categorize-debugging-skills/\n\r\n作者：Julia Evans 选题：lkxed 译者：aftermath0703 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Apache OpenOffice 下载量超过 3.33 亿次，主要是 Windows 用户\n\r\n虽然 Apache OpenOffice 开源办公套件的发展几乎停滞不前，而 LibreOffice 一直在提供更现代的特性和功能，有趣的是，人们仍然在继续下载和使用 OpenOffice。Apache 软件基金会在周二宣布，自从他们在 2011 年接管这个开源办公套件以来，现在已经有超过 3.33 亿次下载。有些讽刺的是，根据公开的数字显示，Windows 用户的下载量为 2.97 亿，macOS 用户的下载量为 3100 万，而 Linux 用户的下载量仅为 470 万。另外，在 2020 年他们庆祝下载了 3 亿次。也就是说前 10 年平均每年有 3000 万次，而最近两年平均 1600 万次。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：Linux 用户数很少的一个原因是，几乎所有桌面 Linux 都预装的是 LibreOffice 而不是 OpenOfficce。这算不算唯一的 Windows 用户远超 Linux 用户的大型开源软件？另外，作为一个参考，2018 年，LibreOffice 说他们有 2 亿活跃用户，下载量理论上更多。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nQEMU 7.1 发布，支持 LoongArch 64 位架构\n\r\nQEMU 7.1 在开源 Linux 虚拟化堆栈中发挥着重要作用。在最新的版本中，提供了对 LoongArch 64 位架构的初步支持，目标是为了匹配 Loongson 3A5000 SoC 和 Loongson 7A1000 主机桥。此版本还增加了对 RISC-V 1.12 特权规格的支持。支持 Linux 上的 QEMU 的零拷贝发送，以减少虚拟机迁移时对源主机的 CPU 占用。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：QEMU 对龙芯的支持意义重大，虽然我对龙芯对 RISC-V 的批评不以为然，但是看到龙芯的发展还是应该点个赞。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n恶意应用伪装成谷歌翻译桌面应用来挖矿\n\r\n尽管谷歌翻译从未推出过桌面版，但是用户搜索就可能会在结果页面看到一些免费软件网站提供下载。IT 安全组织 CPR 发布了一份报告，称其发现了隐藏在看起来合法的应用程序背后的加密挖掘恶意软件活动。这些欺诈程序包括桌面版的谷歌翻译、Yandex 翻译、微软翻译、YouTube Music 等等。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Checkpoint\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然我们肯定不会从第三方下载来源不明的这种所谓官方应用，但是真有大量用户去下载。",

          "description": "Debian 终于开始考虑将非自由固件纳入一般决议中了。那么，将会如何呢？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n由于其稳定性和新功能之间的平衡的做法，Debian 是最受欢迎的 Linux 发行版之一。\n\r\n但是，它并没有配备任何非自由固件。\n\r\n对于想在新硬件上使用 Debian 的用户来说，这已经成为一个问题。\n\r\n大多数最新的设备和配置都需要非自由固件来使其工作，这包括 Wi-Fi、图形显示等等。\n\r\n为了解决这个问题，前 Debian 项目负责人、开发者 Steve McIntyre 已经对此积极讨论了一段时间。最近在 DebConf 22 会议上，正如 Geeker's Digest 所发现的那样，Steve 谈到了修复固件的混乱局面，更好地向用户和开发者表明了这一点。\n\r\n现在社区中讨论的进展是，看起来 Debian 已经启动了一项一般决议，让其利益相关者投票决定如何处理非自由固件的问题。\n\r\nDebian 的一般决议提案\n\r\n这个一般决议案有四个提案（LCTT 译注：原文和官方提案说明不够清晰，我根据理解重新梳理了）：\n\r\n\r\n提案 A：改变原有的官方镜像集（安装镜像和实况镜像），Debian 将在官方镜像中包含非自由固件包。包含的固件将在检测到需求时默认启用。然而，它也将包括让用户在启动时禁用的方法。（截止本文发表时的提案支持人数：17）\n\r\n提案 B：不改变原有的镜像集，保留原来的不包含非自由固件的镜像，另外单独提供包含非自由固件的官方镜像。新的镜像下载链接将更醒目以方便新用户找到它们，而原来的镜像的视觉优先级将变低。（截止本文发表时的提案支持人数：10）\n\r\n提案 C：和提案 B 类似，在用户下载不包含自由固件的镜像时，提醒他们还有包含非自由固件的镜像可供下载。（截止本文发表时的提案支持人数：6）\n\r\n提案 D：继续遵守《Debian 社会契约Debian Social Contract》第 1 节和第 5 节的精神，继续保持现状，不在 Debian 中包含任何非自由软件，但支持它们的使用，并欢迎其他人分发这样的作品。（截止本文发表时的提案支持人数：6）\n\r\n\r\n这些是一些有趣的建议。我认为提案 A 对所有人都很方便，同时给高级用户禁用非自由固件的机会。\n\r\n你可以在 官方网页 中了解更多关于一般决议的信息。\n\r\n你怎么看？\n\r\n将非自由固件纳入官方发行版中\n\r\n至于目前的情况，你可以找到带有非自由固件的“非官方”的 Debian 镜像。\n\r\n然而，并不是每个用户都知道它，即使它在 Debian 的下载页面上被宣传，“非官方”的说法也不会让用户比推荐的镜像更喜欢。\n\r\n此外，当用户可以选择任何基于 Ubuntu 的发行版或 Ubuntu 作为替代品时，期望他们安装非自由固件是违反直觉的。\n\r\n不仅仅限于这些问题，Steve 在他的 博客 中还提到了其他一些问题，包括：\n\r\n\r\n维护独立的非自由镜像是很耗时的。\n\r\n由于缺乏非自由固件，许多用户不喜欢官方镜像。\n\r\n\r\n那么，你认为 Debian 的一般决议的投票结果是什么？一个单独的介质镜像？还是把它包括在官方镜像中？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/debian-non-free/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lkxed 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Debian 修改了 Chromium 的默认搜索引擎\n\r\n虽然 Firefox 仍然是 Debian 的默认浏览器，但很多 Linux 用户都会安装 Chrome 浏览器的开源上游 Chromium 浏览器。早些时候，在 Debian 中提供的 Chromium 使用谷歌作为默认搜索引擎。最近，Debian 发布公告称，“由于隐私原因，将默认搜索引擎改为 DuckDuckGo”。这个决定并不是匆忙做出的，因为这个提议是在两年前提出的，只是近日才得以通过。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：It's foss\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看来开源爱好者们越来越厌弃谷歌了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n法国用 AI 发现未申报的私人游泳池，开出千万欧元账单\n\r\n因为建造游泳池能提高房价，意味着更高的财产税，根据法国法律，业主需要申报其建造的游泳池。2020 年法国有逾 320 万个私人游泳池，新冠疫情期间愈来愈多的人在家办公，游泳池的安装量也进一步激增。法国税务部门使用由谷歌等公司开发的 AI 软件，可以在航拍图像上识别游泳池，并与土地登记数据库进行交叉检查。结果发现了超过 2 万个未申报的私人游泳池，这些业主将收到总额约为 1000 万欧元的账单。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：BBC\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这就是 AI 的生财之道，早晚有一天，AI 会把人拿捏的死死的。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nWeb3 DNS 供应商可能失去其域名\n\r\nENS 是一种运行在以太坊上的域名服务，用于在 Web3 中便捷地访问各种地址。但是如果想在互联网上访问它，通常需要一种特别的 DNS 服务商，其中 eth.link 是使用最多的一个。但是，该域名的所有者因故入狱，因此这个域名没有办法续费，面临过期。eth.link 于 7 月 26 日到期，并将于 9 月 5 日被域名注册商收回，届时它将可能被抢注并用于恶意用途。在试图由其他人替代续费，而被域名注册商拒绝之后，ENS DAO 已经建议用户使用另外一个 eth.limo 域名作为替代。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Coindesk\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这就很不 Web3，一个常用的服务依赖于某个具体的人。事实上，现在以“去中心化”为目标的的 Web3 的基础设施，几乎都是由中心化的人或组织控制的。",

          "description": "刚接触效率软件的朋友，经常会被两类软件弄混淆：\n一类是清单/待办/Todo类软件，比如知名的滴答清单、极简待办、Reminder（苹果系统自带的提醒事项）、Microsoft to do、Things3、Sorted3、Todoist等等。\n一类是日历类软件，比如苹果手机、华为手机系统自带的日历app，还有一些第三方的日历软件，比如Fantastical、Busycal、Google日历、Calendars等等。\n这两类都能可以记录待办事项，进行时间上的规划，比如它们都能实现像「周三出差」、「5月3日购物」这样的日程提醒，但是二者又有很多不同之处，比如界面上的差异、使用方法上的差异等等。如果用更专业的术语来形容，这两类软件的目标也有显著的差别，前者主要进行任务（Tasks）管理，后者主要进行日程或时间（Time）管理，侧重点是不一样的。\n这篇文章会从新手角度，聊一聊如何开启一段效率之旅。文章讲的内容比较浅显，一部分来自我这两年的探索，另一部分来自少数派友的分享。推荐大家读一读 @闲者时间_王掌柜君的文章（注意搜索之后选择「不限时间」，否则很容易错过早先的好文章），这篇文章也受到王掌柜 《术与道-聊聊我的时间管理》 这篇文章的启发，推荐大家阅读。\n概念梳理\n待办清单：侧重任务管理\n第一类待办软件，顾名思义，就是以处理等待办理的事情，核心功能落在要做的「事件」上。\n这类软件最简单的使用方法，就是在Inbox（收件箱）里输入一件待办事项。比如你想约几个老友抽空聚餐，只要在收件箱里记下这几个字，无需更多设置，等到你打开软件，看到这句话，就会起到提醒的作用。\n如果你想要把这件事情规划得更详细，也可以为它设置各种属性，比如确定时间（约好在下周三晚8点），也可以预设提醒（前一天21:00提醒你，以提前安排出行），还可以设置标签（放到 #生活 这个标签下）、优先级（高，毕竟老朋友难得聚一次…",

          "description": "在 WWDC22 上，Apple 发布 iOS 16 的时候，公布了一个功能叫实时活动，并向开发者开放 Live Activities API。\n\n那么什么实时活动呢？\n实时活动是一种新的交互式消息通知，用户可以在 iPhone 的锁屏界面看到事件的实时更新。比如球赛的比分、打车或订餐的订单状态、运动锻炼的实时数据等。这种消息通知形式允许开发者在实时活动期间更新单个交互式通知，而不是每次有状态更新时都发送新通知。通过减少发送的通知数量，同时使信息更易于访问。\nUber海外版团队设计的实时活动界面\nApple 在 iOS 16 开发者测试版 Beta 4 首次向开发者提供 ActivityKit 开发套件，首次在真机实装，随后在 Beta 6 和 Beta 7 并没有在真机实装实时活动功能。开发者目前只能在模拟器测试这项功能，或者降级回 Beta 4 或 Beta 5。Apple 在开发者网站也明确表示实时活动不会在首个 iOS16 正式版推出，而是在今年晚些时候的正式版突出。下图是模仿目前已有的原神安卓小组件、iOS 小组件做的实时活动版小组件。到了 8 月 16 日一大早用手机更新 Beta 6 之后，手机就不能运行和测试实时活动了，随后也看到其他开发者反馈实时活动在 Beta 6 版本没有实装。本文后面的截图只能在模拟器截取了，但模拟器不能更改壁纸，只有黑色背景。\nXcode真机调试报错ActivityKit没实装\n实时活动界面部分是小组件扩展，开发者使用 WidgetKit 功能和 SwiftUI 编写界面布局，ActivityKit 是处理配置、启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动是一种消息通知，是一种可以自定义界面布局和更新状态的消息通知。下图是普通类型的消息通知，或许以后能看到换了界面布局的降雨提醒。\n普通的消息通知类型\n实时活动要求和限制\n与小组件不同的是，小组件是通过时间线机制更新界面数据，实时活动是通过远程推送或 ActivityKit 从主应用程序来启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动无法访问网络或接收位置更新，下图网络请求图片失败。\n\nActivityKit 更新和远程推送通知更新的更新动态数据大小不能超过 4KB。\n实时活动界面不能包含可交互元素，例如按钮和 WebView。当用户点击实时活动界面，将会打开主应用程序。\n自定义实时活动的用户界面时，系统会忽略任何自定义动画，但可以使用系统自带的时间文本动画，当实时活动的动态内容发生变化时，系统会执行一些动画。文本视图通过模糊的内容过渡动画内容变化，系统为图像和 SF Symbols 符号动画内容过渡，根据内容或状态更改从用户界面添加或删除视图，视图会淡入淡出。\n系统自带的时间文本动画系统为图像内容变化作出的动画效果\n在开发者网站的描述中，如果实时活动的高度超过 160，系统可能会截断它。在实际测试中，实时活动界面最小高度为 64，最大高度可以达到 220。目前实时活动功能还不是正式的版本，有可能在之后的测试版本会有改变。\n\n当用户在 App 首次启动时，点击允许应用程序发送通知时，就代表允许 App 发送实时活动通知，不允许则不会收到实时活动的通知。之后在系统设置 - 对应的 App -实时活动，可以关闭/开启实时活动权限。\n实时活动权限位置\n实时活动有 4 种活动状态，分别是：等待中、正在进行、成功、失败\n实时活动在锁屏界面显示的时候，用户可以左划，点击清除按钮将其清除。用户没有清除的情况下，实时活动最多可以处于活动状态 8 小时，如果用户或应用程序尚未结束活动状态，系统会自动结束它。在此结束状态下，实时活动会在锁定屏幕上最多保留 4 个小时，最后系统会将其删除。\n\n目前实时活动功能还在测试状态，开发者们还在为他们的 App 设计和测试这一项功能，下图是收集几款目前在测试中的实时活动的例子。\n一些例子展示\n关于实时活动这一功能的一些设想。在这个功能正式上线后，除了官方和大部分媒体提到的比赛比分、运动训练状态、行程状态、订单状态等这些功能以外，我们或许还可以看到这些功能：某餐饮 App 提醒你周四中午吃啥；原神体力、宝钱、参量质变仪到点提示上线领取；购物平台推送提醒商品抢购即将开启、正在抢购还剩余 69 件并且在不断减少等之类的功能。\n\n以上就是关于实时活动这个功能的一些介绍和想法。之前的一篇锁屏天气的文章和视频会有评论说解锁在桌面小组件就能看到天气了啊，左划负一屏添加小组件就能看到天气了啊。不过对于我这种手机懒得解锁的用户来说，对于锁屏实时活动这个功能是非常期待的。大家对于实时活动这个系统特性及功能有什么想法和期待呢？",

          "description": "Outside of 3D, curved TVs are probably one of the industry’s most ill-advised gimmicks. Unless you sat at a very specific point in front of them, they resulted in a warped image, harsh reflections, and a generally unpleasant viewing experience, for close to no benefit. Seriously, they were terrible. It felt like curved TVs happened because companies could make them, rather than because they should.\nIt took me a little while to realize it, but LG’s new 42-inch OLED Flex, which it’s announced this week at IFA and hopes to bring to market this fall, effectively marks the return of curved TVs. It may have a monitor-style stand featuring some gamer-styled RGB lighting, and LG may have confused things slightly by placing the OLED Flex on top...\nContinue reading…",

T-Mobile execs promised then that the merger was “all about creating new, high-quality, high-paying jobs, and the new T-Mobile will be jobs-positive from Day One and every day thereafter.”  \nIn April 2020, the companies had about 80,000 workers combined; however, as the Journal points out, T-Mobile’s most recent annual report (pdf) said it ended 2021 with 75,000 full- and part-time employees.\nEmployees \nAs of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 75,000 full-time and...\nContinue reading…",

The first was the price. At $2,499.95, it rivaled the cost of many traditional surround sound systems comprised of AV receivers and multiple speakers. But perhaps more important was its size. I say this with love, but the original Ambeo Soundbar (which has now been renamed the Ambeo Soundbar Max) was a chunky boy, which hardly made it an easy sell for anyone looking to tuck it discreetly in front of their TV. \nSo although it’s $1,000 cheaper, I think price might only be the second most important change with Sennheiser’s second soundbar, the $1,499.95 Ambeo Soundbar Plus, which the company launched today at an event in Berlin.

Ceeyalord): We found out that many of our users want to promote and endorse each other and are sharing other people’s Ceeya pages on their own. We’d like to turn this behavior into a built-in feature so that it’s much easier to offer or ask others to share yours. We believe this will be a great way to increase visibility and lead generation. Who knows? If your page receives a lot of clicks and engagement, you may even sell a slot on your page, becoming a landlord 💸… I mean Ceeyalord :)\n\n🃏More cards: We’re receiving a lot of feature requests to build different types of cards, like a digital download, video/photo sharing, blog entry, or even Pokemon cards (🤯duh?). One of our favorite requests is a secret card where its contents can only be opened with a passcode. The imagination is limitless. We will build more types of cards going forward for sure. At the same time, we can’t do it alone. At some point, we will open up our SDK so that other developers can build any types of cards they want to offer to our users.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

It gets you up and running with fully reproducible training environments with near zero config.\n\nThe inspiration for Unweave, and the tagline, came from the countless hours spent spinning up EC2 instances, managing S3 buckets, tweaking config files and writing heaps of boilerplate code just to get some extra processing power and storage capacity.\nIt led us to ask ourselves: what if you could keep that gleamingly smooth Macbook Pro user experience but bundle it with infinite storage and computing capacity?\n\nThat’s what we’ve set out to build with Unweave.\n\nUnweave works in one simple way: if you run `unweave python train.py` instead of `python train.py`, it automatically builds and runs your environment in the cloud, within seconds, while versioning everything you run end-to-end.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
