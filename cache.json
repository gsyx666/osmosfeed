          "description": "I find it difficult to deny the benefits of modern IDEs on software development. They've made it easier for us to write code, reducing cognitive load and automating boring tasks, sparing us precious time to be employed on more important activities.\nWhat about NPM or crates.io? Sure they make our lives easier by allowing us to download the right dependencies on-the-fly, but what if we are cut off from the internet? It could be just a short blackout, a temporary problem caused by severe weather or some days spent on the wilderness (some of us would love coding there too). It could also be something worse, say a political crisis or even war. Anyway, whatever the cause is, are we ready to code without internet access?\nI can't shake off my head the idea that being without internet is something of the past. It would seem that we walk towards an always connected world. Think Starlink.\nOn the other hand, what if Enterprise's computer fails? What do we do without our beloved tricorders and databases? Do we have to relearn how to suture by hand?\nMore than modern IDEs, the availability and possibility to exchange source code (and download it) from the Cloud made coding extremely easier and quicker.\nBut what if there is no cloud to download from anymore? What if we are cut off the internet? What if the infrastructure we depended upon is no more? \nIs it possible to prepare for such an occurrence? \nI finish this post by pointing you to devdocs.io. Among all these modern tools - IDEs, search engines, social media -, it made me think that even though we've grown a little too much dependent on modern day connectedness, it is still possible to live without Google or StackOverflow!\nPS.: And yes, it is possible to create a local NPM server and I've heard of something similar for crates.io. That's one of my goals in the near future. =]",

However, not just that, this week I also learned more interesting features that GitHub has to offer: using tracking branches and testing via remotes. Even though I have been using GitHub for about a year now, I had no idea about tracking branches and remotes. This was very interesting but something that also took me a little while to develop the muscle memory to type out intuitively. \nThis week there were a lot of collaborative efforts between me and my lab partner.

          "description": "微软、谷歌、亚马逊、IBM 和甲骨文如今都在关注云上的 DevOps。这些大公司正在给企业提供 IT 自动化的服务。然而，DevOps 仍然在持续的演进中。DevSecOps、AIOps 和 NoOps 正在成为下一个流行词。\n\r\n\r\n随着开发和管理人员看到及时交付高质量软件的商业价值，敏捷Agile方法论和 DevOps 也变得流行起来。拥有灵活的发布周期，并且交付具有可扩展scalable和可定制customizable的软件，是世界上每个企业的目标。通过将 CI/CD 工具和管道pipeline部署到云端，DevOps 使发布过程变得更加流畅。融合了 DevOps 的 Polyglot 微服务架构正在帮助企业降低总拥有成本（TCO）。他们现在有能力用渐进式网络应用程序和最新的 UI 框架升级他们的技术栈。总的来说，团队正在以更好的效率执行任务，并且正在开发高质量的软件模块。\n\r\n自治 DevOps\n\r\n容器和 DevOps 与云原生应用走到了一起。Kubernetes 和 Docker 正在被用作容器，一个新的名词 NoOps 现在正在流行。对于不同的容器，编排Orchestration都是一个重要的功能。为了扩展应用，开发环境中要创建容器集群。有一些新的容器正在进入云原生应用这个领域，比如 Mesos、Swarm、Openshift Rancher 和 Nomad。NoOps 有助于缩短编码周期，从而监控和管理应用程序。缺陷修复和热修复是不同的活动，它们都是 NoOps 的一部分。NoOps 有助于提高技术团队和业务运营人员之间的协同作用。它也有助于更好的监控、管理和流程自动化。NoOps 基础设施能够控制应用程序在云上的部署。企业从中获得的好处包括更好的交付、弹性的服务、更快的发布、良好的质量和 CI/CD 自动化。\n\r\nDevSecOps\n\r\nDevSecOps 算是另一个流行趋势，它与在开发操作中的安全问题有关。最近与漏洞vulnerabilities（log4j），安全泄露security breach（谷歌、脸书、微软），和安全攻击相关的问题增加了 DevSecOps 在企业中的重要性。左移shift left方法强调了在软件生命周期的早期处理安全性和质量的重要性。在架构阶段就需要考虑隐私和遵从性compliances（如 GDPR）。这有助于降低成本，并且提升软件交付的速度。审计工具和安全检查列表是 DevOps 工具和系统的一部分，现在我们称为 DevSecOps。\n\r\nAIOps\n\r\nAI DevOps 现在被称为 AIOps。据预测，将来 AI 应用会由 AIOps 来管理。与 AIOps 相关的工具和软件正在开发中，并且将很快发布首个版本。AI/ML 应用部署和模型更新可以由 AIOps 来处理。这将在工业 4.0Industry 4.0 以及数据科学中扮演重要角色。有一种观点认为，NoOps 将会是 AIOps 的最终形态。AIOps 包括数据集管理、模型训练、模型服务、元数据管理、模型更新和服务更新。分布式训练将由 AIOps 来完成，这会提供超参数hyper parameter优化，工作流程管理和“假设what if”的分析能力。\n\r\n微服务配置管理\n\r\n当前，DevOps 和微服务正在成为标准部署和架构蓝图architectural blueprints来实施。应用可以在模块级别上就进行扩展。微服务可以在简化缺陷修复和问题区域隔离上提供帮助。经过设计，微服务可以通过添加更多计算能力computing power的实例instances来进行扩展。但是当它们没有被正确实现的时候，数据安全和管理的问题就会突然出现。\n\r\n平台即产品\n\r\n云上的软件即服务Software as a Service和平台即产品Platform as a Product最近非常流行。通过加速向平台部署和功能交付，DevOps 使这些变成现实。从编码到上线阶段，CI/CD 管道有助于可视化应用的部署。持续交付、集成和部署都是 DevOps 的一部分。DevOps 生产线模拟工业生产线是未来要关注的。\n\r\nDevOps 正在慢慢地向 DevSecOps 和 AIOps 转变。对于企业，NoOps 才是未来。现在需要的是减少与安全相关的攻击、事故和破坏发生。对于企业来说，数据安全和隐私的优先级更高，并且这些新技术都将在这方面有所帮助。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/09/where-is-devops-headed/\n\r\n作者：Bhagvan Kommadi 选题：lkxed 译者：Yufei-Yan 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Fedora 37（和 36）可能不再允许你使用一些流行的编解码器来方便地使用视频的图形加速功能。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nFedora 是一个流行的 Linux 发行版，迎合了那些希望在他们的工作站（和服务器）上使用最先进技术的用户。\n\r\n它没有搭载任何专有组件，默认情况下坚持使用完全开源的软件库。\n\r\n虽然这对一些人来说已经很不方便了，但现在看来，另一个变化可能会困扰期待 Fedora 37 的用户。\n\r\n最近在 Fedora 上的一个 Mesa 的提交 告诉我们，由于法律问题，H.264、H.265 和 VC-1 编解码器的视频加速 API（VAAPI）的支持已经被禁用。\n\r\n这一变化可能也会被回传到 Fedora 36。\n\r\n\r\n💡 H.264 是大多数视频行业使用的主流视频编解码器。\n\r\n例如，苹果公司广泛使用 H.264 编解码器，用于 iPhone 手机拍摄的照片和视频。你可以阅读此 文档 来了解更多。\n\r\n\r\nFedora 项目论坛的一位成员 首先发现 了 Fedora 中的这一变化，他将其描述为 “F36 的一大退步”。\n\r\n这对 Fedora 用户来说是坏消息吗？\n\r\n是的，基本上是的。\n\r\n主要是，它将影响使用开源驱动程序的 AMD GPU 用户，阻止他们使用 GPU 加速 来播放需要使用这些编解码器的视频内容。\n\r\n此外，它还会影响到 任何使用开源图形驱动的用户，即使他们在英特尔芯片上运行 iGPU。Fedora 开发者还没有对此提供任何澄清，但你可以自己测试一下。\n\r\n如果你在英伟达显卡上使用专有驱动程序，你就没有什么可担心的。\n\r\n运行旧硬件的用户也可能有问题，他们的系统可能不支持这些编解码器。\n\r\n这些编解码器最常用在你从 BT 或各种服务中下载的视频中，这些视频还没有转移到更新一代的编解码器（如 AV1 和 VP9）。\n\r\n我相信，这是互联网上的大部分视频的情况。\n\r\n一些流媒体平台也使用这些编解码器在其各自的平台上提供内容，这可能导致用户在试图通过其服务访问内容时面临问题。\n\r\n这是否影响到每个人？\n\r\n如果你是那些观看 YouTube 视频的人，不使用任何需要这些编解码器的视频的平台或下载它们，你就不会有任何问题。\n\r\nFedora 正在避免法律上的麻烦\n\r\n还没有人起诉 Fedora 或强迫他们这样做。然而，正如 Phoronix 所指出的，Mesa 的一个变化最近允许开发者选择性地禁用编解码器，以帮助避免法律纠纷和软件专利冲突。\n\r\n因此，为了避免法律上的混乱，Fedora 进行了这一改变。\n\r\nH.264 和 H.265 的专利属于一家名为 MPEG LA 的公司，该公司专门用于持有视频编解码器和显示标准领域的专利。\n\r\n而 VC-1 的专利属于 SMPTE，这是一个由媒体和娱乐机构的专业人士管理的团体。\n\r\n考虑到用户在购买显卡时已经支付了使用这些编解码器的许可，我们仍然不确定为什么会这样。你可以在 Fedora 的法律列表会话 中阅读更多相关信息。\n\r\n可能的解决方法是什么？\n\r\n显然，你必须依赖基于 CPU 的解码了。当然，你也可以使用官方或第三方的 Mesa 构建版本。\n\r\nFlatpak 应用程序可能允许你观看图形加速的视频内容而没有问题。但是，这要取决于软件的维护者。\n\r\n但是，对于大多数用户来说，这可能是一个不方便的解决方案。\n\r\n另一个解决方法可能是在旨在包含第三方应用程序的 RPM Fusion 仓库中单独包含支持 VAAPI 的编解码器。\n\r\n然而，负责 Fedora RPM Fusion 仓库的开发者对维护 Fedora Mesa 3D 的复刻版本不感兴趣。该开发者提到：\n\r\n\r\nrpmfusion 基本上没有兴趣去打包和维护它，而且保持仓库与 Fedora 同步对我来说也不是一个优先事项。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n💬 你对 Fedora 的这一变化有什么看法？请在下面的评论中告诉我们你的想法。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/fedora-drops-vaapi-codec/\n\r\n作者：Sourav Rudra 选题：lkxed 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "前言\n为了在上班前再抓紧时间享受一下旅行的快乐，我和女朋友一起去了一趟杭州和绍兴。十年前，我和父母曾经去过一次杭州和苏州，但那时正值盛夏，酷暑难耐，我的父亲出行时又是出了名的紧张和暴躁，导致少了不少游玩的乐趣，杭州在我心目中也并没有留下什么深刻的印象。在一位杭州「土著」同学的怂恿下，为了帮助杭州洗刷这个对她并不公平的心理评价，我决定再来一次杭州。\n按照这位同学说，我们这一次来得正是时候，赶上了杭州为期两周的秋天，早来了太热，晚来了太冷。\n她是没错的。九月底的杭州真的是——好舒服啊！\n除了正午那几个小时，杭州的天气这几天一直稳定在很适宜的温度，在室内和室外几乎没有温差。哪怕是上午快十二点，大晴天走在大街上也只是有丝丝暖意，如果这时候有几阵微风从西湖吹来，送上岸边荷叶清新的香气和清凉，我就会情不自禁地把手臂张开，闭上眼睛，好好感受这让人舒服得跺脚的惬意。\n因为我们这一次以休闲游为主，并没有安排很满的行程，这几天都是睡到自然醒，吃完饭中午才出门，所以行程上也安排得不是很有效率。作为一个旅行攻略太过勉强，但也确确实实享受到了放空身心的那种悠闲和惬意。\n灵隐寺\n食\n很惭愧，这一次是摆烂的行程。因为不想时间太紧张，所以并没有专门搜一些当地人才会去的苍蝇馆子，吃的都是比较常见的连锁餐厅，外婆家、新白鹿、绿茶。我这个外地人尝不出地不地道，但坐着挺舒适，味道也挺好的。我特别喜欢西湖天地那家外婆家，旁边就是西湖，吃完饭去消消食也是一流的。\n第一天晚上杭州的同学带我们去银泰附近吃了一家名为杭州酒家的餐厅。据说已经有一百年历史了。叫花鸡被一层壳包裹，需要客人颇具仪式感地亲自敲几下，而后师傅再帮忙敲开，鸡肉已经酥软无比，香味甚至渗进了骨头；熏鱼比我想象中的多汁，带着一种甜甜的味道；藕粉样子很好看，但感觉味道稍淡了些，响铃沾了不同的酱料味道很丰富。\n叫化鸡响铃\n住\n这次我们选择了在湖滨步行街附近的一家…",

          "description": "在正式开始教程之前首先说明一下目前国行系统的状态：最新版三星云（5.2.00.5）屏蔽了OneDrive备份的入口，直接删除了相关备份软件的服务。因此要在国行系统机器上继续使用OneDrive备份需要降级三星云。如果对Samsung Pay没有需求而对同步有比较大的需求，最简单的方法是刷港版系统。本教程基于One UI 4.1，国行S20。所有需要的安装包均可在教程链接或者apkmirror网站上找到。\n在开始之前需要的准备：一个非大陆地区的三星账号，一个微软账号（需要是个人账号），一个非国行系统的三星手机（也可以是你的国行设备刷港版系统），以及一部国行系统的三星手机（操作对象）。\n第一步，绑定三星账号和微软账户。\n在非国行系统的手机上登录三星账号，然后在相册的设置里，找到云同步，点击按照提示登录微软账户。其中某些步骤容易因为网络原因卡住，不过由于我从来没遇到过，所以有需求的建议在酷安上搜索相关资料，或者全程科学网络。这一步很简单，因此不做过多阐述。\n第二步，降级三星云。\n一般来说，国行系统的三星云会被强制自动更新，因此要想使用备份需要先降级三星云。\n目前在apkmirror上找到能安装也能备份的最新版是5.1.00.13，由于版本号相比国行最新版三星云5.1.05.9更低，需要重新安装。可以现在系统里卸载三星云，再安装此版本的三星云。如果不想重新同步之前的云数据，可以使用ADB直接降级安装。代码我放在下面（为了方便输入，包名我改成了123.apk）\nadb install -r -d D:\\123.apk\n第三步，在国行设备上进行后续操作。\n登录账号之后，下载一个OneDrive，登录之前和三星账户绑定的那个微软账户。登录成功之后就可以暂时忽略这个软件。然后按照链接里的方法在手机上安装lycan，这一步是关键，否则之后的操作都无法进行。\nhttps://www.coolapk.com/feed/32708070?shareKey=YWUwNDI3ZTU5Y2FmNjMzMTVlN2M~&shareUid=964712&shareFrom=com.coolapk.app_5.0.2\n下载「创建快捷方式」这个软件\n【创建快捷方式】 ，打开之后右上角三个点勾选「也显示系统应用」，搜索三星云。点击进入三星云的活动列表，搜索「dashboard」，找到图中这个活动，然后创建一个快捷方式放在桌面。\n\n如果此时打开这个快捷方式，会进入OneDrive同步的那个页面，但是会提示三星云需要更新才能同步，如果不更新就会强制退出。所以我们需要用到lycan屏蔽这个更新提示。\n打开lycan，搜索三星云，在「服务」中将uploadtodrive两项设置成enable\n\n在「接收器」中将下图三项禁用，三项名字均带有update\n\n在「服务」中打开下图两项\n\n此时重新打开刚刚那个快捷方式，就能够正常同步了。\n成功效果如图\n\n如果之后打开三星云又提示更新，可以按照之前的方法降级三星云。不排除之后的系统更新会屏蔽这个接口的可能，只能说且用且珍惜。",

          "description": "时间切片 Time Slice 是延时摄影的静态表现形式：你通过固定机位并在特定的时间间隔内拍摄一系列照片，得到一组静态照片，然后在后期的时候按照时间顺序，取每一张照片的局部，然后拼接起来，便得到一个名为时间切片的照片。\n2022 年 7 月份在梧桐山顶拍摄了一组日落时分的延时照片，并在后期导入电脑并使用 DaVinci Resolve 合成延时视频的时候，我突然想起一个朋友在 2013 年输出的一个时间切片照片。于是也想给我这组照片制作一个时间切片。\n后期制作时间切片是一道很复杂的工程（比如，可以参考这里），随着照片数目的增多，操作步骤会越多。在正式使用 Photoshop 尝试制作时间切片之前，我就直接有个想法，要不自己实现一把？\n事实上，使用程序来实现一点都不难：给一组照片排好序后，在一个大的画布上，依次取该照片特定的区域，然后绘制到该画布的同样的区域就能实现这种效果。最开始我是在 Android 上进行这块的测试，后来很快就完成并验证了效果的可用性。后来想了下，MyerTidy 虽然目前的功能只有「整理文件」，但它实际上是可以定位为一个「批量处理」的 app。\n最后便有了 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新（暂时只有 macOS 版本）。\n此版本带来以下的变化：\n\n重新设计的带响应式布局的首页，为未来支持更多批量操作进行前置的支持\n新增各个模式的功能介绍以及效果图\n支持「延时切片」功能，正如上文所说的，可以为你制作时间切片照片。在下文会做更详细的介绍\n进行了小部分重构和性能优化\n\n在首页选择了「延时切片」后，你便可以选择一个文件夹或者一组照片了，之后会自动进行预览渲染：\n\n \n默认的效果是，根据你的文件名升序排序，从左到右，不对图片进行采样来进行绘制。\n比如你有文件名为 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg 到 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg 的 100 张图片，会使用以下顺序从左到右来绘制：\n\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_002.jpg\n…\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg\n\n效果如上。\n \n你可以点击「倒序处理」，来使用倒序的方式来从左到右绘制：\n\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_099.jpg\n…\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg\n\n效果如下：\n\n \n如果你觉得你的图片太多了，想以固定的间隔来取一部分来绘制，那么可以在「跳过合成的数目」来输入你要跳过的数目 X。也就是，每隔 X 张，只会取一张来绘制。\n\n跳过的数目为 5 的情况下，每 5 张会选择第一张来绘制。\n对于上述图片，跳过数目设定为 50 的时候（原图片总数目为 654 张）效果如下：\n\n \n最后，上述的布局方式都是「水平布局」：图片以水平方向来进行绘制。\n你可以点击「垂直布局」，来开启从上到下的绘制模式，效果如下：\n\n此外特别注意的一点是，MyerTidy 目前不支持图片自动对齐。因此如果你的图片组因为前期拍摄的原因有部分图片对不齐，那么需要你先使用 Photoshop 等工具来前期做对齐（当然，相比做时间切片来说，应该不算太困难）。如果需求强烈，那么可能会调研并加入这块的支持。\n以上便是 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新。未来会专注 macOS 下对文件和图片的「批处理」的实现，目前期望会做的下一个大功能便是对文件按照特定的规则批量重命名（比如整理番剧之类的，会很有用），也在思考是否可以加入类似「星轨合成」这样的功能。\n你可以通过 App Store 搜索 MyerTidy 来进行下载。如果你有什么想法和反馈，欢迎留言。",
