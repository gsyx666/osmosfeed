For this, we must first add a components folder to our project.\nlayout.js.\nLet's start with some hardcoded layout elements, and we'll move them to our components later.\nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <header>Header</header>\n      <main>{children}</main>\n      <footer>&copy; 2022 - Our portfolio</footer>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nAs you can see, a layout is technically simply a component that renders some other elements.\n\"children\", which is whatever we put inside of it.\nTo use this layout, we need to load it from our _app.js file.\nIt will return whatever we throw at it by default, but we can wrap that into this layout.\nimport '../styles/globals.css';\nimport Layout from '../components/layout';\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default MyApp;\n\nAs you can see, the component element is now wrapped in our layout, so the Component will become the children part as defined there.\nYou can now run your project to see it in action. The page should now have the header and footer.\n\nIf you want to see the code for today, I uploaded it to GitHub.\nThank you for reading my blog.

          "description": "Version 2.11 of Foal is out! Here are the improvements that it brings:\nThe PBKDF2 algorithm (used for password hashing) uses a number of iterations to hash passwords. This work factor is deliberate and slows down potential attackers, making attacks against hashed passwords more difficult.\nAs computing power increases, the number of iterations must also increase. This is why, starting with version 2.11, the number of iterations has been increased to 310,000.\nTo check that an existing password hash is using the latest recommended number of iterations, you can use the passwordHashNeedsToBeRefreshed function.\nThe example below shows how to perform this check during a login and how to upgrade the password hash if the number of iterations turns out to be too low.\nconst { email, password } = ctx.request.body;\n\nconst user = await User.findOne({ email });\n\nif (!user) {\n  return new HttpResponseUnauthorized();\n}\n\nif (!await verifyPassword(password, user.password)) {\n  return new HttpResponseUnauthorized();\n}\n\n// highlight-start\n// This line must be after the password verification.\nif (passwordHashNeedsToBeRefreshed(user.password)) {\n  user.password = await hashPassword(password);\n  await user.save();\n}\n// highlight-end\n\n// Log the user in.",

          "description": "开源代码可能是当今大多数公司最可行的选择，但它也伴随着自己的问题。\n\r\n\r\n许多人支持使用 开源软件open source software（OSS）。毕竟，我们为什么要不断地尝试构建代码来解决别人已经解决过的问题？为什么不分享信息并逐步和迭代地增强当前的开源解决方案呢？这些平等主义价值观egalitarian values，可能是整个文明的根本，更不用说软件了，但还是包含了几千年来一直存在的冲突。\n\r\n开源软件安全的问题在于，尽管任何人都可以查看源代码，但这并不意味着他们会这么做。有一些广泛使用的开源项目仅由数量有限的工程师维护。这些工程师无法完全自愿地提供时间和精力，因为他们也需要支付他们的账单。\n\r\n即使对于更复杂的开源项目，这也是一个问题。举个例子，Linux 内核项目由 3000 多万行代码组成，包含数百个需要解决的缺陷，并有近 2000 名活跃的开发者。每个活跃的开发者都写了超过 15000 行的代码。\n\r\n根据 Linux 基金会最近的一项研究，一个应用程序平均有 5.1 个重大漏洞仍未解决，41% 的企业对其开源软件的安全性缺乏信心。而更糟糕的是，只有 49% 的企业拥有开源安全策略。\n\r\n即使开源软件有安全漏洞，这也不能保证它能被修复。调查显示，目前修复一个漏洞平均需要 97.8 天，使使用该软件的企业在几个月内容易受到攻击。这就是开源软件安全有时被忽视的地方：就像好人可以寻找代码中的错误和漏洞来修复它们一样，坏人也可以寻找同样的漏洞来利用它们。\n\r\n仅仅依靠志愿者社区来发现漏洞、报告漏洞和修复漏洞是一个漫长的过程。在你继续受益于开源的广泛优势的同时，花钱请人检查你的开源解决方案的安全性可以帮助弥补这个问题。\n\r\n由于必须部署开源软件的更新和补丁以保证系统的安全，这一要求会带来独特的困难。如果你的解决方案依赖于某个软件版本，更新你的关键任务软件可能会导致功能损失和/或计划外的停机。当情况对业务至关重要时，聘请专家来回传补丁并维护一个时间更长的版本可能比让大型社区愿意去做更加优雅。\n\r\n开源社区经常使用的一句话是：“这是开源的，去改变它吧！”它强调了一个关键点：当别人在项目中投入时间、精力或金钱的时候，期望白白得到良好的安全水平是不合理的，也是不可持续的。\n\r\n要么按原定计划为开源做出贡献，改进代码并为他人发布，要么聘请专业人士管理开源代码并在必要时进行调试，这些都是选择。然而，这个行业无法承担完全不做贡献。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/10/security-issues-with-open-source-in-todays-world/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：KevinZonda 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "为英伟达显卡开发的一个全新的开源驱动正在开发中！这里有一些好的进展……\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nNVK 是一个全新的用于英伟达显卡的开源 Vulkan 驱动，它的目标是成为新的主流显卡驱动。\n\r\n这成为可能的部分原因是因为英伟达开源了数据中心 GPU 和消费级 GPU（GTX/RTX）的 GPU 内核模块。\n\r\n\r\n英伟达在改善其 GPU 在 Linux 上的体验方面迈出了重要的一步\n\r\n\r\n它使开发人员能够改进开源驱动程序并启用比以前更多的功能。\n\r\n让我们来看看 NVK 可以提供什么。\n\r\n新的适用于英伟达 GPU 的 NVK 开源驱动程序\n\r\nJason Ekstrand（Collabora 的工程师）和 Red Hat 的其他人已经在过去几个月里编写了 NVK 的代码。\n\r\n他们可以利用 Turing 系列显卡提供的统一固件 BLOB，然后在其上构建 Vulkan 支持。\n\r\n但是，不是已经有了 nouveau 开源驱动程序了吗？\n\r\nNVK 与其他的 nouveau 驱动非常不同，因为它是从头开始编写的。\n\r\nnouveau 是一个主要的英伟达显卡的开源驱动程序，已经年久失修了，试图在它的基础上构建是一个很多人都无法承担的任务。\n\r\n当然，它是由有很多才华的工程师开发的，但是缺乏公司的支持和贡献者的影响了它的发展。\n\r\nNVK 旨在克服这些问题，同时专注于对 Turing 系列及更高版本 GPU 的支持。\n\r\n由于内核的开发方式，对于 Kepler、Maxwell 和 Pascal 等较旧的 GPU 的支持可能不会很容易地加入 NVK。它也许极大地依赖于新内核，从而只支持较新的 GPU。\n\r\n同时，nouveau 内核接口与 Vulkan 不兼容，阻碍了对较旧 GPU 的支持。\n\r\n但是，仍然有进一步测试的空间，这可能会让 NVK 可以支持较旧的 GPU。\n\r\n当然，随着更多的社区贡献，NVK 可以通过增加额外的功能和 GPU 支持来改进。\n\r\n如何尝试它？\n\r\nNVK 目前处于非常初级的状态，有很多功能缺失，并且正在持续开发中。\n\r\n所以，它还不适合让所有类型的用户尝试。\n\r\n你还是可以通过拉取 freedesktop.org 上的 nouveau/mesa 项目 的 nvk/main 分支并构建它来尝试它。\n\r\n如果你想的话，你也可以通过贡献到该项目下的 nvk/main 分支 来帮助 NVK 的开发。\n\r\n对于更多的技术信息，你可以参考 官方公告。\n\r\n未来潜力\n\r\nNVK 有很多潜力，尤其是与老化的 nouveau 图形驱动套件相比。\n\r\n这可以为 nouveau 带来一个合适的继承者，同时为 Linux 提供一个带有很多功能的、主流的开源英伟达图形驱动套件。\n\r\n💬 你对此有什么看法？你认为这最终能够实现 nouveau 驱动程序所未能实现的吗？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/nvidia-nvk/\n\r\n作者：Sourav Rudra 选题：lkxed 译者：Cubik65536 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Pop!_OS 22.10 将不会发布。所以，你将无法使用 GNOME 43…… 这里是原因。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nPop!_OS 是一个基于 Ubuntu 的 Linux 发行版，它提供了一个精心设计的用户体验以及强大的软件套件。\n\r\n考虑到它带来的最新技术和桌面环境带来的有用的调整，Pop!_OS 发行版通常值得等待。\n\r\n但是，你将无法获得 Pop!_OS 22.10 发行版。\n\r\nSystem76 希望专注于开发其自己的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面环境，并在未来的版本中放弃 GNOME。😲\n\r\n如果你不知道的话，这是我们对 Pop!_OS 的 COSMIC 桌面环境的旧报道，以供说明：\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n哦，哇哦！Pop!_OS Linux 开发人员正在创建一个基于 Rust 的新桌面环境\n\r\n\r\nPop!_OS 22.10 发行版将不会发布\n\r\n一般在 Ubuntu 发布新的 LTS 和非 LTS 版本之后，Pop!_OS 发行版就会发布。\n\r\n没有 Pop!_OS 22.10，一些用户可能会失望，因为他们无法在 Pop!_OS 上体验 GNOME 43。\n\r\n感谢 OMG!Ubuntu! 发现了 Pop!_OS 开发人员 Michael Murphy 的这个 Reddit 评论。\n\r\nMichael 提到：\n\r\n\r\n我们将会把开发时间集中到 COSMIC 的 Rust 实现上，而不是 22.10。支持多个 Ubuntu 版本需要很大的努力，而 6 个月的发布周期真的会吃掉开发时间和产品的稳定性。\n\r\n\r\n👏 我相信这是一个很好的决定。去年，当他们宣布了基于 Rust 从头开始构建桌面环境的计划时，我总是想知道他们如何做到的。\n\r\n从头开始做一件事并达到用户的期望是一项艰巨的任务，这些用户已经在基于 GNOME 的 Pop!_OS 上拥有了很好的体验。\n\r\nCOSMIC 桌面环境\n\r\n\n\r\n看到 COSMIC 桌面环境的更多发展会很有趣。上次我们尝试它（或看到演示）时，用户会对它感到兴奋，即使它们只是刚刚开始。\n\r\n从技术上讲，它自 2021 年以来就一直在开发中，2023 年的 Pop!_OS 发行版将会带来它。\n\r\n它使用 Rust 编程语言编写，遵循 freedesktop 互操作性规范，并完全移除了对 GNOME 和其 shell 扩展的依赖。\n\r\n我们曾经介绍过 COSMIC 桌面环境的早期预览构建，你可以在这里查看：\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n我尝试了 System76 新的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面！\n\r\n\r\n为什么这是件好事？\n\r\nPop!_OS 的 LTS 版本已经收到了比 Ubuntu 更多的包更新和内核升级，所以你不必担心没有发布 22.10 版本。\n\r\n相反，我们应该期待 Pop!_OS 的下一个主要升级，那时他们会正式介绍 Rust-COSMIC 桌面环境。\n\r\n💬 你对这个决定怎么看？你对未来的 Pop!_OS 发行版有什么期待吗？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/no-pop-os-21-10/\n\r\n作者：Sourav Rudra 选题：lkxed 译者：Cubik65536 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "前言\n为了在上班前再抓紧时间享受一下旅行的快乐，我和女朋友一起去了一趟杭州和绍兴。十年前，我和父母曾经去过一次杭州和苏州，但那时正值盛夏，酷暑难耐，我的父亲出行时又是出了名的紧张和暴躁，导致少了不少游玩的乐趣，杭州在我心目中也并没有留下什么深刻的印象。在一位杭州「土著」同学的怂恿下，为了帮助杭州洗刷这个对她并不公平的心理评价，我决定再来一次杭州。\n按照这位同学说，我们这一次来得正是时候，赶上了杭州为期两周的秋天，早来了太热，晚来了太冷。\n她是没错的。九月底的杭州真的是——好舒服啊！\n除了正午那几个小时，杭州的天气这几天一直稳定在很适宜的温度，在室内和室外几乎没有温差。哪怕是上午快十二点，大晴天走在大街上也只是有丝丝暖意，如果这时候有几阵微风从西湖吹来，送上岸边荷叶清新的香气和清凉，我就会情不自禁地把手臂张开，闭上眼睛，好好感受这让人舒服得跺脚的惬意。\n因为我们这一次以休闲游为主，并没有安排很满的行程，这几天都是睡到自然醒，吃完饭中午才出门，所以行程上也安排得不是很有效率。作为一个旅行攻略太过勉强，但也确确实实享受到了放空身心的那种悠闲和惬意。\n灵隐寺\n食\n很惭愧，这一次是摆烂的行程。因为不想时间太紧张，所以并没有专门搜一些当地人才会去的苍蝇馆子，吃的都是比较常见的连锁餐厅，外婆家、新白鹿、绿茶。我这个外地人尝不出地不地道，但坐着挺舒适，味道也挺好的。我特别喜欢西湖天地那家外婆家，旁边就是西湖，吃完饭去消消食也是一流的。\n第一天晚上杭州的同学带我们去银泰附近吃了一家名为杭州酒家的餐厅。据说已经有一百年历史了。叫花鸡被一层壳包裹，需要客人颇具仪式感地亲自敲几下，而后师傅再帮忙敲开，鸡肉已经酥软无比，香味甚至渗进了骨头；熏鱼比我想象中的多汁，带着一种甜甜的味道；藕粉样子很好看，但感觉味道稍淡了些，响铃沾了不同的酱料味道很丰富。\n叫化鸡响铃\n住\n这次我们选择了在湖滨步行街附近的一家…",

          "description": "在正式开始教程之前首先说明一下目前国行系统的状态：最新版三星云（5.2.00.5）屏蔽了OneDrive备份的入口，直接删除了相关备份软件的服务。因此要在国行系统机器上继续使用OneDrive备份需要降级三星云。如果对Samsung Pay没有需求而对同步有比较大的需求，最简单的方法是刷港版系统。本教程基于One UI 4.1，国行S20。所有需要的安装包均可在教程链接或者apkmirror网站上找到。\n在开始之前需要的准备：一个非大陆地区的三星账号，一个微软账号（需要是个人账号），一个非国行系统的三星手机（也可以是你的国行设备刷港版系统），以及一部国行系统的三星手机（操作对象）。\n第一步，绑定三星账号和微软账户。\n在非国行系统的手机上登录三星账号，然后在相册的设置里，找到云同步，点击按照提示登录微软账户。其中某些步骤容易因为网络原因卡住，不过由于我从来没遇到过，所以有需求的建议在酷安上搜索相关资料，或者全程科学网络。这一步很简单，因此不做过多阐述。\n第二步，降级三星云。\n一般来说，国行系统的三星云会被强制自动更新，因此要想使用备份需要先降级三星云。\n目前在apkmirror上找到能安装也能备份的最新版是5.1.00.13，由于版本号相比国行最新版三星云5.1.05.9更低，需要重新安装。可以现在系统里卸载三星云，再安装此版本的三星云。如果不想重新同步之前的云数据，可以使用ADB直接降级安装。代码我放在下面（为了方便输入，包名我改成了123.apk）\nadb install -r -d D:\\123.apk\n第三步，在国行设备上进行后续操作。\n登录账号之后，下载一个OneDrive，登录之前和三星账户绑定的那个微软账户。登录成功之后就可以暂时忽略这个软件。然后按照链接里的方法在手机上安装lycan，这一步是关键，否则之后的操作都无法进行。\nhttps://www.coolapk.com/feed/32708070?shareKey=YWUwNDI3ZTU5Y2FmNjMzMTVlN2M~&shareUid=964712&shareFrom=com.coolapk.app_5.0.2\n下载「创建快捷方式」这个软件\n【创建快捷方式】 ，打开之后右上角三个点勾选「也显示系统应用」，搜索三星云。点击进入三星云的活动列表，搜索「dashboard」，找到图中这个活动，然后创建一个快捷方式放在桌面。\n\n如果此时打开这个快捷方式，会进入OneDrive同步的那个页面，但是会提示三星云需要更新才能同步，如果不更新就会强制退出。所以我们需要用到lycan屏蔽这个更新提示。\n打开lycan，搜索三星云，在「服务」中将uploadtodrive两项设置成enable\n\n在「接收器」中将下图三项禁用，三项名字均带有update\n\n在「服务」中打开下图两项\n\n此时重新打开刚刚那个快捷方式，就能够正常同步了。\n成功效果如图\n\n如果之后打开三星云又提示更新，可以按照之前的方法降级三星云。不排除之后的系统更新会屏蔽这个接口的可能，只能说且用且珍惜。",

According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, the feature has had law enforcement sent to amusement parks on numerous occasions after mistaking a thrill ride’s twists, turns, and hard braking for a real emergency.\nApple rolled out Crash Detection with its new iPhone 14, Watch Series 8, SE, and Ultra last month, equipping the devices with a gyroscopic sensor and high-g accelerometer trained on the impact experienced with simulated car crashes. If the sensors detect that you’ve been in an accident, your iPhone will display an alert and call...\nContinue reading…",

The purported shift away from Lightning comes as the European Union looks to mandate USB-C charging on new smartphones, tablets, and headphones released in the region in late 2024. While the legislation still hasn’t yet been signed into law, it received approval from the European Parliament last week.\nTo comply with the upcoming rules, Gurman believes Apple might bring USB-C to the next-gen AirPods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods by 2024, while Mac accessories, including the Magic Mouse, Magic Keyboard, and Magic Trackpad could make the switch to USB-C as soon as next...\nContinue reading…",

By diving into the PC market, Microsoft was competing with its Windows partners. By combining laptop and tablet, it was trying to create an entirely new device category. And by designing new software for Arm-powered Windows computers, it was betting that the mobile era would change the way laptops work and the way people use them.\nMicrosoft didn’t get it all right, and it took a couple of years for the Surface line to really hit its stride. But a decade in, you can’t argue with the results: the Surface worked.

          "description": "You may ask why cause there are ton of alternatives already?\n\nThe answer is simple – Google Analytics is the biggest and the most power tool out there, and the new tools which came in past years simply lack that kind of development.\n\nMoreover, more than 60% of the websites globally use GA and most of them can't really switch cause their businesses and tools are linked with GA.\n\nWhat's the solution?\n\nThe primary solution is to deliver Google Analytics via your domain, so you can prevent 3rd party cookies and set first party cookies.\n\nThis also stops Google from tracking the user as soon as he or she moves out of your website/property. A step ahead to be GDPR-Compliant.\n\nIf you want to know more about the whole process, then here's a tweet that I wrote last week which explains everything about the process and the offering.\n\nWhat are the key benefits?\n\n-  Helps you get GDPR Compliant (few other tweaks required in your GA settings section).\n- Helps your GA4 script bypass ad-blockers and providing up to 25% more data.\n\n❤️ Really, hope that you all love it.\n\nIt's still in its development stages, and I'm constantly improving it. If you believe it needs something more, then please let us know. 😇\n\nI’d love to hear your feedback and will hang out here all day to reply to your questions and comments.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
