          "description": "Hey there! \nThis week, I've been looking for some bigger fish to catch, that being doing something bigger than I did before. \nMy open source journey so far has been doing more or less simple things, in order to get to know the community better, and get my tool knowledge up right. So, now that I am fairly confident in myself (in terms of Open Source contributing) and my skills, it is finally time to get working harder.\nWhat sounds more perfect in my case than implementing a new feature instead of fixing a visual bug? Exactly! So, my initial plan was to find myself an issue that required to write new code, instead of fixing the existing stuff. It was time to find something to work on.\nAfter searching for a couple of hours, I found an issue that appealed a lot to me.\nIt was in a repo called Wego Overseer, which appears to be a Discord bot for a specific community. Chat bots have always been something I wanted to try, and this sounded like a perfect opportunity!\nThe issue itself was about implementing a chat poll feature that could be done via emoji-reactions under a message. This felt to me like something I have been searching for, challenging my skills and not as easy as my previous contributions.\nBefore jumping right into coding, I will have to examine the project and do some research about the tools it uses, such as Discord.js, knex, and Objection.\nFirst things first, I will have to set it up locally and get it running. Then, I'll test it a bit to sense the way it works.\nAfter setting up, I will read through documentation on the tools I have mentioned before. Once I get a hang of how they are used, I will try to design my solution, i.e. how the poll creator UX will feel, how the poll will look like, what logic it will be using in order to show poll results, think of other details, etc.\nAfter my solution is looking good on paper, and I have a feeling of how to implement it, I will start coding. I will try to create a new command first, and then gradually try turning it into how I designed it.\nHoping it goes well!",

          "description": "Git 的 bisect 工具通过快速识别坏的提交，节省了时间和精力。\n\r\n\r\n你是不是有过这样的经历：发现代码中有 错误bug，但不知道这个错误是什么时候引入的。这有可能是因为，某个人提交了一份有错误的代码，但没有在他的 Git 提交commit 消息中声明它。这个错误可能已经存在了几周、几个月甚至几年，这意味着你需要搜索数百或数千个提交，才能找到问题何时出现的。而 git bisect 命令能够完美地解决这个问题！\n\r\ngit bisect 命令是一个强大的工具。你可以给 git bisect 命令一个范围，一端是一个已知的好状态，另一端是一个已知的坏状态。它会自动地确认当前范围的中点，在这个中点上进行测试，然后要求你确定那次提交是一个 好提交good commit 还是一个 坏提交bad commit，然后它会重复这一“二分查找”的过程，直到你找到首次引入错误的那一次提交。\n\r\n\n\r\n这个“数学”工具是利用“二分查找”来找到错误之处的。git bisect 命令通过查看中点，然后由你来决定它是提交列表的新起点（即 “坏提交” ）还是新终点（即 “好提交”），进而来缩小查找范围，如此在几次查找中你可以就能定位到有错误的提交。即使你有 10,000 个提交要检查，最多只需要 13 次查找，就能很快地定位到首次引入错误的提交。\n\r\n\r\n提交 1 坏 <> 提交 10,000 好 => 提交 5,000 是坏的\n\r\n提交 5,000 坏 <> 提交 10,000 好 => 提交 7,500 是好的\n\r\n提交 5,000 坏 <> 提交 7,500 好 => 提交 6,250 是好的\n\r\n提交 5,000 坏 <> 提交 6,250 好 => 提交 5,625 是坏的\n\r\n提交 5,625 坏 <> 提交 6,250 好 => 提交 5,938 是坏的\n\r\n提交 5,938 坏 <> 提交 6,250 好 => 提交 6,094 是好的\n\r\n提交 5,938 坏 <> 提交 6,094 好 => 提交 6,016 是坏的\n\r\n提交 6,016 坏 <> 提交 6,094 好 => 提交 6,055 是好的\n\r\n提交 6,016 坏 <> 提交 6,055 好 => 提交 6,036 是坏的\n\r\n提交 6,036 坏 <> 提交 6,055 好 => 提交 6,046 是坏的\n\r\n提交 6,046 坏 <> 提交 6,055 好 => 提交 6,050 是坏的\n\r\n提交 6,050 坏 <> 提交 6,055 好 => 提交 6,053 是好的\n\r\n提交 6,053 坏 <> 提交 6,055 好 => 提交 6,054 是好的\n\r\n\r\n对于上面这个例子，我们能知道 10,000 个提交中的第一个错误提交是第 6053 次提交。对于 git bisect 命令，最多需要几分钟就能完成检索。但是如果要一个一个查找每个提交是否错误，我甚至无法想象需要多长时间。\n\r\n使用 Git bisect 命令\n\r\ngit bisect 命令使用起来非常简单：\n\r\n（LCTT 译注：使用 git bisect start 命令来进入 bisect 模式，并且该命令指定了一个检查范围。它会告诉我们一共有多少次提交，大概需要几步就可以定位到具体的提交。）\n\r\n$ git bisect start\r\n$ git bisect bad        # Git assumes you mean HEAD by default\r\n$ git bisect good <ref> # specify a tag or commit ID for <ref>\r\n\n\r\nGit 检查中间的提交，并等待你声明这次提交是一个好提交还是一个坏提交：\n\r\n（LCTT 译注：如果某一提交是可以通过的，则使用 git bisect good 命令标记；同样地，如果某一提交不能通过，则使用 git bisect bad 命令标记。）\n\r\n$ git bisect good\r\n\n\r\n或\n\r\n$ git bisect bad\r\n\n\r\n然后，git bisect 工具重复检查好提交和坏提交中间的那次提交，直到你告诉它：\n\r\n$ git bisect reset\r\n\n\r\n一些高级用户甚至可以自己编写脚本，来确定提交的好坏状态、并在找到特定提交时采取某一补救措施。你可能不会每天都使用 git bisect 命令，但当你需要它来定位首次引入错误的提交时，它会是一个很有用的救星。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/11/git-bisect\n\r\n作者：Dwayne McDaniel 选题：lkxed 译者：chai001125 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "埃隆·马斯克证实，加密私信即将到来! 这是好东西。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n今年早些时候，埃隆·马斯克 在 Twitter 上表示：Twitter 的 私信Direct Messages（DM）需要像 Signal 协议这样的 端到端加密End-to-End Encryption。\n\r\n早在 2016 年，爱德华·斯诺登就 要求 Twitter 的前首席执行官兼联合创始人杰克·多尔西添加 Signal 协议类似的安全措施到 Twitter 平台。\n\r\n但是，这个协议从来没有被添加到 Twitter。它可能经过测试但还未部署实施。\n\r\n根据最近的公告，Twitter 似乎即将实现这个安全协议 😌。\n\r\n马斯克分享了他在公司演讲中的几张幻灯片，其中就包括为 Twitter 2.0 路线图规划的“加密私信”。\n\r\n🔒 Twitter 通信的 Signal 协议\n\r\n\n\r\n虽然有一些安全研究员，例如 黄文津，已经在 Twitter 的 iOS 和 Android 应用程序中发现了对 Signal 协议 的代码引用。\n\r\n但是直到现在，埃隆·马斯克才在 推文 中确认了该计划，该推文介绍了根据 “Twitter 2.0” 路线图将对 Twitter 平台进行的改进。\n\r\n换句话说，埃隆·马斯克正式确认 Twitter 即将推出加密私信。\n\r\n\n\r\n对于那些不知道 Signal 协议的人，我们简要地介绍一下 Signal 协议：Signal 协议是一种开源的加密协议，它允许以 完全前向保密perfect forward secrecy（PFS）方式实施端到端加密。\n\r\n该协议使用 “双棘轮算法Double Ratchet algorithm”，通信双方根据不断变化的共享密钥，来交换加密的消息。\n\r\n这确保没有第三方可以得到通信消息的内容，因为共享密钥仅存在于通信双方的设备上。\n\r\nSignal 应用程序充分利用了这个方法。但是，进一步来说，还有几个以隐私为中心的替代方案：\n\r\n（LCTT 译注：Signal 协议是一种真正的端到端加密的通讯协议，号称是世界上最安全的通讯协议。只有参与通讯的用户可以读取并解密信息，而任何第三方（包括服务器）都无法查看到通讯的内容。总的来说，它可以防止潜在的窃听者（包括：通信服务商、互联网服务提供商甚至是该通讯系统的提供者），获取能够用以解密通讯内容的密钥。目前有大量即时通讯软件也使用或借鉴参考了 Signal 协议，例如：Skype、What'sApp、Facebook Messenger）\n\r\nSignal 协议如何帮助 Twitter DM？\n\r\n它可以防止恶意攻击者和政府去窥探 Twitter 用户的消息，从而使 Twitter 成为一个更加安全的平台。\n\r\nTwitter 添加加密私信会对举报人、记者和社会活动家有益，因为他们经常会因其工作而面临被审查或成为攻击目标。\n\r\n诚然，就隐私而言，加密私信可能不是最严格的保护措施。但有总比没有好。\n\r\n🔏 加密消息应该成为通讯软件的标准\n\r\n在这个动荡的信息时代，我们看到更多的恶意攻击者试图未经授权访问敏感信息。\n\r\n端到端加密应成为所有通讯软件的必要标准，我希望 Twitter 能够尽快添加它。\n\r\n你有什么想法吗？请在下面的评论区中分享你的想法吧。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/twitter-signal/\n\r\n作者：Sourav Rudra 选题：lkxed 译者：chai001125 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "OPTION-O Lagom mini 是一群澳洲的咖啡爱好者工程师在 2016 年决定结合自己的工作技能和爱好技能打造的产品，是近年来比较流行的创业故事。\nLagom mini 首先在外形上就和传统磨豆机大相径庭，许多网红磨豆机是把磨豆机的颜值提升到了极致，但你还是能一眼看出来这是个磨豆机，调节转盘、豆仓、方方正正的造型，该有的都有。而 Lagom mini 则是三个有着浓郁 「苹果范」 的铝合金圆柱体，不管是银色的铝合金光泽还是 CNC 痕迹都像极了 Mac 电脑，圆柱体中集成了刀盘调节装置 —— 圆柱中裂出的一条缝，如果不仔细看，就是三个矗立在那的银色圆柱。\n\n同时也得益于高度集成的设计，Lagom mini 体积极小，抛开大的不和谐的电源，Lagom mini 的机身比手摇磨豆机大不了多少，或者说这就是一个有着电机驱动和更稳定结构的手摇磨豆机，就像 Mac mini，比 MacBook / 手摇磨豆机大一点，你还需要外接电源工作，但你确实可以将它们带出房间，而不是像传统台式机和电动磨豆机那样局限在房屋里，在 Glamping 火热的当下，这个优点极其突出。\n\n致敬苹果的不仅是外观设计，还有对磁铁的运用，接粉罐和底座通过磁吸连接，只要放过去就能自动归位，让出粉口对准罐子，避免撒漏。还有豆仓盖也是嵌入了磁铁，放进豆子，盖子也是自动归位，非常巧妙的设计。\n\n还是因为出色的结构设计，Lagom mini 调节简单，最大的圆柱体其实是由两部分组成，拧动调节间距挤压上下刀盘的距离就能调节磨豆的粗细，从意式到手冲到法压壶都能胜任，不过不推荐意式，为啥放缺点那讲。\n\n作为一台磨豆机，其核心当然是高精度、稳定、均匀的研磨，和所有定量设备一样，只要想做到稳定的高精度，其难度和成本必然是成几何级增长的，这也是比 200 块的磨豆机优秀的地方。Lagom mini 的 48mm 锥刀粒径分布均匀，我大概的用筛网筛了一下，极细粉少多了，最多的中间粉颗粒分布也均匀，能让做出的咖啡风味更稳定，不会一次酸一次苦的。\n冲煮前后的咖啡粉\nLagom mini 的一大特色是 「零残粉」，它的出粉通道设计的很巧妙，在锥刀下有三扇摆动叶片，随着锥刀一同旋转将磨碎掉落下的咖啡粉扫到出粉口掉出，将出粉通道缩减到最小，这样就几乎没有残粉了，根据我的试验，正常情况下进豆和出粉的重量差一般都在 0.1 克内。\n如果你还不满意，可以和我一样购置一个 3D 打印的吹粉豆仓盖，用按压吹一吹，不过由于接粉罐很小，30 克豆子就有溢出的风险了，如果再一吹，就很容易吹的到处都是，如果 Lagom mini 能把接粉罐的直径做大一圈，同时让出粉口内插进去而不是像现在这样出粉口悬浮在接粉罐上沿 2mm 的位置，完全杜绝散落就完美了。\n\n目前看，吹气豆仓在吹残粉有咖啡粉漫天飞舞的隐患，而小拨片和老式的敲打都不够优雅，可能泰摩那扭一扭的机关扳手才是完美形态吧。\n除开以上，Lagom mini 最大的问题是静电消除不够好，大概是全金属机身的天生缺陷吧，每次磨完豆子，豆仓内一定会遗留大量的银皮粉屑混合物，丢失的 0.1 克大概就在这吧。如果用喷水老办法能缓解一部分，不过会带来新问题 —— 豆子粘在豆仓壁上下不去，甚至是直接卡在颈口，就很尴尬，每次磨完都得打开瞅一瞅。\n\n再吹毛求疵点，一是硕大的电源能不能小型化一点，不知道的还以为是老款 MacBook Pro 的电源呢，如果能改成 C 口支持移动电源直驱就更完美了。二是磨豆速度有点慢，磨 20 克豆子能要个小一分钟，如果是磨 Espresso 的细度，那得到地老天荒。\n\n满分的话，我能给 Lagom mini 打上个 86 分，足够跨入优秀磨豆机的行列，只是优秀如鲠在喉的小问题让你用的没那么顺畅，作为初创团队的首款作品还是值得赞扬的，希望二代能保留优点改进不足，让家用磨豆机市场更卷一点。",

          "description": "最近，我在尝试使用画图思考。虽然只是简单应用，但是收获颇丰，值得梳理总结出来。 我会从电脑和本子两个方面来说说自己的实践。\n电脑\n电脑软件上，我来说说 Excalidraw 和 Craft 这两款应用。\nExcalidraw\n\n说到画图，Excalidraw 这个应用肯定绕不过。我在电脑上的思路梳理，知识分享，还有学习的沉淀，都在高度依赖这个应用。它是一款在线的白板软件，风格和字体偏手绘风格，我很享受在上面涂涂画画的过程。\n\n思路梳理的时候，我会把自己的问题先写在白板上，然后自由发散，记录下现状。接下来，我会通过观察画布上的一个个关键字，去做分类的和关联的操作。在动手的过程中，很可能一些思路就已经慢慢出来。画布可以很好承载网状的思考，通过拖拽，连线，分层，让我在脑子里混乱的思绪，一步步清晰。如果看着画布上的关键字，一时没有找到解决方案，也不用着急，就安静观察，静下心来，慢慢琢磨。\n\n和朋友分享观点或知识，我亦经常在这个白板上画图。有了白板，我们讨论问题的时候，可以把一些发散的问题记录到一个位置，等主要内容分享完之后，回头继续梳理。白板的展示方式，可以更好吸引对方的兴趣和注意力。我也经常感受到，在和别人交流过程中画图，会不知不觉，产生一个新的观点，或者对自己的思路愈发清晰。\n\n最后说说学习的沉淀，抛开做笔记，我最喜欢的就是面对这个白板做知识的总结。写作困难的地方也许是从零开始，梳理知识应该也是。没有参考的情况下，列出知识大纲，结构化总结，是一件困难的事情。就是这种每次面对白板的梳理，让我可以更好检视自己的学习成果。同时，白板画图，使我我对分层学习，有了更直观的感受。\nCraft\nCraft 是一款笔记应用。这款应用好在配图和分享非常方便流畅。我在分享给朋友的一些文字上，会配上一张图片。不要小看文章或者句子的配图，这个配图如果合适，会加深对句子的印象。\n\n除了分享的配图，我还会在学习专业书籍时，对目录大纲做一个梳理，同样会配上方便我联想记忆的图片。看目录标题，思考关联图片，搜索图片，然后上传图片到 Craft 的过程，虽然繁琐，但实在是一劳永逸的事情。我回顾知识框架的时候，一看到图片，就会很自然想到，自己当时为什么选择了这种图，这张图含义是什么，大部分都可以直接根据图片，推敲出章节标题。\n\n找图片，激发自己使用右脑联想记忆，这个过程其实步骤很多。经常遇到找不到合适的图片来表达，在这时，我会在 Excalidraw 上画图。过程虽然花费不少时间，但是在这个思考和主动寻找关联关系的过程，其实已经在慢慢消化和记忆知识。\n\n本子\n便利贴\n我把便利贴当作一个有边界的草稿纸。我在想一些细碎问题的时候，会打开便利贴画一下思路和草图，一个问题，不会超过一张便利贴去思考。举个例子，上周的茶话会，分享前，我在便利贴上圈圈点点，画出大纲和思路。随后我把便利贴揉成一团丢掉，暗示自己思路已经准备就绪。\n\n便利贴的天然边界，和撕下来的特性，很好地辅助了我思考。生活中很多问题会突然出现，便利贴的便利性，就是良好的应对方式。它的第一页，在安静等待着你写写画画，接着被你撕下。一页便利贴没有过多的空间，这个特点，帮助我自然而然去聚焦问题的重点。\n子弹笔记\n为了让生活中很多琐事更有趣，我会在子弹笔记上，用画图的方式去给自己分配任务。比如，清理卧室，衣柜部分很多衣服需要清点，我就会把衣柜的实物画出来。当我清理完一部分格子，我会用荧光笔涂上颜色。\n我在实践中，体会到画图的三个优点。首先是直观，无论是进度还是已经完成的程度，我一眼看上去，都有直观的感知。其次是低压力，看图片去想自己要做什么，和看清单上的文字，压力不一样。最后是愉悦感，看图的时候，因为低压力和直观，让我做事的时候心情更好。\n\n除了通过画图拆分任务，我还使用荧光笔快速分类子弹笔记中的任务。比如，某一天傍晚，我打算采购想要购买的东西。由于子弹笔记是一般是按照流水线的方式记录要任务，我的本子上没有一个页面或者清单专门记录。\n\n很自然地，我拿起某个颜色的荧光笔，在本子上把这几天未完成的购买任务，涂上同样的颜色。很短的时间内，我就快速把购买的东西过滤出来，然后拿出手机去一件件下单。\n总结\n\n从电脑上的画图实践，我学习到，多画图可以捋清思路。合适的配图，能加深印象。在本子上的实践，我学习到便利贴的边界能辅助快速思考。最后是，眼睛，分辨颜色和形状效率很高。\n我的实践，如标题所言，确实非常简单。即便如此，这些实践也不是我自己凭空想象。《认知心理学》《游戏改变世界》《子弹整理思考术》《活用一辈子的读书笔记术》《一页纸工作整理术》，这五本书对我启发很大。学习和生活，都离不开知行合一。希望自己能够在成长的路上，多实践，多沉淀。",

          "description": "人要坚持一件事情真的很难，一不小心，少数派思考就鸽了一个多月。上周六我上了一次「得到」的直播，也是罗振宇老师的年度演讲策划会，在会上我提出了两个观点，在这里跟大家分享一下。\n用实业心态创业，用实业思维做互联网产品\n这句话其实在我脑海中已经很多年了，可能跟我之前从事的传统行业有关系。不管是做哪个行业和产品，我都非常在意它给用户提供的本质价值，比如我推销过纳米汽车清洁产品，就会一直纠结它的实际效果怎么样，不断反馈问题；我出口过弹簧钢丝，也更关注海外客户的使用反馈，了解我们的工艺跟其他国家的差距在哪里。\n但互联网的兴起，好像改变了这些底层规则，因为要快、要规模、所以要免费，羊毛要出在猪身上。不知不觉，服务和产品的本质都被动摇了。我非常感恩互联网，因为这个工具和时代，让给我有了创业的机会，帮我把爱好变成了事业，但我不迷信互联网，它是一个好工具，但不是产品和服务的本质。\n简单举两个例子：\n今天的外卖让我们的餐饮高效便利，但餐饮的本质是菜品和味道，如果菜品难吃又不干净，你送餐的速度的再快也没有意义，我能忍一次两次，忍不了第三次。\n今天的娱乐，让我们随时随地可以听音乐，看电影，但平台的争斗和互卷，让创作者无奈，让好的内容越来越少，最终变得没什么可看了。\n所以，一个产品和服务，要想保持长期可持续的生命力，就要回归用户需求，用实业思维把东西夯实，夯成自己的真正壁垒，它可能会很慢，规模也不大，但它可以穿越周期，做成百年老店。接下来十年，可能是一个慢下来的新周期，这个思维就更加重要。\n直播中有一个提前准备的问题，没来得及讲，我可以在这里补充一下：\n当下环境，你会给准备创业的朋友哪些建议和叮嘱？\n先想好怎样活下来，今天的市场更加残酷，没有红利、没有资本，用户更谨慎和挑剔。\n少讲故事，如果你的业务短期内没法商业化，就要想好长期策略，比如控制成本，小步快跑等等。\n别追风口，多关注细分市场的机会，关注年轻的主力消费人群，未来是创意和个性化的时代。\n不要社恐，不要闭门造车，要主动联络和运用身边的一切资源。\n创新不是颠覆，是将好做到优秀，再把优秀做成经典的过程\n这句话不是我说的，而是来自 150 年历史的德国莱茵公司。三年前我前往德国参观了他们的公司和业务，七天行程的结束，莱茵大中华区电子电气副总裁 Jay 总结了这句话，引发了我的思考。\n巧合的是，我八年前做出口业务的时候，有很多欧洲的客户，我去了解他们的背景，发现大多都是做了几十年的企业。他们都是深耕自己的领域，比如一家制造扫街刷子的公司，从塑料制刷改成钢丝刷，从扫街到扫管道，不停优化工艺，不停的延伸拓展，始终保持自己的市场地位。\n而互联网时代，我们经常讲创新，讲颠覆，强调一个技术出现，就会改变一个行业，我就是这个行业的佼佼者。我们承认趋势的存在，但趋势是波浪，一旦过去了，你还要靠自己的实力去创造价值，只是这个趋势周期比较长，我们还没有真正经历和感受过低谷。\n所以我后来一直思考这句话，它可能就是一个百年企业的运营真谛，不要觉得事情小，而是关注它的价值。150 年前的莱茵公司，是给蒸汽锅炉做安全认证的，因为品质不统一，操作不规范，它经常出现致命的事故，先做好这件事，保证工人的生命安全。后面再一点点拓展到更多的领域，最后形成了人人信赖的品牌。\n做一份少数派的报告\n虽然，以上这些海外企业的成长经历，跟我们的周期和环境有很大区别，但我依然认同这些底层的观点：把一件事情做好做透，拥有你最核心的用户群，先完成你基本的商业闭环，然后再围绕用户和市场的需求去慢慢拓展。这跟以往的互联网思维是基本相悖的，但从更高的维度和更长的周期来看，我依然相信这是正确的。\n我们在直播中聊到，是不是可以整理一个具备这些特质的企业清单，讲讲他们的故事，我们可以把它叫做真正的《少数派报告》，也希望这些案例，能在寒冬之中，引领更多创业者找到自己的方向。",

          "description": "虽然现在多屏用户逐渐变多，但仍是小众，Windows 也并没过对多屏使用进行太多的优化。所以只好自己动手，于是有了以下一些个人自用的优化设置。\n窗口出现位置优化\nWindows 系统仅对多屏用户提供了简单主显示器的设置，默认情况下所有新打开的窗口都只会出现在主显示器上，即使你在使用另一个的显示器。而「基于显示器连接记住窗口位置」只能记住上次关闭时所在的屏幕，实用性并不高。\n\n这时微软自家的 Power Toys 里的 FancyZones 就可以派上用场了，除了我们熟知的窗口布局设置外，它还可以调整窗口行为，在这里我们可以通过启用「将新创建的窗口移动到当前 活动的监视器（实验性）」来达到这一效果，美中不足的是动画不够优雅。\n\n窗口出现的问题解决了，但任务栏上默认是显示所有屏幕上的窗口，不能让我们快速区分哪些应用是在当前屏幕下的。\n\n为了解决该问题，如下图所示，Windows 提供了简陋的选项加让人摸不着头脑的翻译。设置后，每个屏幕下的任务栏就只显示当前屏幕下打开的窗口，更符合直觉，不过 Win + 数字 的快捷键就只能在主显示器上使用了。\n\n内容显示优化\n现在 Windows 下大部分的应用都适配高 DPI 的，少部分不支持的，也可以通过 Windows 自带的属性 - 兼容性选项来调整。\n\n上面的设置仅解决了单个应用在高分辨率屏幕下的问题，并不能解决应用在分辨率相差太大的显示器间移动时会出现界面变形问题。这时，如果你使用的 AMD 显卡，那你可以通过启用 AMD Radeon Software 里的「超虚拟分辨率」来让低分辨率屏切换到更高的逻辑分辨率，不仅缩小的多屏间的分辨率差距，还有抗锯齿的效果。由于个人没有使用 Nvidia 和 Intel 显卡，相关选项是否存在请自行到显卡设置里翻找。\n\n设置完成后到 Windows 设置调整下逻辑分辨率和缩放即可。\n\n除此之外，对于我们网上冲浪必备的浏览器，它的缩放是固定的，且只有一个设置选项。不知道有没有人跟我一样两个屏幕的缩放比例是不一样的，在两个屏幕间移动浏览器时，网页内容并不会根据 DPI 而变化，导致观感割裂。在这里我推荐一个 FireFox 浏览器插件：ffreszoom，它可以实时感知屏幕宽度的变化，当宽度超过指定值时，自动调整到指定缩放比例。设置前先通过这个网站查看自己的屏幕宽度：http://whatismyscreenresolution.net/，需要将 Firefox 浏览器移动到不同显示器上刷新。\n\n如图所示我的外屏宽度是 1728 px，笔记本内屏为 1024，所以我在两者之间随意取了一个值用于判断，若当前屏幕宽度超过 1600 px，就自动设置缩放为 1.5，也即 150%。若小于 1600 px，则使用浏览器设置里的值。两种缩放无缝切换，只会多了一个缩放的动画。由于本人没使用 Chromium 类浏览器，并没有对应的插件推荐，不过其用户这么多，应该会有类似的插件。\n\n利用「闲置的」触摸板\n不知有没有跟我一样喜欢使用笔记本键盘的，且平时一些简单的操作直接用触摸板直接操作。现在 Windows 11 已经支持自定义触摸板多指手势了，但其不能根据不同应用设置不同的手势，例如：A 软件可以用 Ctrl  + W 关闭，但 B 软件只能用 Alt + F4，同一个操作有不同的快捷键。\n\n这时就需要第三方软件了，这里我推荐 GestureSign，界面虽然是 Windows 10 风格，但不影响使用，毕竟设置完就不用再看了。它可以为不同应用的不同快捷键键设置相同的触控手势，手势类型也不再仅限于横平竖直，可以自由发挥。同时软件也内置了一些常用的命令供选择。\n\n上图是我的一些设置，双指一般使用系统默认就不添加上去了。其中个人最爱的是三指滑动切换标签，体验比鼠标点击更加符合人的直觉。对于频繁使用搜索启动器的我，把三指上滑指定为搜索启动器的快捷键，方便呼出。\n \n对了，设置前记得把系统自带的相关手势取消掉，不然会冲突。若你仍不习惯使用触摸板，该软件也支持鼠标手势，具体可以自行下载体验。\n结尾\n以上便是我在使用多屏时遇到的问题，及相关解决方法，希望对多屏用户有帮助。",

          "description": "The 2020 MacBook Air, one of the best laptops you can get, is frequently on sale. | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nWith multiple configurations and various models to choose from, finding a deal on an M1-equipped MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult. It’s sometimes a slightly different story for the MacBook Pros with the beefier M1 Pro and M1 Max CPUs, but any savings you can get on those Pro models is sure to be worthwhile. As for the newer 13-inch MacBook Pro and MacBook Air with M2 processors, it may take time to see truly sizable savings.\nHere, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the current MacBooks, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, you may still find older Intel-based configurations lying around, with some heavy closeout sales. While those are compatible with the recently launched m...\nContinue reading…",

It’s the color option, in fact: Pantone’s newly crowned color of the year, Viva Magenta. And you know what? It looks kinda nice. Not every phone needs to be Moonstone Black or Deep Cosmos Blue. We crave bold colors, too, and Motorola has answered the call — and you don’t even need a special Adobe subscription to enjoy it.\nThe Edge 30 Fusion comes with upper-midrange specs, including a previous-gen flagship Qualcomm processor, the Snapdragon 888 Plus 5G. That’ll still be plenty powerful in 2023, especially with the 12GB of RAM this particular variant comes with. There’s a 6.55-inch, 1080p OLED display with a top 144Hz refresh...\nContinue reading…",
