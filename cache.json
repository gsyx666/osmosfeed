For example, given there are many sources of outages for an application, if CloudWildBoar is an insignificant contributor to its downtime, then users are correct to not worry about it.\nCloudWildBoar does not exist. It is not a service on AWS (yet?) or any other cloud provider. I made it up.\nThe sentence is not mine, it originally referred to Google Spanner and it is from an old article “Inside Cloud Spanner and the CAP Theorem”.\nBut I always keep the sentence handy for any meetup, conference, tech discussion when someone asks or brags about availability, number of nines of a specific provider, database, service or feature.\nAWS or any cloud provider and their specific services might have occasional failures and you should be aware of those. And there are limited scenarios where it really matters. But usually the weakest links are your own application and deployment. \nFix those, sit down and relax.

          "description": "Another cool part about medusa is that we can use services to interact with existing functionality.\nFor instance, we can access the ProductService from there. We can retrieve products but also create and update them.\nLet's see how we can use these services inside our custom routes.\nFor this example, I'll be using the ProductService. First, we'll want to add a custom route endpoint.\nInside our custom route, we can start by assigning this service like this.\nconst productService = req.scope.resolve('productService');\n\nLet's say we want to list all products. We can easily do that with the following command.\nrouter.get('/store/test', async (req, res) => {\n  const productService = req.scope.resolve('productService');\n  productService.list().then((products) => {\n    res.json(products);\n  });\n});\n\nIf you now restart your server and query this endpoint, you should be able to see a list of your products. (My database only has one effect).\n\nThis is, of course, not super beneficial as we already have an endpoint to retrieve precisely this information.\nrouter.get('/store/test', async (req, res) => {\n  const productService = req.scope.resolve('productService');\n  productService.list({}, { relations: ['variants'] }).then((products) => {\n    res.json(\n      products.filter((product) =>\n        product.variants.some((variant) => variant.inventory_quantity >= 0)\n      )\n    );\n  });\n});\n\nWe have quite a few changes here. Let's take a closer look.\n{}: The first option is the params to query on. In our case, nothing in particular\n{relations:['variants']}: This can be used to add specific options to the query. We want to add the variants\nOnce we have this, we filter all products and only return products where at least one variant has stock.\nYou can play with adjusting the stock levels in the query.\nAnd that's it, we super powerful way of querying from service in medusa.\nThank you for reading my blog.

          "description": "这是 GNOME “文件”中的“新建文件”功能，它为你提供了一种创建文档和文件的新方法。让我们看一看。\n\r\n\r\n无需在后端进行更多调整。通过“文件Files”（又名 Nautilus）中的上下文菜单创建新文档/新文件的最令人期待的功能终于到来了。\n\r\n作为 谷歌编程之夏 2022 的一部分，（由 Ignacy Kuchciński 开发的）这个新功能最近经过审查并合并到 “文件” 的主分支中。\n\r\n它看起来如何\n\r\n当你右键单击文件时，上下文菜单有一个新选项“新建文件New File”。\n\r\n\n\r\nGNOME “文件”中的“新建文件New File”选项启动一个操作窗口，如下图所示。\n\r\n\n\r\n当它启动上述对话框时，会在后台发生一些事情。\n\r\n你可能知道你可以在主目录中创建一个带有模板的 Template 文件夹，以便轻松访问常用的文档类型。因此，GNOME “文件” 会检查你是否有该目录。\n\r\n如果当前存在一个带有模板的 Template 目录，你能通过那些文档类型的列表以创建新文档。\n\r\n\n\r\n如果你没有任何模板（很可能），GNOME “文件”会扫描你的系统并根据系统中已安装的应用程序显示常见文件类型的列表。\n\r\n例如，文本编辑器、LibreOffice 文档类型（电子表格、演示文稿）等。\n\r\n这里还发生了一些其他事情。当你为新文档选择文件类型时，系统会选择默认的文件扩展名。这是文件名文本框中的受保护标签。\n\r\n此外，如果你没有安装任何模板或任何应用程序，则根本不会显示“新建文件”菜单选项。\n\r\n未来路线图\n\r\n开发人员还提出了未来对该功能的增强，更大程度地扩展其功能。\n\r\n当没有可用的模板时，对话框将如下所示。它将允许你通过选择应用程序来创建文件，包括空白文件。\n\r\n此外，你可以直接启动软件来安装一些可以帮助你创建相应文件类型的应用程序。\n\r\n由于这个功能比较复杂，可能会在以后开发。目前还没有时间表。\n\r\n这在“文件” v43 中可用（通过 GNOME 43）吗？\n\r\n但是，在我看来，这种变化需要一些额外的设计审查。我觉得它不完整。例如，当你有模板时，你无法创建标准文档类型（文本、LibreOffice 文档）—— 这两个对话框是互斥的。另外，我发现了一些小 BUG。\n\r\n尽管该功能目前 已获得批准和合并，但由于日程冲突，它无法进入 GNOME 43候选版本。\n\r\n希望在经过一轮良好的审查和测试后，你可以在明年的 GNOME 44 版本中获得此功能。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n总的来说，这是一个优雅的功能，我认为如今没有任何其他文件管理器具有这种先进的设计。一旦这个“文件”的“新建文件”功能被完全实现，它将会是其出色功能集的一个很好的补充。\n\r\n那么，你喜欢这个新设计吗？请在评论框中告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/gnome-files-new-file-document/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：littlebirdnest 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Penpot 是一个自由开源的解决方案，能够替代 Figma 或类似的设计工具。你怎么看？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nAdobe 以高达 200 亿美元的价格收购了流行的设计工具 Figma。\n\r\n像往常一样，大型科技公司通过收购企业来消除竞争。因此，这并不完全是一个令人兴奋的消息。\n\r\n但是，令人兴奋的是，我们遇到了一个自由开源的设计工具，它从 Figma 中获得灵感并且做得更好！\n\r\nPenpot：正在开发中的自由开源的设计工具\n\r\n\n\r\nPenpot enpot 是一个正在积极开发的开源项目。将近两年前，它在 ProductHunt 上推出，目前处于测试阶段。\n\r\nPenpot 值得关注的地方：\n\r\n\r\n自由开源（当然）。\n\r\n可以选择自托管。\n\r\n跨平台。\n\r\n使用 SVG 作为原生格式。\n\r\n基于 Web。\n\r\n具有行业标准功能（受 Figma 启发）。\n\r\n\r\n你可以观看其官方视频以了解其基础知识：\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nPenpot 的主要亮点是使用 SVG 作为其原生格式。使用 SVG 文件，你可以获得与许多矢量图形编辑工具很好的兼容性。\n\r\n因此，你保存下来的文件，同样可以被其他的图片编辑软件打开，而不会被其专有的格式锁定在一个特定的软件上。\n\r\nPenpot 为你提供绝对最佳的开放标准。\n\r\nPenpot 的 CEO，Pablo Ruiz-Múzquiz 提到了更多：\n\r\n\r\n如果你在存储层面上采用 SVG（开放标准，支持 Web，移动互联网等），你马上就可以将你所有的 Penpot 设计与你的代码库整合起来。由于采用了 SVG 而不是另一种封闭的格式，你可以对设计本身的实际表现进行修改。这为设计师和开发人员打开了巨大的机会之门。另外，SVG 意味着我们免费地就为低代码提供了支持。你可以在 Penpot 中选择任何元素并查看它的 SVG（和 CSS）形式，知道它实际上是什么，无需翻译。这给设计师和开发人员之间带来了更值得信赖的关系，并允许前端开发人员尝试他们的设计技能。\n\r\n\r\n所以，使用 SVG 作为原生格式有很多优势！\n\r\n目前，该项目处于测试阶段，且在项目中有大量熟练的贡献者不断改进。\n\r\n这可以让它变成 Figma 最有用的开源替代品，让设计工具突破了大型技术公司。\n\r\n你可以自行托管它或使用云应用程序对其进行测试。在其官方网站上注册以学习和试验它。\n\r\n你还可以查看其 GitHub 页面 以探索更多信息。\n\r\n\r\nPenpot\n\r\n\r\n这也让我想起了 Akira，它的目标是成为一个用于 UI 和 UX 设计的原生 Linux 应用程序。它仍处于早期开发阶段，但当涉及 Linux 或开源计划时，这种努力总是受到赞赏。\n\r\n💬 你如何看待 Penpot 作为 Figma 的开源替代品？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/penpot-figma-alternative/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lkxed 译者：littlebirdnest 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "合作伙伴关系的增长加速了 FHE 市场的采用。\n\r\n\r\n据 Duality 技术公司的新闻稿，谷歌已将其在 GitHub 上开源的使用 XLS SDK 开发的开源项目完全同态加密（FHE）转译器与领先的开源完全同态加密fully homomorphic encryption库 OpenFHE 合并。通过使加密知识更简单、更容易接近，开发者对 FHE 的采用将增加。\n\r\n这类称为 FHE 的加密技术不同于更常见的加密技术，因为它可以直接对加密数据进行计算，而无需密钥。一个由知名密码学家组成的社区创建了 OpenFHE，这是一个根深于后量子开源晶格密码学的加密库。\n\r\n该库旨在实现最佳可用性、增强的 API、模块化、跨平台可移植性，以及与硬件结合时的项目加速器。开发人员可以通过将 OpenFHE 与谷歌的转译器结合起来，使用高级代码来操作加密数据，例如经常用于未加密数据的 C++，而不需要学习密码学。\n\r\n谷歌的转译器简化了使用 FHE 驱动的应用程序的过程，而无需目前从头开始构建 FHE 所需的广泛的软件开发专业知识。这填补了软件设计人员和开发人员偶尔遇到的空白，他们希望从 FHE 的功能中受益，而不必经历那具有挑战性的学习曲线。\n\r\nDuality 公司的密码学研究高级主管兼首席科学家 Yuriy Polyakov 补充说：“我们的团队通过我们的 OpenFHE 库达成了重要的里程碑，它已迅速成为当今许多技术领导者的选择，例如谷歌。谷歌转译器为那些非 FHE 专家的应用开发者社区提供了 OpenFHE 同态加密的最新技术。”\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/09/google-uses-fully-homomorphic-open-source-duality-led-encryption-library/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：littlebirdnest 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "起初，我从未感受到我妈对于衰老的恐惧。直到大概五六年前我家重新装修房子的时候，我妈坚持要在他们卧室的厕所里装一个马桶，后来问了原因才知道，她大概是觉得以后自己老了，万一腿脚不方便了，用马桶会轻松很多。从那一刻起，我才猛然发觉这种隐秘的恐惧。\n第七次全国人口普查的的数据显示，目前中国60岁及以上的人口数量已超2.6亿，这个人数占总人数的18.7%。这就意味着，有相当一部分老人正在经历着这种关于衰老的隐秘恐惧，还会有越来越多的人陷入这种关于衰老的恐惧。\n为了回应这些恐惧，很多人可能最先想到的是“适老化改造”。当然，适老化改造是一个相当大的问题域，本文目前所要探讨的仅仅是房屋的适老化改造，特别是对现有的城镇房屋进行一些“修补性”的适老化改造。\n为什么要进行房屋适老化改造？\n我们需要先回答一个问题：为什么我们要率先对“房屋”这样一个区域进行适老化改造呢？这个问题的答案有很多。\n首先是出于目前国内养老格局的考虑。国内养老事业呈现出一种所谓的“9073”的格局。也就是说，90%左右的老年人居家养老，大约7%的老年人需要依托社区进行养老，最后3%左右的老年人将入住养老院。这意味着大多数老人会在自己的家中度过大部分的晚年时光。这几乎是最适合老人，同时也是最经济的养老方式。\n其次是出于老人活动范围的考虑。随着年龄的增长，老人的社会活动范围会逐渐缩小，老人对于居住空间的依赖程度也会越来越高。这意味着，居住环境成为老人晚年生活最重要的空间载体，居住条件的好坏将会直接影响老人的生活质量。[1]\n再次是出于老年人人体工学的考虑。据老年人人体工学的研究，在衰老过程中人体的尺寸也会发生变化。医学研究资料显示：人在28-30岁时身高最高，35-40岁之后逐渐出现衰减，70岁时身高会比年轻时减少2.5%-3%。[2]这就意味着，随着居住者年龄的增长，房屋也应该发生一些改变。\n所以，出于上述的种种原因，除了大…",

          "description": "前些日子，我给你介绍了本地使用 Stable Diffusion 人工智能绘画工具的方法（如何在你的 M1/M2 Mac 本地运行 Stable Diffusion？）。不少小伙伴们反馈说玩儿得很开心。\n\n不过也有不开心的，因为手头儿没有 M1/M2 的 Mac 电脑。\n\n是不是因为设备限制，就只能眼巴巴看着别人体验新科技成果呢？\n当然不是。人工智能技术的普及化，已经是科技发展的潮流趋势了。我今天给你介绍一个不需要安装任何应用的体验方式。而且，更好的消息是，你都不用把自己的想法翻译成英文了，直接输入中文就行。\n这是个微信小程序，叫做「盗梦师」。开发者是西湖大学蓝振忠老师团队。\n我这里给你做个演示。\n今早我看到有人分享了一段视频，是喷气式背包的实验场景。很有意思。\n\n于是我就在朋友圈发了一番感慨：\n\n有了这玩意儿，上班堵车不是事儿了。\n\n感慨之后，觉得光用文字表达不够形象，刚好就可以用「盗梦师」画出来。\n于是我打开小程序，输入了这样一段话：\n\n一个背着喷气式背包的中年人在交通拥堵的马路上轻松自在飞行\n\n这里注意你可以选择绘画的类型。我选择的是「赛博朋克」，我觉得和主题很搭。\n\n然后是选择画家风格。我对赛博朋克艺术家不了解，于是设置成为「不限定」。\n\n下面还有一个选项，是画面的长宽比例。我觉得对于展示的画作来说， 16:9 感觉上比较好。\n好了，做了这些设定后，就可以直接画了。\n\n这里需要等上几秒钟即可，比本地 M1 Mac 运行起 Stable Diffusion 来快多了。画做好了，你感觉怎么样呢？\n\n有了这样的形象画面，朋友圈里的评论一下子就丰富了起来，例如：\n\n假发套得粘的紧一点\n\n以及：\n\n当姑娘们画好了妆，做好了头发，美美的在街上走着，然后突然被人用喷气背包的风吹乱的时候，你猜她们会不会捡石头把它打下来\n\n我觉得，这些担心，都不无道理，值得背包开发商们认真记录和讨论。\n如果你感兴趣的话，直接打开微信，搜索这个小程序试试看吧。上文图中也包含了二维码可以直达。目前阶段，每天有 5 次免费创作机会。然后每分享给一位好友，双方可以获得 20 次创作额度。\n当然，我也尝试了一些其他的图画，例如中国风的「雪中山寺古钟」。\n\n雪、山都齐全了，只是寺庙在哪里？找了半天没看到，哈哈。如果你玩儿过 Stable Diffusion ，应该知道很多时候你需要多画几张，从中选择更合适的图画。所以我准备等明天有了新的额度，再用同样的文本，多画几张对比看看。\n欢迎把你的尝试结果和经验心得分享到留言区，咱们一起交流讨论。\n祝人工智能绘画愉快！\n如果你觉得本文有用，请充电。\n如果本文可能对你的朋友有帮助，请转发给他们。\n欢迎关注我的专栏「科研利器」，以便及时收到后续的更新内容。\n  \n \n延伸阅读\n\n【知识星球精选】刻意练习区的辅助线\n“没有灵魂” 的 AI 文本生成，有啥用？\n可视化卡片笔记写作？我试了最近才开放的 Heptabase\n大块的写作时间？这个时代，它是奢侈品\n互联网上的时光机器",

          "description": "小众消息的冯大辉前两天推送了一篇很有意思的文章，大概是探讨一个B站视频对微信存储机制可能存在的误解。文中提出了一个实验方法，看到做了试验可能会有奖品，我眼睛一下放光，不如就趁此机会做几个试验，好好探讨一下微信在iOS上的文件存储机制，包括：\n\n转发文件是否会占用额外的存储空间？\n从同一人处多次接收同一份文件是否会占用额外的空间？\n从不同人处多次接收同一份文件是否会占用额外的空间？\n微信和WeChat在以上这些问题上是否存在差异？\n同一台手机上的不同微信账号接收的同一文件是否占用额外存储空间？\n\n试验的环境是iOS 14.8.1、iPhone 11、微信8.0.28。首先我们删除手机上的微信重新安装。登录一个WeChat小号（小号A）。此时微信占用的空间是少的可怜的752.2MB，其中数据占244.5MB。我提前准备好了一个Ubuntu的iso镜像（880MB）。将它发送给这个小号。下载后重启手机，可以看到，微信占用的空间变成了1.77GB，其中数据占1.26GB。多出来大约1GB的空间，可能是除了文件以外的缓存、其他需要的程序和资源文件。\n接收文件前后的微信\n接下来我们正式开始实验。我们讲接收到的文件转发给三个不同的小号。重启手机，可以看到，如冯大辉所料，微信所占用的存储空间并没有增加。依然是1.77GB（数据1.26GB)。微信显然做了最基本的文件存储去重。\n所占空间没有变化\n接下来，我从另一个微信号将刚刚发送的文件再次转发给小号三遍。当我点进新发送的文件时，看到需要接受文件，我有一种不详的预感。难道微信真会重新接收一遍文件？所幸，当我点击接收文件后，文件在一瞬间就接收完成了。显然，微信也伴有服务器端的去重，在服务器上的同一份文件，在本地并不会接收多次。重启手机也可以看到，微信占用的空间并无增加。\n看似要重新接收，实际所占空间没有明显变化\n按照这个逻辑，即使是不同的人转发给我的同一份文件，应该也不会需要重复下载，或是占用额外的空间。我试着用另外两个小号（小号B、小号C）将同一份文件转发给小号A。虽然也显示需要接收文件，但同刚才一样，一瞬间就完成了接收。再次重启手机，微信所占用的空间依旧没有变化。\n不过，刚才验证的情况中，虽然是多个账号转发给一个小号，但是微信很容易在服务器端追溯到，这些文件的源头是同一个。那假如各个账号是各自上传的同一份文件，微信在服务器端是否也有去重能力呢？为此，我在另一台小米手机上登录小号B与小号C，各自发送同一份文件给小号Ａ。发送文件的时间较长。这似乎足以让人判断出，微信大概没有类似百度网盘的文件去重判断。\n然而出人意料的是，小号A还是一瞬间就完成了文件的接收。重启手机后也可以看到，微信所占用的空间并没有明显增加（总计1.83GB，数据1.32GB）。这说明至少在服务器端，微信确实能够判断出一份文件是否曾经上传过。而缺少类似网盘的秒传功能，可能是微信本身没有相关功能，也可能是Android端微信需要优化。\n实际所占空间依然只有一份文件大小\n出于好奇，我又尝试从小号B发送一份内容相同，只有文件名不同的文件，看看微信的查重是否基于文件名，或是基于文件本身。经过等待漫长的发送，如我所料，接收只在一瞬间就完成了。由此可知，微信的文件去重基于内容，并不依赖名字。\n不同文件名也不会多占用空间\n上面测试的都是同一账号下的情况。那么，同一台手机上的不同账号间又是怎样呢？我尝试在刚刚登录小号A的手机上切换了一个微信账号B。可以看到，这次转发收到的相同文件，需要重新接收下载。重启手机也能看到微信的占用空间变为3.8G（数据3.29G）。不过在这一微信账号下，同一文件仍然只需要下载保存一份，再次收到就能秒存。同时利用这个微信账号简单试了一下，我发现以上WeChat的文件存储机制对微信也同样成立。\n实打实地需要下载，所占空间也倍增了\n到这里，我们可以基本得出结论，iOS的微信文件存储去重做得还是比较令人满意的。同一账号下的同一个文件，只要内容相同，就只会在本地留存一份。未来微信团队可以努力的方向是不同账号间的文件存储去重。\n另外值得一提的是，微信大概是真的有在代码层面实现去重，而非依赖APFS的CoW特性。因为即使只占一份空间，iPhone在统计容量时也会重复计算一个文件的多次拷贝。通过多次复制粘贴同一份文件，你能很容易地复现苹果的这个Bug：\n苹果什么时候出4T iPhone？\n在我原本的设想中，我写出这篇文章后，与其拿到那500元钱，我更想获得一个与Fenng交流的机会，说服他微信是一个糟糕的产品。但转念一下，即使我做到了，也并不能改变得了微信这个产品本身，以及我们必须使用它的环境。更何况再一看那篇文章，是要证明微信没有去重才能拿到那笔钱。是我审题不细了😀\n\n如果你觉得我的这篇文章不错，也欢迎你阅读我之前有关微信的两篇文章：虎头蛇尾的《微信戒断实验》与尝试减少微信占用空间的《微微微信怎么办》。",

After issuing the update command, something didn't seem quite right; I was seeing messages along the lines of:\nW: https://updates.example.com/desktop/apt/dists/xenial/InRelease: Key is stored in legacy trusted.gpg keyring (/etc/apt/trusted.gpg), see the DEPRECATION section in apt-key(8) for details.\nTrue, it's just a warning, but still there's that scary word, deprecation, which usually means it's going away soon.

At the end of the work day, I packed up my laptop and walked out the door of our office building. Several months later, we were all still working from home. None of us had returned to our office-based workstations. In July 2020, using safety precautions, we were granted access to our workstation solely to retrieve personal items.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimates that AEB may help prevent 28,000 crashes and 12,000 injuries by 2025.\nUsing four common vehicles, AAA wanted to put AEB to the test to see how it’s progressed since first rolling out to production vehicles nearly 20 years ago.

          "description": "@xinyi_l, and we’re excited to share this macOS utility that makes our own keyboard workflow smoother!\n\nAs a cross-platform developer, I need to use lots of hotkeys containing function keys, like Shift+F12 in JetBrain tools. By default, I have to hold an extra Fn key every time to use F12, which is quite inconvenient. macOS does provide an option in Preferences that allows me to use F12 directly. However, the price is that I can no longer change volume up without the annoying Fn key 😟\n\nWhy can’t I have BOTH volume up and F12? So we think of a NEW way of interacting with function keys. When you short-press, it’s F12. And if you hold it a little longer, it becomes the volume up key 🔊\n\nOne single key is definitely much easier to use than hotkey combinations. I want this more in my everyday workflow. So Function Key Pro doesn’t stop here. You can also use a single function key to launch apps, or even simulate other hotkeys 🪄\n\nWe hope you enjoy this new way of using keyboard shortcuts, and we’d like to hear your thoughts! 🤩\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
