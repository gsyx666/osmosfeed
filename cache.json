Other people can't imagine having to learn even one. In this article, I'm going to show you how to think like a coder so that you can confidently learn any programming language you want.\nThe truth is, once you've learned how to program, the language you use becomes less of a hurdle and more of a formality. In fact, that's just one of the many reasons educators say to teach kids to code early. Regardless of how simple their introductory language may be, the logic remains the same across everything else …",

          "description": "An error boundary is an important design pattern that helps you deal with errors in your code. It helps you identify where and why an error has occurred and handle it gracefully. If you’re new to React or have never heard of it before, don’t worry. Many developers have probably come across an error boundary without knowing what it is called or how to use it. Let’s explore what this design pattern is and how we can use it in our code base.\nErrors and exceptions happen in any application. They can be caused by incorrect input, external issues, and even unexpected behavior. Before version 16, React was often criticized for its failure to handle JavaScript errors. JavaScript errors inside components used to corrupt React’s internal state and cause it to emit cryptic errors on next renders. Rea…",

          "description": "喜欢阅读漫画书吗？有 大量可用于 Linux 的漫画阅读器。\n\r\n但是，为日漫Manga量身定做的东西呢？\n\r\n我想我找到了一个适合阅读漫画的完美应用，它可以管理它们，也可以下载它们进行离线使用。我最近发现的这个应用叫做 Kommiku。\n\r\n让我提一下这个应用的主要亮点，并帮助你在 Linux 上开始使用它。\n\r\nKomikku: 一个 Linux 专用的日漫阅读器\n\r\n\n\r\nKomikku 是一个开源的日漫阅读器，且仅有 Linux 应用。\n\r\n它主要是为配合 GNOME 桌面环境而定制的，但你也可以在运行 其他桌面环境 的 Linux 发行版上使用它。\n\r\n许多 PDF 或 电子书阅读器，如 Bookworm、Calibre 和 Foliate 都支持漫画书格式。\n\r\n然而，Komikku 用户会有更多的功能，以获得阅读漫画的良好体验。\n\r\n\n\r\n例如，Komikku 可在线和离线观看日漫。此外，你可以从支持的服务器上下载它。\n\r\nKomikku 的特点\n\r\nKomikku 的一些最佳功能包括：\n\r\n\r\n从几十个支持的服务器进行在线阅读。\n\r\n离线阅读已下载的日漫。\n\r\n按类别组织你的日漫库。\n\r\n从右到左、从左到右、垂直和网络漫画阅读模式。\n\r\n几种类型的导航（键盘方向键、通过鼠标左右滑动或点击（触摸板/触摸屏）、滚轮和滑动手势（触摸板和触摸屏）。\n\r\n自动更新漫画。\n\r\n自动下载新章节。\n\r\n阅读历史。\n\r\n浅色和深色主题。\n\r\n自适应设计（能够从桌面工作站扩展到移动电话）。\n\r\n键盘快捷键。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n安装\n\r\nKomikku 可在 Flathub 上找到。因此，你可以把它安装在任何 Linux 发行版上。\n\r\n不过，你需要 在你的系统上设置 Flatpak 并启用 Flathub 仓库。\n\r\n当你在系统上设置了 Flatpak，你可以通过软件中心搜索它，或者从你的终端安装它。\n\r\n\n\r\n要使用终端安装 Komikku，请输入以下命令：\n\r\nflatpak install flathub info.febvre.Komikku\r\n\n\r\nKomikku 的原生包也可用于 Arch Linux 和 Fedora 等发行版。以下是安装它们的命令：\n\r\n对于 Arch Linux（在 AUR 中可用）：\n\r\nyay -Syu komikku\r\n\n\r\n对于 Fedora（在官方仓库中可用）：\n\r\nsudo dnf install komikku\r\n\n\r\n在其 GitLab 页面上可以查看 Komikku 的源代码以及从源代码构建它的说明。可以前往其官方网页了解更多信息。\n\r\n\r\n下载 Komikku\n\r\n\r\n总结\n\r\n我发现 Komikku 非常直观干净。我注意到在线服务器并不总是工作，经常有一些小故障，但管理离线漫画和将你的藏品分类是毫不费力的。\n\r\n所有这些都要感谢 Valéry Febvre（Komikku 的开发者），我们有了另一个有用的 Linux 应用。如果你喜欢这个应用，你可以考虑向该项目捐款。\n\r\n你使用哪种漫画书阅读器？你会尝试 Komikku 吗？请在下面的评论中告诉我你的想法。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/komikku-manga-reader/\n\r\n作者：Anuj Sharma 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "如今，Mac 应用商店正在售卖 LibreOffice。难道它不是免费的吗？我们来了解一下个中缘由。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nLibreOffice 是一个自由、开源、跨平台的办公套件。\n\r\n所以它一直是 微软 Office 的最佳免费替代品。\n\r\n如果事实的确如此, 我现在怎么会在这里讨论 LibreOffice 的购买呢？\n\r\n文档基金会计划向市场推出这个项目以筹集资金，\n\r\n如今文档基金会正在努力改进营销策略，鼓励人们支持 LibreOffice 的发展。\n\r\n当然，发布企业版是他们能做到的最好方式之一。\n\r\n但是，能否通过提供相似的服务，把这种机会扩展到终端用户呢？\n\r\n最方便的办法 是像 Mac 应用商店那样，通过专有渠道销售 LibreOffice。\n\r\n最近，文档基金会 宣布 在 Mac 应用商店销售 LibreOffice；他们是这么说的：\n\r\n\r\n跟以前的情况相比，文档基金会在 Mac 应用商店发布软件的举措是一次变革，这是一种新的市场策略：文档基金会专注于社区版的发布，而属于相关生态系统的公司专注于针对企业用户的、长期提供支持服务以及能够带来价值增值的版本。\n\r\n\r\n很多用户信赖并依靠的是自己平台的官方应用商店。因此，在他们的官方应用商店销售 LibreOffice 能起到方便用户的作用。你可以自动将 LibreOffice 更新为最新版本，而无需每次更新时下载相应的版本。\n\r\n\n\r\n为了享受从 Mac 应用商店下载 LibreOffice 的便利，你需要一次性付费购买。\n\r\n它在 Mac 应用商店的卖价是 8.99 美元。\n\r\n\r\n你仍然可以在 LibreOffice 网站 上免费下载 Mac 版 LibreOffice。\n\r\n\r\nMac 应用商店不是已经可以下载了吗？\n\r\n\n\r\n嗯，是，也不是。\n\r\nCollabora Office（基于 LibreOffice 的企业版）在 Mac 应用商店售价是 8.99 美元。\n\r\n它基于 LibreOffice，并不完全是 LibreOffice 的社区版本。所以现在，文档基金会在 Mac 应用商店推出了社区版。\n\r\n他们也在告示中提到：\n\r\n\r\n“我们感谢 Collabora 公司长期以来在 Mac 应用商店对 LibreOffice 的支持”\n\r\n- Italo Vignoli，LibreOffice 市场营销团队\n\r\n\r\n（LCTT 校注：也就是说，文档基金会在 Mac 应用商店推出的 LibreOffice 是无商业支持的社区版，和具有商业支持的、基于企业版定制的 Collabora Office 的售价一样。因此，这种行为可看作是文档基金会的某种自愿募捐方式 —— 如果不愿意捐助，你可以继续下载免费版本。）\n\r\n这笔费用对 LibreOffice 有何帮助？\n\r\n截至目前，LibreOffice 已成为一个大型开源项目。很多 Linux 发行版中默认自带 LibreOffice，这并不奇怪，一些教育机构也决定使用 LibreOffice，从而取代微软 Office。\n\r\n当然，它可能在某种意义上并不完美。但是它正在不断取得进步，能满足用户关于文档、表格或演示文稿方面的基本功能。\n\r\n所以，收取的费用将用于项目的支持工作，可以覆盖项目的维护成本和远期用于支付贡献者和文档基金会工作人员的相关费用。\n\r\n微软应用商店也会推出 LibreOffice 吗？\n\r\n\n\r\n微软应用商店现在并不直接提供 LibreOffice。\n\r\n在微软应用商店，你可以以 14.99 美元的价格购买 Collabora Office。但是，文档基金会还没有发布官方的社区版。\n\r\n还有 Allo Office，以前被称为 LibreOffice Vanilla。\n\r\n也许在它登陆 Mac 应用商店之后，他们可能会把它引入微软商店。\n\r\n💬 对于在 Mac 应用商店购买 LibreOffice，你怎么看？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/libreoffice-mac-os-store/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lkxed 译者：cool-summer-021 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "美国的《保护开源软件法案》将责成管理和预算办公室提供有关如何安全使用开源软件的说明。\n\r\n\r\n美国立法者周四提出了一项要求，美国网络安全和基础设施安全局（CISA）需创建风险框架以提高开源软件安全性的措施。为了降低依赖开源代码的系统风险，各机构将利用该框架，CISA 将决定关键基础设施所有者和运营商是否也可以自愿使用它。\n\r\n大多数系统依赖于免费提供的并由社区维护的开源软件来构建网站和应用程序；最大的用户之一是美国联邦政府。该立法由美国国土安全委员会主席兼高级成员、俄亥俄州共和党参议员 Sens. Rob Portman、R-Ohio 和 Gary Peters D-Mich 在一次听证会后提出，以回应在开源代码中发现的影响美国联邦系统和全球数百万其他系统的严重、广泛的 Log4j 漏洞。\n\r\n“这一事件对联邦系统和关键基础设施公司——包括银行、医院和公用事业公司——构成了严重威胁，美国人每天都依赖这些公司提供基本服务，”彼得斯在公告中说。“这项明智的两党立法将有助于保护开源软件，并进一步加强我们的网络安全防御，防止网络犯罪分子和外国对手对全国网络发起的不断的攻击。”\n\r\n这项《保护开源软件法》还要求美国管理和预算办公室为各机构发布关于保护开源软件的指南，在 CISA 网络安全咨询委员会中设立一个软件安全小组委员会，并要求 CISA 聘请开源软件专家协助处理网络事件。\n\r\n在此之前，Peters 和 Portman 的提议已获得美国参议院一致通过并签署成为法律，以加强州和地方政府的网络防御，并迫使关键基础设施的所有者和运营商向 CISA 报告重大网络攻击和勒索软件付款。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/09/lawmakers-proposes-a-new-bill-to-protect-open-source-software/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：littlebirdnest 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "在正式开始教程之前首先说明一下目前国行系统的状态：最新版三星云（5.2.00.5）屏蔽了OneDrive备份的入口，直接删除了相关备份软件的服务。因此要在国行系统机器上继续使用OneDrive备份需要降级三星云。如果对Samsung Pay没有需求而对同步有比较大的需求，最简单的方法是刷港版系统。本教程基于One UI 4.1，国行S20。所有需要的安装包均可在教程链接或者apkmirror网站上找到。\n在开始之前需要的准备：一个非大陆地区的三星账号，一个微软账号（需要是个人账号），一个非国行系统的三星手机（也可以是你的国行设备刷港版系统），以及一部国行系统的三星手机（操作对象）。\n第一步，绑定三星账号和微软账户。\n在非国行系统的手机上登录三星账号，然后在相册的设置里，找到云同步，点击按照提示登录微软账户。其中某些步骤容易因为网络原因卡住，不过由于我从来没遇到过，所以有需求的建议在酷安上搜索相关资料，或者全程科学网络。这一步很简单，因此不做过多阐述。\n第二步，降级三星云。\n一般来说，国行系统的三星云会被强制自动更新，因此要想使用备份需要先降级三星云。\n目前在apkmirror上找到能安装也能备份的最新版是5.1.00.13，由于版本号相比国行最新版三星云5.1.05.9更低，需要重新安装。可以现在系统里卸载三星云，再安装此版本的三星云。如果不想重新同步之前的云数据，可以使用ADB直接降级安装。代码我放在下面（为了方便输入，包名我改成了123.apk）\nadb install -r -d D:\\123.apk\n第三步，在国行设备上进行后续操作。\n登录账号之后，下载一个OneDrive，登录之前和三星账户绑定的那个微软账户。登录成功之后就可以暂时忽略这个软件。然后按照链接里的方法在手机上安装lycan，这一步是关键，否则之后的操作都无法进行。\nhttps://www.coolapk.com/feed/32708070?shareKey=YWUwNDI3ZTU5Y2FmNjMzMTVlN2M~&shareUid=964712&shareFrom=com.coolapk.app_5.0.2\n下载「创建快捷方式」这个软件\n【创建快捷方式】 ，打开之后右上角三个点勾选「也显示系统应用」，搜索三星云。点击进入三星云的活动列表，搜索「dashboard」，找到图中这个活动，然后创建一个快捷方式放在桌面。\n\n如果此时打开这个快捷方式，会进入OneDrive同步的那个页面，但是会提示三星云需要更新才能同步，如果不更新就会强制退出。所以我们需要用到lycan屏蔽这个更新提示。\n打开lycan，搜索三星云，在「服务」中将uploadtodrive两项设置成enable\n\n在「接收器」中将下图三项禁用，三项名字均带有update\n\n在「服务」中打开下图两项\n\n此时重新打开刚刚那个快捷方式，就能够正常同步了。\n成功效果如图\n\n如果之后打开三星云又提示更新，可以按照之前的方法降级三星云。不排除之后的系统更新会屏蔽这个接口的可能，只能说且用且珍惜。",

          "description": "时间切片 Time Slice 是延时摄影的静态表现形式：你通过固定机位并在特定的时间间隔内拍摄一系列照片，得到一组静态照片，然后在后期的时候按照时间顺序，取每一张照片的局部，然后拼接起来，便得到一个名为时间切片的照片。\n2022 年 7 月份在梧桐山顶拍摄了一组日落时分的延时照片，并在后期导入电脑并使用 DaVinci Resolve 合成延时视频的时候，我突然想起一个朋友在 2013 年输出的一个时间切片照片。于是也想给我这组照片制作一个时间切片。\n后期制作时间切片是一道很复杂的工程（比如，可以参考这里），随着照片数目的增多，操作步骤会越多。在正式使用 Photoshop 尝试制作时间切片之前，我就直接有个想法，要不自己实现一把？\n事实上，使用程序来实现一点都不难：给一组照片排好序后，在一个大的画布上，依次取该照片特定的区域，然后绘制到该画布的同样的区域就能实现这种效果。最开始我是在 Android 上进行这块的测试，后来很快就完成并验证了效果的可用性。后来想了下，MyerTidy 虽然目前的功能只有「整理文件」，但它实际上是可以定位为一个「批量处理」的 app。\n最后便有了 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新（暂时只有 macOS 版本）。\n此版本带来以下的变化：\n\n重新设计的带响应式布局的首页，为未来支持更多批量操作进行前置的支持\n新增各个模式的功能介绍以及效果图\n支持「延时切片」功能，正如上文所说的，可以为你制作时间切片照片。在下文会做更详细的介绍\n进行了小部分重构和性能优化\n\n在首页选择了「延时切片」后，你便可以选择一个文件夹或者一组照片了，之后会自动进行预览渲染：\n\n \n默认的效果是，根据你的文件名升序排序，从左到右，不对图片进行采样来进行绘制。\n比如你有文件名为 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg 到 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg 的 100 张图片，会使用以下顺序从左到右来绘制：\n\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_002.jpg\n…\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg\n\n效果如上。\n \n你可以点击「倒序处理」，来使用倒序的方式来从左到右绘制：\n\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_099.jpg\n…\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg\n\n效果如下：\n\n \n如果你觉得你的图片太多了，想以固定的间隔来取一部分来绘制，那么可以在「跳过合成的数目」来输入你要跳过的数目 X。也就是，每隔 X 张，只会取一张来绘制。\n\n跳过的数目为 5 的情况下，每 5 张会选择第一张来绘制。\n对于上述图片，跳过数目设定为 50 的时候（原图片总数目为 654 张）效果如下：\n\n \n最后，上述的布局方式都是「水平布局」：图片以水平方向来进行绘制。\n你可以点击「垂直布局」，来开启从上到下的绘制模式，效果如下：\n\n此外特别注意的一点是，MyerTidy 目前不支持图片自动对齐。因此如果你的图片组因为前期拍摄的原因有部分图片对不齐，那么需要你先使用 Photoshop 等工具来前期做对齐（当然，相比做时间切片来说，应该不算太困难）。如果需求强烈，那么可能会调研并加入这块的支持。\n以上便是 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新。未来会专注 macOS 下对文件和图片的「批处理」的实现，目前期望会做的下一个大功能便是对文件按照特定的规则批量重命名（比如整理番剧之类的，会很有用），也在思考是否可以加入类似「星轨合成」这样的功能。\n你可以通过 App Store 搜索 MyerTidy 来进行下载。如果你有什么想法和反馈，欢迎留言。",

          "description": "小众消息的冯大辉前两天推送了一篇很有意思的文章，大概是探讨一个B站视频对微信存储机制可能存在的误解。文中提出了一个实验方法，看到做了试验可能会有奖品，我眼睛一下放光，不如就趁此机会做几个试验，好好探讨一下微信在iOS上的文件存储机制，包括：\n\n转发文件是否会占用额外的存储空间？\n从同一人处多次接收同一份文件是否会占用额外的空间？\n从不同人处多次接收同一份文件是否会占用额外的空间？\n微信和WeChat在以上这些问题上是否存在差异？\n同一台手机上的不同微信账号接收的同一文件是否占用额外存储空间？\n\n试验的环境是iOS 14.8.1、iPhone 11、微信8.0.28。首先我们删除手机上的微信重新安装。登录一个WeChat小号（小号A）。此时微信占用的空间是少的可怜的752.2MB，其中数据占244.5MB。我提前准备好了一个Ubuntu的iso镜像（880MB）。将它发送给这个小号。下载后重启手机，可以看到，微信占用的空间变成了1.77GB，其中数据占1.26GB。多出来大约1GB的空间，可能是除了文件以外的缓存、其他需要的程序和资源文件。\n接收文件前后的微信\n接下来我们正式开始实验。我们讲接收到的文件转发给三个不同的小号。重启手机，可以看到，如冯大辉所料，微信所占用的存储空间并没有增加。依然是1.77GB（数据1.26GB)。微信显然做了最基本的文件存储去重。\n所占空间没有变化\n接下来，我从另一个微信号将刚刚发送的文件再次转发给小号三遍。当我点进新发送的文件时，看到需要接受文件，我有一种不详的预感。难道微信真会重新接收一遍文件？所幸，当我点击接收文件后，文件在一瞬间就接收完成了。显然，微信也伴有服务器端的去重，在服务器上的同一份文件，在本地并不会接收多次。重启手机也可以看到，微信占用的空间并无增加。\n看似要重新接收，实际所占空间没有明显变化\n按照这个逻辑，即使是不同的人转发给我的同一份文件，应该也不会需要重复下载，或是占用额外的空间。我试着用另外两个小号（小号B、小号C）将同一份文件转发给小号A。虽然也显示需要接收文件，但同刚才一样，一瞬间就完成了接收。再次重启手机，微信所占用的空间依旧没有变化。\n不过，刚才验证的情况中，虽然是多个账号转发给一个小号，但是微信很容易在服务器端追溯到，这些文件的源头是同一个。那假如各个账号是各自上传的同一份文件，微信在服务器端是否也有去重能力呢？为此，我在另一台小米手机上登录小号B与小号C，各自发送同一份文件给小号Ａ。发送文件的时间较长。这似乎足以让人判断出，微信大概没有类似百度网盘的文件去重判断。\n然而出人意料的是，小号A还是一瞬间就完成了文件的接收。重启手机后也可以看到，微信所占用的空间并没有明显增加（总计1.83GB，数据1.32GB）。这说明至少在服务器端，微信确实能够判断出一份文件是否曾经上传过。而缺少类似网盘的秒传功能，可能是微信本身没有相关功能，也可能是Android端微信需要优化。\n实际所占空间依然只有一份文件大小\n出于好奇，我又尝试从小号B发送一份内容相同，只有文件名不同的文件，看看微信的查重是否基于文件名，或是基于文件本身。经过等待漫长的发送，如我所料，接收只在一瞬间就完成了。由此可知，微信的文件去重基于内容，并不依赖名字。\n不同文件名也不会多占用空间\n上面测试的都是同一账号下的情况。那么，同一台手机上的不同账号间又是怎样呢？我尝试在刚刚登录小号A的手机上切换了一个微信账号B。可以看到，这次转发收到的相同文件，需要重新接收下载。重启手机也能看到微信的占用空间变为3.8G（数据3.29G）。不过在这一微信账号下，同一文件仍然只需要下载保存一份，再次收到就能秒存。同时利用这个微信账号简单试了一下，我发现以上WeChat的文件存储机制对微信也同样成立。\n实打实地需要下载，所占空间也倍增了\n到这里，我们可以基本得出结论，iOS的微信文件存储去重做得还是比较令人满意的。同一账号下的同一个文件，只要内容相同，就只会在本地留存一份。未来微信团队可以努力的方向是不同账号间的文件存储去重。\n另外值得一提的是，微信大概是真的有在代码层面实现去重，而非依赖APFS的CoW特性。因为即使只占一份空间，iPhone在统计容量时也会重复计算一个文件的多次拷贝。通过多次复制粘贴同一份文件，你能很容易地复现苹果的这个Bug：\n苹果什么时候出4T iPhone？\n在我原本的设想中，我写出这篇文章后，与其拿到那500元钱，我更想获得一个与Fenng交流的机会，说服他微信是一个糟糕的产品。但转念一下，即使我做到了，也并不能改变得了微信这个产品本身，以及我们必须使用它的环境。更何况再一看那篇文章，是要证明微信没有去重才能拿到那笔钱。是我审题不细了😀\n\n如果你觉得我的这篇文章不错，也欢迎你阅读我之前有关微信的两篇文章：虎头蛇尾的《微信戒断实验》与尝试减少微信占用空间的《微微微信怎么办》。",

There are several interpreters out there, and in this article, I’ll take a look at a few of them.\nPrimer to interpreters\nWhen talking about the Python interpreter, it’s usually the /usr/bin/python binary being referred to.
