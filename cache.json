Hence it's essential to run the node independently.\nWhile this article is a bit short, we are in the early stages of explaining Kubernetes.

I did not want to pay 10$/mo just for that. So as any developer would do, I decided to write my own scheduler 😂. \nHere's how I did it.\nI wrote a script tweeter.js which does the following\nFetch content from a Notion database.\nPrepare the tweet\nSend it to Twitter based on the scheduled time slot\nMark the tweet as posted in Notion.\nI have hosted the scheduler in AWS and it runs as a container in ECS. \nI use Amazon EventBridge rule to create a new container every 30 minutes. This container when started executes tweeter.js and terminates. This way, I don't have a server running all the time, which in turn results in reduced costs.\nIt costs less than 1$ a month and I can schedule as many tweets/threads I want. \nOne caveat is that the tweets schedule time is not accurate to the specific minute. It depends on the frequency at which a new container is created. I have set it to 30 minutes, so if you schedule a tweet between 10:00 & 10:30 all of them would be tweeted at the same time. \nECS infrastructure setup - https://github.com/vthub/scheduled-ecs-task",

          "description": "Source of inspiration 🌟\n\n\nThere is so much to learn from Docusaurus. It is a powerful static site generator, packed with amazing features. I envision my own static site generator – rwar - to be as powerful as Docusaurus someday. But then again – I am a one-person team, the sole author of my static site generator getting occasional little help from other teammates in the class, and taking small steps to one day become as feature packed as Docusaurus. But for now, I am taking it slow, learning python as I improve rwar. \nRemember that kid that got famous on YouTube for his toy reviews. Let’s imagine we want to do the same thing – talk about toys - but instead of making videos we want to use pictures and words to tell all our friends about what we liked or disliked about our toys. So, we open…",

It’s just your standard dropdown select component made for React applications, styled to match the UI component library Chakra UI. However, it’s not entirely my own creation. Instead it’s a wrapper for the majorly popular React Select, which, for a long time, was the most starred React project on GitHub.\n\nHere are some stats showing how far the package has come:\nIt has been downloaded 1,156,328 times from NPM\n\n\nIt is curren…",

          "description": "之前，我在《论文读不懂怎么办？》一文中，给你介绍了论文阅读遇到问题时的几个解决方法。尤其是介绍了你可以求助的免费资源和路径，它们包括但不限于：\n\n幻灯\n博客\n视频\n课程\n代码\n\n那篇文章，在知乎上获得了 2600 个赞（截止 2022 年 10 月）。我相信，对于很多同学，起到了帮助。\n\n只不过，环境和技术在变化，我们解决问题的方法和思路，也应该与时俱进。\n这不，因为有了大规模自然语言处理模型的加持，阅读论文时遇到不认识的名词，或者无法理解作者的简单解释时，我们有了一种新的对策。\n具体的方法，就是人工智能替你阅读后，把内容综合整理，结合上下文转换成简单清晰的语言，再反馈给你。\n这个想法，其实并不新鲜了。翻看近几年自然语言处理领域的论文，你能看见不少相关的研究。\n只不过，那些研究成果只存在论文中，或者是在某个实验室的电脑里面，普通人根本无法接触，更不要说利用了。\n这回可不一样，有人（ \\@amanjha__ and \\@functionofjade）居然真的就做了个产品出来。\n这个应用的名字，叫做 explainpaper ，非常直白吧？\n\n使用起来也特别方便。不用去菜单里面点选找寻。只要你把论文传上去，高亮某一个词语、短语或者段落，人工智能就会自动为你解读。\n\n不仅如此，你还可以就着 AI 反馈的结果，继续追问。\n这种应用演示不大适合图文。所以我干脆为你做了 一段演示视频，你可以先看看。\n \n \n看完之后，感受如何？\n反正不少小伙伴表示，很兴奋。\n\n这东西背后的技术是啥？当然还是咱们的老熟人 ------GPT-3.\n其实 GPT-3 这模型的特点，说穿了就是大。因为模型庞大，参数众多，所以从海量语料库里积攒的「认知」就多。注意我这里刻意回避了「知识」这个词儿。\n\n（资料来源：t.ly/cY1kn）\n从上图中，你不难看到，现在的文本和代码生成中，GPT-3 都占据了重要位置。\n我喜欢共享内容的原因之一，是视频发出后总可以获得观众进一步的反馈。不少的问题，都会激发我的思考。\n例如有小伙伴在视频后面提问，说这个东西能不能帮着理解中文论文啊？\n\n这是个很好的问题。毕竟很多国内人文社科研究生平时阅读的论文，更大比例是中文的。\n我一开始觉得这个问题问得有些太贪心了。对于一个外国人做的刚上线应用，你指望人家立即支持阅读中文，还能看懂中文的研究论文，不大现实吧？\n刚要回复，我突然想起来 上次在 Lex 上面的教训了。既然 explainpaper 的底层模型是 GPT-3 ，那它本来就该认得中文啊。\n为了确保回答准确，还是实际测试一下吧。我传了一篇自己的论文上去。\n\n中文划线高亮之后，AI 反馈的结果让我有些吃惊。\n尽管 explainpaper 并不能直接用中文来解释信息。但它可以立即识别出「知识管理」就是 knowledge management ，然后进一步解释下去。\n下面这段解释，就更有意思了。\n\n它先广泛解释「插件」是啥，然后结合本文的上下文，指出 Roam Toolkit 是一种插件，并且描述了它的功能。\n不仅如此，从下图可以看出，就连划线的时候字符之间出现了空格间隔，也依然能正常识别和解释。\n\n下面，我故意找了个文中没有进行详细解释的「概念网络」，结果是这样的。\n\n我能确定，这解释里面出现的「宠物」、「猫」、「狗」啥的，肯定没在本文正文出现过。\nEvernote 这一段，让我愣住了。\n\nExplainpaper 居然是准确识别了这张表格，并且把内容总结梳理，然后用英文输出了出来。\n上述的演示，是不是回答了读者的问题呢？我觉得算不上。从需求分析来看，人家看中文论文遇到术语不清楚，自然是需要中文的解释。你再弄成英文给我，这......\n可换个角度想想，这东西帮助外国人阅读中文论文，可是再好不过了。遇到中文专业词汇，随时可以获得准确的英文解释，而且阐述还贴合论文的上下文。外国人读中文论文，将减少很多障碍。这或许可以快速提升中文论文的影响力，妙啊！\n另外，目前 explainpaper 缺乏中文解释能力，也给国内的开发者提供了发展空间。希望早日看到更多 AI 实际应用上线，帮助国人理解中文论文。\n我期待你能自己尝试一下这款在线应用。至少在目前，它是免费的。而且因为上传的都是公开发表的论文，也不存在用户隐私泄漏问题。所以可以放心大胆地尝试 ------ 特别是对于最近要写文献综述的小伙伴来说。\n欢迎你把自己测试的结果和经验心得，分享在留言区。咱们一起交流讨论。\n祝论文阅读愉快！\n如果你觉得本文有用，请充电。\n如果本文可能对你的朋友有帮助，请转发给他们。\n欢迎关注我的专栏「科研利器」，以便及时收到后续的更新内容。\n \n \n延伸阅读\n如何高效入门 Logseq ？\n互联网上的时光机器\n如何高效学 Python？\nVOSviewer 中文视频教程\n【知识星球精选】刻意练习区的辅助线",

          "description": "灵动岛是今年iPhone的热点更新。我们在早期的时候，看到了很多针对灵动岛的玩法，比如在岛的周围养宠物、用灵动岛打游戏、适配灵动岛的挖孔壁纸等。\n但是，这些玩法从系统和功能层面，并没有用到真正的“灵动岛接口”。在苹果开发者文档中，灵动岛实际上是一种“实时活动”。在某些用户需要实时关注状态变化的场景下，为用户展示信息。比如实时更新比赛数据、实时更新外卖进度、实时更新计时器、实时更新地图导航指引等等。\n如果iPhone安装了iOS 16.1系统，在iPhone 14 Pro机型上，实时活动可以在灵动岛和锁屏界面展示；而在非iPhone 14 Pro机型，则只在锁屏界面展示。\n\nOneWidget如何定位灵动岛？\n仔细阅读苹果开发者文档之后，我们发现实时活动的实现方式和小组件有非常多重叠的地方。同时，不管在锁屏界面还是“展开的”灵动岛位置，它的尺寸都很像中尺寸的桌面小组件。再者，实时活动不能够交互、也不能有动画、不能随时刷新，这些和小组件都太像了。所以，我们最终把实时活动定位成“一种特殊的小组件”。\n当我们把“灵动岛”定义为“实时展示的小组件”，那么一切就更简单了，原则上小组件能够实现的它都可以实现。只是我们需要额外思考，在锁屏和灵动岛这两个特殊的位置，用户凭什么要展开来用它。\nOneWidget怎么做灵动岛功能？\n在迭代产品的2年多时间里，OneWidget的各种类型的小组件从用户那里得到了很多不错的回馈。当我们复盘这些小组件，用户最关心的是三个关键词：实用、美观、趣味。所以，设计灵动岛这个特殊的小组件，我们应该做的也是实用、美观、趣味。另外补充一点，对于很多用户来说，美观、趣味也是一种实用价值，美观带来个性化的装饰、趣味带来功能的尝鲜探索。\n从实用和便捷角度，我们设计了“启动之岛”和“健康之岛”。\n从美观和趣味角度，我们设计了“宠物之岛”和“摆烂之岛”。\n\n如何开启灵动岛？\n如果iPhone更新到iOS 16.1以上，下载OneWidget 的3.6.0以上的版本之后，可以进入个人中心找到主入口。在灵动岛配置页面，选择需要开启的“岛屿”，当App进入后台或者切换到其他App，实时活动就已经开启在了锁屏界面和灵动岛区域。\n配置入口我们还单独设计了一些细节：会动的海平面、开启后的彩色提示框、预览效果等。\n\n宠物之岛\n用户可以在“宠物之岛”领养一个自己的电子宠物，它每天陪你玩、会饿、会困、会渴，在不同的状态下用户需要点击不同的操作。我们给宠物取了一个名字叫做“岛岛”，领养之后，在App内还会显示领养的天数。岛岛除了不同的状态，也有可能会出去玩耍，只有等他回来才能再次跟他互动。为了满足个性化，宠物“岛岛”还允许自定义颜色，现在我们支持了7种颜色的切换。\n\n启动之岛\n“启动之岛”可以允许用户添加快速启动App或者小程序的入口，常驻在锁屏界面和灵动岛里，展开之后即可点击一键直达的App。用户可以添加1~6的常用启动入口，根据添加的数量变化，图标和间距会自动调整来适应合适的布局。和锁屏小组件、桌面小组件一行，这里的启动器入口支持添加常用的App、微信支付宝的二级路径、微信和支付宝的小程序入口。\n\n摆烂之岛\n“摆烂之岛”将随机展示一些“反鸡汤”的插画和文案。这个功能为了满足“趣味性”，该卷的时候卷，该躺的时候也要好好躺。偶尔摆烂无可厚非，休息是人之常情。\n\n健康之岛\n“健康之岛”实时展示用户当天的健康数据，比如步数、运动时间、消耗能量、身高、体重等。尤其是对于每日会更新变动的数据，是可以查看更新数据的（不过目前系统刷新问题，会有较多延迟）。\n\n \n以上就是OneWidget关于灵动岛功能的思考和功能的介绍。希望帮助大家了解灵动岛，也能够帮助大家通过这些小功能体验到灵动岛（实时活动）的用法。我们将继续做好一个“装修产品”，带来更多实用、美观、有趣的功能。\n回见。",

If you want to include the commits done on 22 April 2022, replace 2022-04-22 with 2022-04-21.\nRun the following command to display commits between any two dates by a specific author only (for example, Agil):\n$ git log --oneline --since=\"2022-04-22\" \\\n--until=\"2022-04-24\" --author=\"Agil\"\n\nReporting\nGit has many advantages, and one of them is the way it enables you to gather data about your project.

Because there's essentially a two-party system of the Play and App stores, the focus is on two browsers: Google Chrome and Apple Safari (built on top of the open source Chromium and WebKit, respectively).\nI won't be covering creating desktop apps.

We see people struggling to find their data, make sense of the aggregation windows, compare datasets, etc...\n\nGrafana does not plug the gap for them, because it is mainly aimed at monitoring real-time stuff. Engineers need to interact in a much more interactive way with their test data.\n\nIn the past we solved these challenges with Marple for files. Today we bring the same UI to people using an Influx database! 🎉\n\nMarple powers up your InfluxDB, giving you\n- speed: optimised flux queries (up to 10x as fast!) \n- UX: no aggregate windows to worry about\n- engineering workflow: data exports, statistics, compare time ranges, …\n- projects: reuse plots and share interactively with your team\n\nThis makes InfluxDB + Marple a powerful combo for innovate teams.\n\n☝️ Can I try it?\n\nYes, please! This new feature is part of our free tier.\nSign up for free - no strings attached - at app.marpledata.com\nWe'd love to hear your feedback!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

And you won't notice a difference because they're all fluent in English, in your timezone, incredibly hard workers, and the top 3% of all applicants we get, so we've already filtered for quality for you. \n\nOur training process has a hands-on top-tier curriculum validated with leaders and experts in the tech industry and +800 coding hours in simulated work environments. +1,500 companies around the world hire our talent including YC companies, Google, PayPal, Auth0, JPMorgan, Microsoft, among others. \n\nHow it works?👇 \n\nmartin@soyhenry.com. Super excited to hear your feedback and answer any questions! Our whole team is here to help you succeed.\n\nLooking forward 🚀\nMartin\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

Your new wallet is Ethereum-based and compatible with other Ethereum projects). No phone number, email address, or DOB whatsoever is required upon account generation and in subsequent steps.\n- Encrypted Messenger: your conversations in 1-1 chats, private groups, and private channels are end-to-end encrypted by default, and we give you a randomly generated pseudonym.\n- Multi-Chain Crypto Wallet: if you are a crypto owner, this is what you would love. Besides multi-chain crypto management, we also offer other features such as transacting via 1-1 chats and smart swaps (i.e. DEX aggregator).\n\nAgain, we’d like to highlight that Ready is not just for crypto owners or blockchain enthusiasts. Though its technological foundation is blockchain-related (in particular, non-custodial wallets), Ready can be used easily by anyone.\n\nWe’re so excited to announce that we’ve just launched our Beta (iOS, Android) and are also running a Beta Program for public testing. You can check out our Beta version and Beta Program here. \n\nWe’d really love to see your feedback, ideas, or even bug reports. Please leave those in the in-app Ready Feedback chat or just share them as comments under this post. Every thought is much appreciated as it takes us a step closer to developing a product best suited for you and other users.\n\nFor more information about Ready, please visit https://ready.io/.\n\nThanks, and we can’t wait to hear what you think about Ready!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

It grabs the latest newsworthy headlines off of Wikipedia and displays it in a minimal UI that's free of distractions and insanely fast, which I define as 250ms or less.\n\nIn an effort to read the news even less I built a weekly digest that aggregates the daily headlines and emails it out Friday afternoon. This allows me to \"stay informed\" without falling into the trap of constantly checking the news.\n\nFinally, I found myself getting really annoyed at how slow news websites were, mainly because of all the ads they pump into their pages, so I created a speed comparison at https://legiblenews.com/speed that plugs into the Google Page Speed tools to test all major news websites. To no surprise Legible News is the fastest 🏎️💨\n\nCheck it out and if you love it, consider supporting this project by subscribing for a Plus subscription at https://legiblenews.com/plus (the daily news will always be free!)\n\n✌️📰\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
