Fortunately, it's easy to wipe your Redis cache. First, make sure you have redis-cli installed on your computer. You can do this by installing Redis, which you can learn about here.\nAfter that, it's only one command to delete all the data in your Redis cache. Note: this will delete EVERYTHING - so make sure you know what you're doing before you run this command in terminal:\nredis-cli flushall\n\nThis will delete all databases and all keys. If you only want to delete all keys from the current database, you can run the following command:\nredis-cli flushdb\n\nIf you're unsure what database you're in, you probably only have the one database - however, Redis lets us switch between databases using the following command, where index is the index of the database you want to select. By default, Redis has 16 databases, with each having a particular index numbered from 0 to 15.\nredis-cli\nselect <index>",

          "description": "一个名为 GNU LibreJS 的 Firefox 浏览器扩展程序旨在自动阻止非自由软件的大型 JavaScript 脚本。与 NoScript 相比，GNU LibreJS 的操作也类似。主要的区别特征之一是 NoScript 在默认情况下会阻止大多数 JavaScript 脚本，而 GNU LibreJS 针对的非自由软件的大型 JavaScript 脚本。\n\r\nGNU LibreJS 源于 Richard Stallman 的一篇名为《JavaScript 陷阱》的文章。Stallman 认为，运行在浏览器上的非自由软件，主要是用 JavaScript 编写的，也有用其他语言编写的。这些应用程序有许多是专有软件或者不开源的，更有甚者其中不乏一些有害的或有问题的程序。Stallman 声称 Google 文档使用的 JavaScript 程序的大小为半兆字节。它是压缩过的，想要理解和分析这样的程序就很具有挑战性。Stallman 将监控用户的 JavaScript 代码称为恶意软件。\n\r\nStallman 建议不要运行那些复杂的或非常消耗处理能力的 JavaScript。从外部页面加载的脚本、修改 DOM 的脚本以及对 eval 的调用，都是符合上面描述的 JavaScript 代码的例子。GNU 网站发布了一个（符合上述描述的）列表。当 GNU LibreJS 安装在 Firefox 和其他兼容的浏览器中时，它会为用户做出这些区分。它会启用那些小型的 JavaScript，并阻止它认为非自由软件的大型 JavaScript 代码。\n\r\n该扩展添加了一个工具栏图标，指示页面上存在多少被阻止的 JavaScript 引用。除了更改整个网站或特定脚本或代码段状态的控件外，单击会显示接受和阻止的 JavaScript。可以将整个网站以及特定脚本或代码片段列入白名单或黑名单。扩展程序会记住之前的设置。提供了显示 JavaScript 代码的选项，以及撤销所有自定义设置或单个自定义设置的选项。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/09/gnu-librejs-for-firefox-stops-non-free-non-trivial-javascript/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：littlebirdnest 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "本指南旨在帮助你了解如何在流行的浏览器，如 Firefox、谷歌 Chrome、Chromium 和微软 Edge 中启用深色模式。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n我们都喜欢深色模式。许多人喜欢它，而不是标准的浅色模式。虽然许多桌面应用提供了原生的深色模式，但一些应用通过桌面环境的基础模式适应深色模式。\n\r\n你不能否认，我们都在浏览器上花了好多时间。我们很少使用桌面应用（除非你是在工作，如视频编辑等）。因此，当你在浏览器上花很多时间阅读和学习时，你应该也可以选择深色模式。但是，对于各个浏览器，稍微有点不同。\n\r\n本指南为你提供简单的步骤，你可以按照这些步骤在 Mozilla Firefox、Chromium、Chrome 和 Edge 浏览器中启用深色模式。\n\r\n在浏览器中启用深色模式\n\r\n在 Firefox 中启用深色模式\n\r\n打开 Firefox ，点击右上角的设置菜单。\n\r\n点击 “设置Settings > 扩展和主题Extension and Themes”。\n\r\n选择“深色主题Dark Theme”并点击“启用enable”。然后你应该看到深色模式被应用到 Firefox。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n要恢复它，按照同样的步骤，选择浅色主题。\n\r\nChromium 和 Chrome 的深色模式\n\r\nChromium 或 Chrome 默认不预装任何深色主题。因此，你需要去 Chrome 商店，下载任何你想要的深色主题。在本指南中，我将推荐 “Morpheon Dark” 主题，它有超过一百万用户在使用它。\n\r\n从 Chromium 浏览器中打开 Morpheon Dark 主题页面（从以下链接）。\n\r\n\r\nChrome 网络商店中的 Morpheon Dark 主题\n\r\n\r\n点击“添加到 ChromeAdd To Chrome” 按钮。它应该会在 Chrome 中启用。\n\r\n你可能想探索 Chrome 网络商店中的其他黑白或深色主题。请访问此页面，查看所有的深色主题集合 。\n\r\n然而，你应该记住一件事：这个主题不会改变设置或上下文菜单。这很明显。因为它只是改变了浏览器窗口，而那些菜单是操作系统本身的一部分（有时）。\n\r\n\n\r\n对 Google Chrome 也要按照同样的步骤进行。\n\r\nEdge 浏览器的深色模式\n\r\n然而，微软 Edge 浏览器 默认带有更好的深色主题。它允许你从设置中使用 GTK+、浅色和深色模式。\n\r\n打开 Edge 浏览器\n\r\n点击右上角的三个小圆点。\n\r\n进入“外观Appearance”，选择“深色Dark”。这就完成了。\n\r\n这个 Edge 的深色主题实现得更好，因为它改变了上下文菜单和地址栏。\n\r\n\n\r\n结束语\n\r\n如果你是一个高级用户，你可能不需要这个指南。你可以搞清楚。\n\r\n但我们为所有的读者涵盖了所有从基础到高级的教程。许多新的 Linux 用户可能也不知道如何在浏览器中启用深色模式。\n\r\n因此，话虽如此，我希望这能帮助你和其他人。如果你遇到任何麻烦，请在下面的评论栏里告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/dark-mode-browser/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "经过两年的发展，自由开源的照片编辑器 PhotoDemon 的作者已推出了 PhotoDemon 9.0。新版本增强了用户界面，内置了对 Adobe Photoshop 插件的支持，支持了新的图像格式，减少了资源使用等等。根据用户在 “工具Tools > 选项Options > 更新Updates” 下的设置，已经安装了 PhotoDemon 9.0 可以自动收到更新推送。你也可以选择通过 “帮助Help > 检查更新Check for Updates” 手动更新。\n\r\nPhotoDemon 这个便携程序提供压缩包下载。解压到系统，就能启动这个照片编辑器。可能最新版本会让Windows 可能会发出 SmartScreen 警告，VirusTotal 上的两个不太知名的杀毒软件也会报毒（以上都是误报）。新的 PhotoDemon 消耗的资源比以前的版本少，这是它的优点之一。例如，它在冷启动后使用的内存也比以前的版本少 12%。\n\r\n用过老版本的用户切换到新版本可能会立即注意到新的界面。比如大多数选项现在都以弹出的方式显示，最常用的工具显示在工具栏上。根据作者的说法，新的用户界面使用了“旧版本不到一半的垂直空间”，而且不会牺牲功能。\n\r\n用户界面仍然可以适配各种显示分辨率，包括 1024×768 这样的传统分辨率。且新版本中打开的照片会有更多空间。在早期的版本中，照片编辑器的选择工具表现出色。最新版本中包含对多选区的支持。添加选区、减去选区和相交选区可用于组合选择，即使在多个选区处于活动状态时，你仍然能编辑刚创建的选区。\n\r\n内容填充工具，通常称为智能对象移除或涂抹，是另一个新功能。要使用它，用户可以选择 “编辑Edit > 内容填充Content-aware fill” 或 “选择Select > 修复选区Heal selected region”。虽然该工具是自主操作的，也能个性化一些设置和选项。该功能既不需要人工智能也不需要互联网连接。事实上，正因为如此，如果多次运行该工具可能会带来更好的图片。\n\r\nPhotoDemon 9.0 支持新的图像格式。新版本提供 PSP 图片、AVIF 和动画 WebP 图像的导入和导出功能。尽管有 AVIF 支持，但由于其大小，并未内置必要的编码器和解码器应用程序。用户首次加载或保存 AVIF 文件时会下载必要的数据。现在可以导入 XCF（GIMP）、SVG 和 SVGZ 格式的图像。\n\r\n最后但同样重要的是，PhotoDemon 9.0 支持无损 “quite OK”（QOI）照片、Symbian 图像（MBM 和 AIF）、漫画书档案（CBZ）和无损 JPEG（JPEG-LS）图像。作者称最新版本中的自动优化 GIF 的功能是同类产品中最佳的。新的神经网络颜色量化器也有助于依赖调色板的图像格式。\n\r\nPhotoDemon 9.0 的新增增强功能包括：\n\r\n\r\n图像调整器提供了 12 种复杂的重采样技术的实时交互式预览。\n\r\n支持内置的 Adobe Photoshop 插件（8bf）。\n\r\n完全支持 3D LUT（三维查找表）。\n\r\n新效果包括渐变流、凹凸贴图、Droste 和 Truchet 贴图。\n\r\n改进了结晶和染色玻璃的工具。\n\r\n一种新的去雾工具，用于恢复“被雾霾或雾霾破坏”的照片。\n\r\n新的用户界面和改进的工具性能曲线。\n\r\n为了“更好地匹配 Photoshop 的实现”，照片滤镜工具已经过重新设计。\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/09/open-source-photo-editor-photodemon-9-0-is-now-available/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：littlebirdnest 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "树莓派操作系统更新，增加了对 NetworkManager 支持以及新的操作快捷方式。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n如果你是小型迷你计算机的狂热粉丝的话，你可能知道树莓派可以用作成熟的桌面计算机使用。此外，它也是支持各种电子/物联网项目的核心组件。\n\r\n虽然许多 Linux 发行版为树莓派提供了镜像文件，但树莓派基金会仍然提供了其官方操作系统，即 树莓派操作系统Raspberry Pi OS。\n\r\n顺便说一句，树莓派操作系统是基于 Debian 的。具体来说，当前版本是基于 Debian 11 Bullseye 的，它是采用 LXDE 作为桌面应用环境的轻量级操作系统。\n\r\n树莓派操作系统：带来了什么最新内容？\n\r\n尽管这个最新的更新并不是一个重大更新，但它仍然带来了一些有用的补充。如果你把树莓派用作桌面计算机来使用，你一定会欢迎它的。\n\r\n让我们来看看新版本提供了什么。\n\r\n主菜单的快速搜索功能\n\r\n虽然 Windows 系统和许多 Linux 发行版已经包含了这个基本功能，但树莓派操作系统之前一直没有这个功能。\n\r\n用户可以点击“树莓派”图标或键盘上的默认主机键，打开主菜单，键入要启动的应用程序的名称，就会自动出现一个新的搜索框。\n\r\n可用向上和向下箭头键来浏览菜单，用回车键选择应用。\n\r\n\n\r\n如果用户不键入任何内容，则主菜单的功能与点击“树莓派”图标以显示应用程序时的功能完全相同。\n\r\n再也不需要用鼠标光标来打开应用程序了。\n\r\n全新的键盘操作快捷方式\n\r\n就像主菜单一样，你还可以通过键盘打开 Wi-Fi 和切换蓝牙功能。\n\r\n按下 Ctrl+Alt+W 将打开 Wi-Fi 菜单，而 Ctrl+Alt+B 是用于蓝牙的。\n\r\n增强型音频输入控制\n\r\n任务栏现在将为输入和输出设备显示两个单独的图标，而不是单个默认音量图标。\n\r\n\n\r\n每当连接音频输入设备时，扬声器图标旁边也会弹出一个麦克风图标。此外，如果连接了多个音频输入设备，用户可以右键单击该图标从列表中选择设备，而左键单击将显示音量控制滑块。\n\r\n支持 NetworkManager\n\r\nNetworkManager 是许多 Linux 发行版用来处理网络功能的流行的守护程序。它包括许多功能，可帮助用户相应地调整和配置网络设置。\n\r\n如果你想进一步了解，请在此处了解有关 Linux 中守护程序的更多信息：\n\r\n\r\n什么是 Linux 中的守护进程？为什么使用它们？\n\r\n\r\n就其功能而言，引入了对 NetworkManager 的初步支持，以作为 dhcpcd 的替代选项。这意味着用户可以轻松管理 VPN 连接，而不会有太多麻烦，甚至可以将树莓派配置为一个 Wi-Fi 接入点。\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n请注意，NetworkManager 的支持应该还在测试中。为了获得稳定的网络体验，建议用户继续使用 dhcpcd。\n\r\n如果你仍然想尝试 NetworkManager，则需要遵循一些高级步骤。但可以放心，如果在使用 NetworkManager 时遇到任何问题，可以选择切换回 dhcpcd。\n\r\n\r\n如果你想了解有关该版本的更多信息，官方发行说明 包括了更多详细信息。\n\r\n获取树莓派操作系统\n\r\n前往下面链接的官方下载页面下载新的镜像文件。\n\r\n\r\n获取树莓派操作系统\n\r\n\r\n你可以在任何系统上使用树莓派 Imager 来制作要在树莓派上使用的 microSD 卡。不管如何，你都可以单独下载树莓派操作系统文件进行设置。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/raspberry-pi-os-sep-update/\n\r\n作者：Rishabh Moharir 选题：lkxed 译者：zjsoftceo 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

The router creates a local network, and you connect your devices to it, including your computer, mobile, TV, game console, and anything else that needs to connect to the Internet or to each other. It's deceptively easy to think of this setup as there being two \"sides\" of your router: On one side there's the Internet, and on the other, your devices. That's an awful colloquial, though, because in reality there's an entire worldwide network of computers on one side of your router, and your digital life on the othe…",

Examples of Job implementations typically provide trivial scripts written directly in the manifest. In any reasonably-complex application, however, determining how to handle more-than-trivial scripts can be challenging.\nIn the past, I've tackled this problem by including my scripts in an application image. This approach works well enough, but it does have a drawback. Anytime changes are required, I'm forced to rebuild the application image to include the revisions. This is a lot of time wasted, especially when my application image takes a significant amount of time to build. This also mean…",

The customizable lock screen is fun. Removing the background of images just by holding down on a picture’s subject still hasn’t gotten old.

          "description": "Greetings Hunters!\n\nWe are proud to finally be able to share FlexPDF with you 🎉 🥳! We developed this tool to help publishers convert PDF files to responsive HTML with just a few clicks.\n\nFlexPDF's main target audience will be PDF publishers (magazines, catalogs, brochures, books, guides, etc.) that need a solution to move away from static PDF files to responsive HTML as more than 60% of readers today consume content from their mobile devices.\n\nThe Challenge:\nExisting free tools will convert PDF to HTML, but the results are usually pretty bad for a couple of very important reasons:\n\n1. the HTML code generated is cluttered and not optimized for search engines\n2. there is typically no good ways to navigate content in chapters or articles\n3. content is still absolute and not responsive, which means it breaks on mobile devices\n4. it's hard to edit or include interactive things like audio, video and animations\n5. the results are typically littered with formatting errors, missing words and broken layouts\n\nFlexPDF is Different!\nOur focus is on generating responsive HTML results that look and read great on any device, size and orientation that delivers an excellent mobile experience.\n\n1. the HTML code generated is clean and has the correct syntax \n2. content is separated into chapters/articles and navigation is built into the output including an automatically generated table of contents.\n3. content is responsive which means it looks and reads great on any device, size and orientation\n4. the output can currently be shared in three main ways. You can download the HTML, use an embed code or share a link. All 100% branded to clients.\n5. results are almost 100% error-free \n\nFlexPDF is Version 1.0\nWe are launching here on ProductHunt in hopes of getting some feedback to improve the tool even more. We hope you will find a few minutes to try it out and let us know what you think in the comments.\n\nThanks for all your support. This is a fantastic community!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

Finally, they had a strong Call To Action pointing to the follow button to attract new followers.\n\nI quickly hopped into Canva to create this, but then decided to build a free tool that allows anyone who is building in public to generate these kinds of informative banners. \n\nI hope you guys enjoy it and feedback and suggestions are always welcome!   \n\nCheers!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
