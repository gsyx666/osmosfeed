          "description": "I'm happy to tell you that the Cherrybomb version 0.7 open source tool for validating application programming interface (API) specifications is now available.\nThe tool for validating APIs can now be part of your CI pipeline, Your life will become much simpler as a result.\nCherrybomb is a comprehensive, open-source API definition that simplifies the design, construction, and consumption of application programming interfaces (APIs) for software developers. Everything from data formats and request methods to error handling and authentication is covered within the standard.\nWe wanted Cherrybomb to be simple, both to understand and to use, so we created it that way. Since the specification is mostly based on already-established standards like the JSON API and HTTP, it should be easy for developers to adapt to the new environment.\nI believe that Cherrybomb will make it simpler for developers to construct application programming interfaces (APIs) that are standardized, well-documented, and straightforward to implement. We have high hopes that Cherrybomb will emerge as the industry standard for application programming interface (API) development.\nCheck out the specifications for Cherrybomb on GitHub if you want to get started with it.",

          "description": "在 GNOME 桌面中创建自定义浅色和深色壁纸的简单指南。\n\r\n\r\nGNOME 42 将期待已久的浅色和深色主题引入了 GNOME 桌面。它还带来了浅色和深色版壁纸，当你在浅色和深色主题之间切换时，它会自动改变。\n\r\n因此，默认情况下，GNOME 会为你提供几组预配置的浅色和深色壁纸。\n\r\n但是，如果你想要在主题更改时可以自动更改的别的壁纸怎么办？\n\r\n以下是在 GNOME 中为浅色和深色主题配置和创建自定义壁纸的方法。\n\r\n如何为 GNOME 创建自定义浅色和深色壁纸\n\r\n首先，确保有两个版本的壁纸。通常，它们应该是标准的 PNG 或 JPG 图像。例如，我们在演示中使用了以下两个壁纸。\n\r\n\n\r\n但是，如果你没有合适的浅色和深色壁纸，或正在寻找更多壁纸，在本指南的末尾，我会告诉你如何获取它们或准备你自己的。\n\r\n跟着我来。\n\r\n其次，我们需要为自己创建一个模式文件。壁纸的自动更换由名为 adwaita.xml 的 XML 文件处理，该文件定义了特定的浅色和深色背景标签。因此，我们将为壁纸创建 XML 文件。\n\r\n为此，从 GitLab 复制 adwaita.xml 的内容并创建一个新的 XML 文件（链接在下面）。你应该在这个文件中看到两个标签：filename 和 filename-dark。这两个 XML 标记包含两个壁纸的完全限定路径。在这两个标签下添加图片的路径，如下所示。\n\r\n\r\n从这里下载 XML 文件 (adwaita.xml.in)\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n第三步，使用你想要的任何名称将此文件保存到 /home/YOUR_NAME/.local/share/gnome-background-properties（请将 YOUR_NAME 替换为你的用户名）。如果 gnome-background-properties 不存在，请创建它们。对此示例，我使用了 my_cool_backgrounds.xml。\n\r\n\n\r\n都准备好了。最后，打开设置并转到外观选项卡，你应该会看到选项中出现新的壁纸。\n\r\n选择你的自定义浅色和深色壁纸并享受。\n\r\n\n\r\n如何下载或制作你的动态壁纸\n\r\n你一定会想，“谁有时间去寻找和创建深浅版本的壁纸”？一些网站为你提供现成的动态壁纸，你可以轻松下载和安装。\n\r\n我推荐的一个网站是 dynamicwallpaper.club，它为 macOS 提供了一些高达 6K 的优秀高质量壁纸。你可以轻松下载它们。\n\r\n此外，如果你打算从上述网站下载，请记住该网站的图像是 heic 格式，因为该网站适用于 macOS。高效视频编码（HEIC）是 Apple 的 HEIF（高效图像文件格式）的专有版本。\n\r\n你需要一个驱动来查看和转换 Ubuntu 或 Fedora Linux 中的动态 heic 图像。那么，如何将它们转换为适用于 Linux 系统呢？打开终端并运行以下命令来安装驱动。\n\r\nUbuntu 用户：\n\r\nsudo apt install heif-gdk-pixbuf\r\n\n\r\nFedora 用户：\n\r\nsudo dnf install libheif\r\n\n\r\n仅适用于带有 KDE Plasma 的 Fedora/Ubuntu（没有此插件，Plasma 应用无法打开 heic 图像）：\n\r\nsudo apt install qt-heif-image-plugin\r\nsudo dnf install qt-heif-image-plugin\r\n\n\r\n最后，使用你喜欢的图像查看器打开 heic 图像并将其保存为 JPG/PNG。\n\r\n\n\r\n最后，别忘了在下面的评论部分告诉我你是否可以为 GNOME 创建自定义深色和浅色壁纸。\n\r\n干杯。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/custom-light-dark-wallpaper-gnome/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "现代公司的电动汽车在其车载系统使用教程上的示例密钥\n\r\n一位开发者发帖称，他想要修改汽车上的车载信息娱乐系统，他的汽车是现代公司 2021 款的“全新未来移动生活概念的电动汽车 IONIQ”。在试图找出如何为汽车更新定制固件时发现，其中用来为某些部分签名的 RSA 公钥可以在网上搜索找到。更离谱的是，正如这位开发者说的，“如果运气好的话，他们不仅留下了公钥，还留下了私钥”，它是一个常见的密钥对，出现在“使用 OpenSSL 进行 RSA 加密和解密的 C 语言示例”之类的在线教程中，在这些教程中列出了使用的示例公钥和私钥。现代公司对此没有置评。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这可真是按照教程来的，连示例的密钥对都一起学习了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nAI 被用于通过监控视频中的行人步态识别和分类行人\n\r\n据报道，马里兰大学的一个明星教授研究团队在资金的支持下，开发了一种城市监控软件，可以根据行人的独特步态特征来识别他们。然后，该算法将使用这些步态特征将行人分为“好斗”、“害羞”、“冲动”和其他性格。“这些能力将被用来预测每个行人的行为，对监视很有用”。他们在赞助方提供的视频上进行了测试，并提供了该软件的 C++ 代码库和原始数据集作为交付品。该团队还进行了“模拟大规模异质人群的有效计算模型”等类似研究。这一研究引发了对“关于机器学习研究中的严重道德问题”的关注。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Daily Beast\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：AI 究竟该用于什么地方，该如何用，这里面不仅仅是道德问题，还应该是法律问题。我只能说这么多了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n苹果公司的服务成为其收入的重要来源\n\r\n迄今为止，苹果公司已将 18 亿台设备装入世界上一些最富裕的消费者的口袋和办公桌上。现在，它正在向其他公司出售这些客户的使用权，并说服那些拥有其设备的人注册自己的订阅服务。去年，苹果的服务带来了 680 亿美元的收入，占苹果总收入的 19%。在最近一个季度，服务收入的份额甚至高达 24%。据估计，最大的一块是来自其应用商店的费用，去年的费用可能达到 250 亿美元。其次是谷歌为 iOS 中的默认搜索引擎付出的费用，2020 年付出了 100 亿美元，据估计现在接近 200 亿美元。而其广告服务今年估计是 70 亿美元。剩下的是一系列订阅服务：iCloud 存储、苹果音乐和苹果护理保险等等。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Economist\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：成功的硬件和软件带来的大量用户，其附加服务也是日进斗金。",

          "description": "研究发现所有的网络拥塞控制算法都可能是非常不公平的\n\r\n尽管在过去大约 40 年中提出了数百种控制计算机网络“拥堵”延迟的关键算法，但没有明显的赢家。一项新的研究发现，每种拥塞控制算法都无法解决“饿死”的问题，即让一些用户占据了所有的带宽，而至少有一个人基本上得不到带宽。拥塞控制算法依靠数据包的丢失和延迟作为细节来推断拥塞，并决定发送数据的速度。然而，数据包可能因为网络拥堵以外的原因而丢失和延迟 —— 这被称之为网络“抖动”。而拥塞控制算法无法区分由拥塞和抖动造成的延迟的区别，由抖动引起的延迟是不可预测的，最终会导致出现饥饿的情况。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Slashdot\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这就是算法的不公平，或许，限定在算法的层面上，并无一个完美的解决方案。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nTikTok 否认内置浏览器记录用户输入\n\r\n研究发现，流行 iOS 应用如 TikTok、Instagram、FB Messenger 和 Facebook 都支持用户在应用内打开浏览器访问第三方网站，期间会植入跟踪代码。以 TikTok 为例，它会记录用户的所有键盘输入，包括密码信用卡信息等敏感数据，以及屏幕上的每一次点击。从技术上说这相当于安装了一个键盘记录器。在这一报道发表之后，TikTok 发表声明，证实该功能存在，但 TikTok 并没有利用这些代码。TikTok 表示应用内浏览器旨在提供更好的用户体验，它植入第三方网站的 JS 代码是为了调试、排错和性能监视。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Solidot\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：植入这种第三方 SDK，即便是没启用，但是谁知道你什么时候会启用呢？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n美国绝大部分雇主正在跟踪员工的生产力\n\r\n根据《纽约时报》的调查，美国 10 个最大的私人雇主中，有 8 个正在为他们的雇员追踪生产力指标。其中一些软件测量活动时间，观察键盘停顿，甚至默默地计算击键次数。他们看到了从写电子邮件的时间到键盘活动的一切。如果员工没有达到预期的目标，就会产生影响：一个催促的通知，一个跳过的奖金，或者一个在家工作的日子被剥夺。对于在返回办公室的斗争中投降的雇主来说，这种监控是保持控制感的一种方式。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Slashdot\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这可真是“工具人”，我觉得这和用代码行数来统计程序员的绩效具有“异曲同工之妙”。",

The sudoers file, by default, has only two rules: The root user, and members of the administrative wheel group, can do practically anything using sudo.

Multiple Verge staffers who attempted to use the social media network experienced the same issue, where their main News Feed was flooded with minor posts sent to pages for artists like Lady Gaga, Nirvana, and The Beatles. As of 5:15AM ET the issue appears to have been resolved after creating three hours of chaos. \nUsers were quick to take advantage of the bug and to send memes to celebrities that they knew would be shared far and wide.

As we scaled, we started to run into issues around our process for bug reporting and feedback across our team, clients, and users. Feedback was unclear, lacked the proper technical context, and was spread across multiple apps. \n\nThis negatively affected our users, gave our clients a sub-par experience, and made our team less efficient. \n\nUp until now, we've been focused mostly on the internal use case. Teams doing QA, bug reporting, design QA etc. \n\nBut today we are launching our free end-user widget! 🚀\n\nWith the widget you can:\n\n-Enable end-users to report bugs & feedback directly from your product\n-Adjust the branding to make it feel like an extension of your product\n-Control how and when the widget appears\n-Sync your tools via our integrations (Jira, Slack, Zapier etc)\n-Tether grabs technical details for you automatically\n\nThe widget is completely free to install and get started with. No time limit. \n\nWe're so excited to help you build better products, and make your users happier by making feedback easy.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "you-tldr, PicHance, scrilys, and launched all of them here on PH!\n\nThe idea of GitTrends came from the open-source work that we do in our daily jobs. We noticed how difficult it was to see when our repositories or developers were trending. For an event that can cause such an impact on open-source work, we thought there should be a dedicated solution. So we built it!\n\nGitTrends allows you to search a database of GitHub Trending data that we collect every 5th minute. With a small fee, you can also subscribe for email alerts for a specific repository or Github username that you are interested in observing. Knowing that your watched repository or username is trending can significantly give you a burst of popularity on your repository or developer profile, which you can then take advantage of. For an open-source developer looking for work, or a small project that needs more eyes, getting on trending can be a game-changer.\n\nAs a note, we started collecting data in August 2022. We are looking for volunteers who would help us load historical data (i.e. from the BigQuery GitHub Dataset) to our database. Contact us for more details!\n\nFor the PH community only, we are launching with a 20% discount with Promo Code \"PH20\".

          "description": "@demirbyilmaz. \n\nWe started working on Colonist in 2018 because we wanted to play Catan with our family. None of the online versions were really playable, so, like any programmer would have done, we built our own! Since then, we have worked tirelessly to create the best gameplay experience possible. Over time, we have grown and improved our player experience, and at this point, it is clear that Colonist is ready to become a staple in online strategy gaming.\n\nThis is why we are proud to officially announce Ranked Mode and a Leaderboard system for Colonist! Competing in Ranked is easy:\n\n1. Navigate to https://colonist.io/ and select either “Ranked 4P” or “Ranked 1v1” \n2. Play in 10 placement games to establish your Matchmaking Ranking (MMR)\n3. After your placement games, you will be placed in matches against players with similar MMR. Fight to move your way up the leaderboard!\n\nIn the future, we plan to have prizes for top finishers and create a ladder-like league with divisions. In the meantime, we crave feedback and would love to hear about all of your experiences playing on our site. Please let us know what you think in the comments.\n\nMay your roads be long and your armies large,\nGoktug Yilmaz\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
