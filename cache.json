In technical terms, most of the voice apps perform either voice recognition or speech recognition. And while there is no big difference between the architecture and AI models that perform voice/speech recognition, they actually relate to different business tasks. So first of all, let us elaborate on the difference between them.\nVoice recognition is the ability to single out specific voices from other sounds, and identify the owner’s tone to implement security features like voice biometrics. \nSpeech recognition is mostly responsible for extracting meaningful information from the audio, recognizing the words said, and the context they are placed in.

It's a super powerful API, so happy to see this choice.\nFetch will always return a promise so we can await the result; by default, it's a cached request/results.\nLet's show you an example.\nIn our component, we can create a data fetching function that would look like this.\nasync function getData() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos');\n\n  return res.json();\n}\n\nOur component itself can then use this function like this.\nexport default async function AccountPage() {\n  const table = await getData();\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {table.map((todo) => (\n        <li key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\nAnd yep, that's it, simple.\nIt's also a great abstraction to move towards a unique concern architecture by simply making the components as small and self-sufficient as possible.\nWe also get many options around the fetch API that we can leverage, but it might be best to review them once we need them.\nThank you for reading my blog.

No matter how fast you are with the mouse, the constant switch between mouse and keyboard not only slows you down but also makes you more fatigued. I also learned touch typing very recently and however not much it did help me with my keyboard mastery. I would say knowing what to type is more important than how fast you type. \ncheck out this article where it claims we can save a month of our lifetime by using keyboard shortcuts instead of…",

          "description": "以下是如何在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版中提高笔记本和桌面的音量的方法。\n\r\n\r\n你有没有觉得你的 Ubuntu 笔记本的音量太小，尽管你把音量调到了 100%？我相信你有过。主要原因是：很明显，笔记本电脑的扬声器输出强度比大型扬声器要低。\n\r\n此外，Ubuntu 和其他发行版将默认的最大音量设置为 100%，也就是 0dB（分贝）。0dB 是最大音量的参考值。做个比较，如果你把音量设置为 -10dB，这意味着你的音量比最大的 0dB 安静。\n\r\nVLC 和一些媒体播放器允许你将音量提高到 200%。在最新的 Ubuntu 中使用一些设置，你可以将音量进一步提高。\n\r\n\r\n注意：在你尝试和使用以下方法之前，请记住，每个扬声器都有其制造商设定的硬件限制。偶尔一次，播放超过 100% 的音频是可以的。但是，连续放大到更高的分贝可能会使输出的音频失真，并且从长远来看可能会损坏你的扬声器。因此，在使用时要小心谨慎，并有所限制。\n\r\n\r\n在 Ubuntu 和其他发行版中提高扬声器音量\n\r\n对于最新的 Ubuntu 22.04 及以上版本（GNOME）\n\r\n从应用菜单中打开“设置Settings”，进入“声音Sound”标签。\n\r\n启用 “过度放大Over Amplification” 开关。在你启用的那一刻，你应该看到音量条被扩大了。\n\r\n\n\r\n现在你可以享受音量提升来听音乐了。\n\r\nFedora、Arch Linux 和其他发行版\n\r\n如果你使用带有 GNOME 的 Fedora 工作站，你将看不到上述选项，因为这是 Ubuntu 特有的设置。见下面。\n\r\n\n\r\n因此，对于任何其他 Linux 发行版（Arch、Fedora、RedHat 等）或桌面（KDE、Xfce、LXQt 等），打开终端并安装 PulseAudio 音量控制器。\n\r\nFedora、RedHat Linux、OpenSUSE 等基于 RPM 的发行版：\n\r\nsudo dnf install pavucontrol\r\n\n\r\n对于 Arch Linux、Manjaro：\n\r\nsudo pacman -S pavucontrol\r\n\n\r\n基于 Ubuntu 的非 GNOME 发行版：\n\r\nsudo apt install pavucontrol\r\n\n\r\n如何使用\n\r\n安装后，从应用菜单中打开 pavucontrol，它应该有个 &ldquoulseAudio Volume Control” 菜单项。\n\r\n\n\r\n总结\n\r\n记住，上述方法可以提高整个系统的扬声器音量。这意味着系统的声音和警报也会受到影响。所以，要记住这一点。正如我前面提到的，如果连续使用，提升扬声器音量超过 100% 可能会导致扬声器变形或损坏。\n\r\n我希望这个教程能帮助你提高系统音量。如果你遇到问题，请在评论栏里告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/boost-speaker-volume-ubuntu/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "作为一名iPhone用户，快捷指令是系统中我觉得很有趣但实际上用得不是很多的应用。\n最初对快捷指令的理解仅限于将多个操作步骤简化成一个，最直观的应用就是在功能日益繁杂的APP中实现功能的一键直达，比如疫情期间的健康码。\n但深入探究一番后，我认为快捷指令的本质其实是打破各个APP沙盒的壁垒，实现不同应用程序的能力互通，提升个人的自动化水平。\n但事情情况并不尽如人意，虽然快捷指令编辑器提供了足够强大的编辑器，但三方应用对其支持并不好，大多数APP还是尽可能期望把用户圈在自己的生态中，没有开放足够的能力出来，这也是一款生态级应用的无奈。\n想象中的快捷指令\n现在应用商店的APP已经足够多，可以帮助人们解决足够多的问题，但有时候一款应用并不能完全解决某项任务，需要多个应用配合操作，如果用户可以随意调用应用中功能并组合成自己所需要完成特定任务的能力，那么用户体验和效率都将提升到新的高度。\n想象一种场景，当我在观看自己感兴趣的外语视频时，因为语言的障碍可能不能足够理解视频内容，我需要一些辅助支持：我希望翻译软件能够帮我把外语翻译成母语，甚至希望语音合成软件将翻译后的语言读出来。孤立地看这个场景中的每个需求，都有应用能很好得实现：视频网站能够提供我感兴趣的内容，翻译软件能将语言进行较高准确度的翻译，语音合成软件能够将文字朗读出来。但是当这三个需求点分布在三个不同的APP时，用户就难以较高效率完成这个场景的任务。实际上每个APP的能力都被封锁在了自己APP里面。\n\n上面说的这个场景我自己就有，但是因为没能使用现有工具很好使用，只得自己动手做了一个插件，可以朗读B站上面带有字幕的视频，因为微软的中文语音合成做得比较好，所以先放在Edge浏览器上了，目前还只支持带外挂字幕的视频，大家感兴趣也可以使用。\n\nB站视频字幕朗读（中文同传）插件地址-> Microsoft Edge Addons\n现实中的快捷指令\n虽然当前快捷指令还不够优秀，但对于日常效率的提升还是有一定帮助的，特别是对于实现与苹果自带应用的互通。\n举个使用的例子，每天早上我会用笔记软件记录一下昨日回顾、思考以及今日的计划，对于今日计划，我希望用待办应用去跟踪计划中事项的状态，但是手动把写过的东西在另一个APP里面再写一遍实在是太过愚蠢，于是我就写了快捷指令去实现。\n\n实际使用中，只要选择对应的文本并在共享表单中点击对应的操作就可以同步到系统自带的提醒事项中，在mac上还可以添加快捷键一键实现（应该还可以通过「自动化」省去手动操作这一步）。\n当前的快捷指令有三个亮点：\n\n在快捷指令的编辑上采用图形化拖拽操作，相对于写脚本，这种操作显得更加友好，并且也可以支持自定义脚本的加入，甚至让我一度觉得学编程的第一个应用是用快捷指令写得；\n在快捷指令的运行上打通了Siri、小组件以及共享操作，特别是后者，为与三方应用的结合提供了基础的平台；\n加入了自动化功能，可以根据一定的规则直接省去了用户主动调用快捷指令这一步。\n\n但要让更多的人在更多场景下使用快捷指令，还有着一些明显的不足：\n\n上手使用上有一些门槛，官方没有详细的教程，虽然提供了一些案例，但是大多数人应该没有耐心仔细去看快捷中心中那些精选的指令是如何实现的，这点Mac上快捷指令前辈「自动操作」可能给点其启示，其中「录制」功能可以通过「我做给你看」自动识别操作中的事件；\n快捷指令的分发做得还不够，既然不是每个人都能轻松使用快捷指令，那么获取现成的快捷指令则更加重要，但快捷指令中心中精选的指令本土化、个性化做得并不好，我觉得如果能根据用户所安装的APP来个性化分发常用的快捷指令会更友好；\n三方应用的能力开放明显不足，大多数的使用场景还是围绕在苹果自带应用提供的能力，这点极大限制了快捷指令的应用场景；\n使用Siri来激活快捷指令时对于指令的识别非常差，官方有说使用快捷指令的名称就可以通过Siri调用，但实际使用时不时语音识别不出来就是调用的指令不正确；\n\n有趣的是，在WWDC2022中，我们看到苹果开始推广App Intent框架，通过为应用开发者提供更多系统级的入口曝光来吸引他们将其应用所能满足的用户意图曝光给系统，从而使得系统可以通过学习用户行为实现跨应用的能力整合。\n结语\n很多人即使生活中充满重复的事情也不会去探索提高效率方式，因为对比眼前简单的操作，去探究增进效率操作的所花费的学习努力带来的成本更加高，只是把时间线拉得足够远，才能看见效率提升所带来收益。\n自动化所存在的意义是帮助人完成任务并节省时间，虽然我们每个人都已经拥有足够多的计算设备，但我们并没有充分发挥其拥有的算力，个人的自动化仍是一个尚待开发的领域。\n期待未来的快捷指令能为个人的自动化增添更多的可能性。",

In this article, I cover some of the ways you can customize how your system puts zram to use.\nAugmented swap\nZram swap can be augmented with standard secondary storage devices. Adding some traditional swap space can be especially useful on systems with low amounts of RAM.

          "description": "@SocialBoat\n\nToday we launch SocialBoat for Women. Motivation to create this came from my mom's (@seema_jain3) fitness journey. I have seen the hardwork and struggles she put in to get fit and how it essentially transformed her life. \n\nSome critical problems that I saw -\n1. Lack of time \nMy mom used to manage the home, and this essentially made her mornings and evenings very busy. Mid day is usually too hot to workout outside and fitness centers are usually closed at this time.\n\nI would see her get up at 5am :sunny: everyday, to go for her quick 30 minute walk.\n\n2. Lack of relevant programs \nMy mom gained a lot of weight post her pregnancy, and she struggled to find any relevant programs to lose it. Most gyms had male oriented bulk up programs, and fitness classes were usually too intensive for her.\n\nShe started learning Yoga from a book, and then Pilates from YouTube videos. She tells me it took her 4 years to gain the confidence she had back in college.\n\n3. Her New Program for women \nAfter her at home transformation, she learnt jazz and hip hop dance, performed at multiple venues around the country and recently started a fitness program for women called - Yogalates. An amalgamation of yoga, pilates and dance for women.\n\nShe takes classes on zoom and more than 100 women have joined her program.\n\nScaling up the concept \nOur goal with SocialBoat is to take some of these learnings and make high quality fitness accessible to >100M women around the country.\n\n- A program one can follow from their home\n- Is accessible anytime during the day\n- Tailored to women specific needs\n- Evolves with different life stages\n\nExcited to see how people at ProductHunt find it. Please reach out to us if you have any questions or suggestions!\n\nThank you\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "@tw__ recently got into programming and so we decided to build a small project together. It was important to us that it had a manageable scope but was still useful. So we agreed to build a wishlist app that let's you organize your wishes and share them with your friends and family.\n\nThere are already dozens of apps like this out there with similar features, but we found them incredibly frustrating and confusing to use, therefore our goal was to try and build an app that works better and has a more modern look.\n\nSome highlights of the Wishbear 🐻 app:\n\n- 👤 No registration required, starting to use the app is literally just a single click of a button. Your session will be stored in your browser but you can submit your email address at any time in order to access your wishlists on other devices.\n\n- ✨ When you add a wish from a link to an online shop, the product details will be loaded for you automatically. That works for almost every shop out there, with a few exceptions that don't provide metadata or block our crawler.\n\n- 🔐 Visitors of your wishlist can mark your wishes as reserved so that nothing is given away twice.\n\nGive it a try, it's really easy to get started and we'd love to hear what you think!\n\nCheers,\nNiklas & Thomas\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

Where can we go for resources and people to help with 6- and 7-figure exits?\n\nThat’s why I launched They Got Acquired, a media company that helps entrepreneurs sell their business. \n\nWe do this by sharing stories of founders who exit, shedding light on deals that are too small to be covered in mainstream tech media but can be life-changing for founders. \n\nWe also publish reports that go deep on the metrics behind these deals — so you can see what other companies looked like when they sold, who t…",

Great for performance on production, but not during development.\n\n❌ No real-time feedback: The alternative was to switch back and forth between my browser and code editor for every class change wasn't much better, it took ages!\n\n🤔 What if the full power of Tailwind was at your disposal where you need it most: the browser?\n\nIntroducing Tailscan:\n✅ Design and build with Tailwind right within the browser\n✅ Debug visually in seconds\n✅ Discover how any Tailwind-based website is built\n\nTailscan gives you the full power of the JIT engine in the browser, on any website. Chaining variants? You got it! Arbitrary values? Sure!\n\nYou can also use your own Tailwind config, and Tailscan will support all generated classes right away!\n\nAnd once you're done building, copy the class list, element or whole section into your code editor! It's that simple!\n\nTo celebrate the launch, I've added a limited number of early bird deals.\nGrab the deal before it runs out\n\nI'd love to hear your questions, feedback and comments. Thank you very much 🙌\n\nHave a great day!\n\nErwin\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
