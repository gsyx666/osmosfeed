          "description": "在 Adobe 同意以 200 亿美元收购 Figma 两周后，开源设计项目 Penpot 背后的公司 Kaleidos 表示已筹集到 800 万美元的新资金。\n\r\n\r\n自 Adobe 透露打算向著名设计工具背后的公司 Figma 投资 200 亿美元以来，已经过去了 13 天。Penpot 是个开源替代品，当时有过一段繁荣。Penpot 现在有额外的资金来支持这种扩张。据其母公司 Kaleidos 周二称，得益于 800 万美元的资金，Penpot 的协作设计软件的开发将继续进行。该公司表示，当 Adobe 同意购买 Figma 后，其注册用户在一天内就增加了 5600%。\n\r\n为了支持不断增加的访问量，Penpot 在周末增强了托管 Web 应用程序的基础设施。据该公司称，本地部署量增加了 400%，托管 Penpot 开源代码的 GitHub 存储库的星标数出现了硅谷流行的曲棍球棒图。本轮投资由思科支持的 Decibel 牵头，投资方 Athos Capital 也参与其中。Decibel 的创始合伙人 Jon Sakoda 表示，这个时机可能看起来特别恰当，但这只是巧合，因为该协议是在 8 月中旬达成的，在大家兴趣飙升的几周前。\n\r\nAdobe 在给 CNBC 的一份声明中表示，与 Figma 相结合，该公司将“让协作创意更轻松、更顺畅，并让数百万用户更有创造力和生产力”，而且它“将加速 Figma 的创新路线图并提供访问更广泛的客户群”。\n\r\nPenpot 仍然是很难存活的企业。设计师目前可以使用 Penpot 开源软件的托管版本或免费下载。但 Penpot CEO Ruiz-Múzquiz 并不是唯一一个将 Adobe-Figma 合作伙伴关系视为重要可能性的人。在 Reddit 的 Figma 讨论板上有个帖子，标题为“如果你希望看到 Adobe Figma 交易失败，请投票。”有 400 多人投了支持。让 Figma 不属于 Adobe，这是英国设计机构 Rejiggle 的创始人 Daryl Ginn 在 Twitter 上提出的建议。\n\r\nAdobe 表示，如果收购在 2023 年按预期进行，Figma 的联合创始人兼 CEO Dylan Field 将继续领导该公司。这并不能减轻一些怀疑论者的恐惧。尼日利亚品牌设计师 Chisaokwu Joboson 在 Twitter 上的一篇的帖子收到了 3,000 多个赞，他的帖子似乎暗示，在 Adobe 的领导下，Figma 存储文件的简单性将结束，它将开始更像是一个强大的桌面应用程序，需要手动保存。\n\r\n预期中的合并也不是所有人都反对。例如，荷兰设计师 Fons Mans 在 Twitter 上表示，能够使用 Figma 同时还能够在 Photoshop 和其他程序中“处理你的照片”将是“一个梦想”。\n\r\n由于直接共享和协作编辑等功能，Figma 最初吸引了一些摆脱 Adobe Creative Cloud 工具的设计师。尽管其被宣传为竞争对手，但据报道，Adobe 的 Creative Cloud XD 在七年后每年的经常性收入仅 1500 万美元。在 Twitter Spaces 的讨论中，产品主管 Scott Belsky 表示 Adobe 致力于帮助 XD 的用户。然而，Ruiz-Múzquiz 声称，出售的时机非常有利于他的公司的发展。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/09/penpot-gains-additional-users-thanks-to-adobes-figma-purchase/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：littlebirdnest 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

Eisenhower 的一句话。画一个水平和垂直分割的方框。在列上标明“紧急”和“不紧急”，在行上标明“重要”和“不重要”。\n\r\n\n\r\n一个艾森豪威尔矩阵。（Kevin Sonney, CC BY-SA 4.0）\n\r\n你可以把待办事项上的任务放在其中一个框里。但如何知道一个任务应该放在哪里？紧迫性和重要性往往是主观的。因此，第一步就是决定什么对你来说是重要的。我的家庭（包括宠物）、工作和爱好都很重要。如果待办事项上的东西与这三件事无关，我可以立即把它放到 “不重要” 行。\n\r\n紧迫性是一个比较简单的问题。一件事需要在今天或明天完成吗？那么它可能是 “紧急的”。一件事是否有一个即将到来的最后期限，但离那个时间还有几天/几周/几个月，或者它根本就没有最后期限？当然是 “不急的”。\n\r\n现在我们可以将这些框转化为优先级。“紧急/重要” 是最高优先级（即第一优先级），需要首先完成。接下来是 “不紧急/重要”（优先级 2），然后是 “紧急/不重要”（优先级 3），最后是 “不紧急/不重要”（优先级 4 或根本没有优先级）。\n\r\n请注意，“紧急/不重要” 是第三位，而不是第二位。这是因为，人们花了很多时间在那些看似重要的事情上，只是因为它们比较紧急，实际上这些事并不是重要的。当我看到这类事项时，我会问自己一些问题。这些任务需要我具体完成吗？这些任务我可以要求其他人去做吗？它们对其他人来说是否重要和紧急？而这是否改变了它们对我的重要性？也许它们需要重新分类，或者我可以要求别人完成，并将它们从我的清单中删除。\n\r\n\n\r\n确定优先级后。（Kevin Sonney, CC BY-SA 4.0）\n\r\n对于“不紧急/不重要”框中的事项，有一个问题要问，那就是 “这些事情到底需不需要放在我的清单上？”说实话，我们经常用那些不紧急或不重要的事情来填满待办事项清单，但其实完全可以将它们从清单上删除。我知道承认 “这事永远不会完成” 是很难的，但在接受这个事实后，把这个事情从清单上删除并且不用再为它担心，是一种解脱。\n\r\n经过这一切，看着清单很容易说出：“这是我现在需要做的事情。” 然后完成它。这就是待办事项的作用：为一天提供指导和重点。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/21/1/prioritize-tasks\n\r\n作者：Kevin Sonney 选题：lujun9972 译者：Veryzzj 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "一阵秋雨过后，忽然就意识到气温的变化，于是给衣橱换季也不得不提上了日程。\n从收拾夏日衣物并分批洗涤，到把冬衣填进衣柜、不再穿的衣服送去衣物回收，一共用了三四天的时间。其中大部分时间都用在洗涤和晾晒，专门用来收拾布局的只有不到一天的时间。\n之前的每次换季都不可避免地会撞上搬家，所以正儿八经的衣橱换季还是第一次。以下就是我这次整理衣橱的心得，另有对消费和断舍离的反思，希望对你有所帮助。\n第一步：辞旧\n此处的「旧衣服」指的是夏季的衣物，还有一些不打算再穿的衣服。\n夏季出汗多，为了防止汗渍沉积，因此需要在收纳前清洗干净。如果是年初的冬夏换季，需要注意的是不能烘干的毛衣等需要更长的时间手洗、晾干，可能需要提前预留更多时间。\n第一步就是把所有冬天不准备再穿的衣服都拿出来，掏干净口袋后分门别类放进不同的洗衣袋里。我的分类依据主要是洗涤方式：只可机洗不能烘干的，以及可机洗可烘干，深浅分开，一共四筐。另外还有一个纸箱，专门用来放不准备再穿的衣物。\n \n洗涤先从至少需要过夜晾干的娇贵衣服开始，然后是可烘干的那些。中间我留了足够的时间，以确保大部分的衣服都能在差不多的时间内足够干爽，可以安心放进储藏室而不用担心发霉。\n接下来，就是把所有衣服，按照洗涤方式分类放入收纳箱。家里的教诲是「把娇贵的衣服放在最上层才不容易被压坏」，但以我对自己的了解，天气热起来的时候肯定直接从最上层拿衣服，所以在上层放好洗的普通衣物总没错；同理，冬装收纳的最上层也是轻薄的毛衣。\n这个过程中，我没有把所有洗干净的衣服都放进收纳箱，而是专门留下了许多不打算再穿的衣服。关于我的「断舍离」，会在后面有一节详细讲述。\n而收起来准备明年再穿的衣服，都和一小块檀香皂放进可密封的袋子里，明年拿出来再穿的时候，衣服上就自然染上好闻的香气了！除了檀香皂，还可以尝试樟木球、香挂，以及切成小段、放进纸袋里的线香，都是可以持续散发香气、且味道不会…",

          "description": "前言\n为了在上班前再抓紧时间享受一下旅行的快乐，我和女朋友一起去了一趟杭州和绍兴。十年前，我和父母曾经去过一次杭州和苏州，但那时正值盛夏，酷暑难耐，我的父亲出行时又是出了名的紧张和暴躁，导致少了不少游玩的乐趣，杭州在我心目中也并没有留下什么深刻的印象。在一位杭州「土著」同学的怂恿下，为了帮助杭州洗刷这个对她并不公平的心理评价，我决定再来一次杭州。\n按照这位同学说，我们这一次来得正是时候，赶上了杭州为期两周的秋天，早来了太热，晚来了太冷。\n她是没错的。九月底的杭州真的是——好舒服啊！\n除了正午那几个小时，杭州的天气这几天一直稳定在很适宜的温度，在室内和室外几乎没有温差。哪怕是上午快十二点，大晴天走在大街上也只是有丝丝暖意，如果这时候有几阵微风从西湖吹来，送上岸边荷叶清新的香气和清凉，我就会情不自禁地把手臂张开，闭上眼睛，好好感受这让人舒服得跺脚的惬意。\n因为我们这一次以休闲游为主，并没有安排很满的行程，这几天都是睡到自然醒，吃完饭中午才出门，所以行程上也安排得不是很有效率。作为一个旅行攻略太过勉强，但也确确实实享受到了放空身心的那种悠闲和惬意。\n灵隐寺\n食\n很惭愧，这一次是摆烂的行程。因为不想时间太紧张，所以并没有专门搜一些当地人才会去的苍蝇馆子，吃的都是比较常见的连锁餐厅，外婆家、新白鹿、绿茶。我这个外地人尝不出地不地道，但坐着挺舒适，味道也挺好的。我特别喜欢西湖天地那家外婆家，旁边就是西湖，吃完饭去消消食也是一流的。\n第一天晚上杭州的同学带我们去银泰附近吃了一家名为杭州酒家的餐厅。据说已经有一百年历史了。叫花鸡被一层壳包裹，需要客人颇具仪式感地亲自敲几下，而后师傅再帮忙敲开，鸡肉已经酥软无比，香味甚至渗进了骨头；熏鱼比我想象中的多汁，带着一种甜甜的味道；藕粉样子很好看，但感觉味道稍淡了些，响铃沾了不同的酱料味道很丰富。\n叫化鸡响铃\n住\n这次我们选择了在湖滨步行街附近的一家…",

          "description": "在正式开始教程之前首先说明一下目前国行系统的状态：最新版三星云（5.2.00.5）屏蔽了OneDrive备份的入口，直接删除了相关备份软件的服务。因此要在国行系统机器上继续使用OneDrive备份需要降级三星云。如果对Samsung Pay没有需求而对同步有比较大的需求，最简单的方法是刷港版系统。本教程基于One UI 4.1，国行S20。所有需要的安装包均可在教程链接或者apkmirror网站上找到。\n在开始之前需要的准备：一个非大陆地区的三星账号，一个微软账号（需要是个人账号），一个非国行系统的三星手机（也可以是你的国行设备刷港版系统），以及一部国行系统的三星手机（操作对象）。\n第一步，绑定三星账号和微软账户。\n在非国行系统的手机上登录三星账号，然后在相册的设置里，找到云同步，点击按照提示登录微软账户。其中某些步骤容易因为网络原因卡住，不过由于我从来没遇到过，所以有需求的建议在酷安上搜索相关资料，或者全程科学网络。这一步很简单，因此不做过多阐述。\n第二步，降级三星云。\n一般来说，国行系统的三星云会被强制自动更新，因此要想使用备份需要先降级三星云。\n目前在apkmirror上找到能安装也能备份的最新版是5.1.00.13，由于版本号相比国行最新版三星云5.1.05.9更低，需要重新安装。可以现在系统里卸载三星云，再安装此版本的三星云。如果不想重新同步之前的云数据，可以使用ADB直接降级安装。代码我放在下面（为了方便输入，包名我改成了123.apk）\nadb install -r -d D:\\123.apk\n第三步，在国行设备上进行后续操作。\n登录账号之后，下载一个OneDrive，登录之前和三星账户绑定的那个微软账户。登录成功之后就可以暂时忽略这个软件。然后按照链接里的方法在手机上安装lycan，这一步是关键，否则之后的操作都无法进行。\nhttps://www.coolapk.com/feed/32708070?shareKey=YWUwNDI3ZTU5Y2FmNjMzMTVlN2M~&shareUid=964712&shareFrom=com.coolapk.app_5.0.2\n下载「创建快捷方式」这个软件\n【创建快捷方式】 ，打开之后右上角三个点勾选「也显示系统应用」，搜索三星云。点击进入三星云的活动列表，搜索「dashboard」，找到图中这个活动，然后创建一个快捷方式放在桌面。\n\n如果此时打开这个快捷方式，会进入OneDrive同步的那个页面，但是会提示三星云需要更新才能同步，如果不更新就会强制退出。所以我们需要用到lycan屏蔽这个更新提示。\n打开lycan，搜索三星云，在「服务」中将uploadtodrive两项设置成enable\n\n在「接收器」中将下图三项禁用，三项名字均带有update\n\n在「服务」中打开下图两项\n\n此时重新打开刚刚那个快捷方式，就能够正常同步了。\n成功效果如图\n\n如果之后打开三星云又提示更新，可以按照之前的方法降级三星云。不排除之后的系统更新会屏蔽这个接口的可能，只能说且用且珍惜。",

          "description": "时间切片 Time Slice 是延时摄影的静态表现形式：你通过固定机位并在特定的时间间隔内拍摄一系列照片，得到一组静态照片，然后在后期的时候按照时间顺序，取每一张照片的局部，然后拼接起来，便得到一个名为时间切片的照片。\n2022 年 7 月份在梧桐山顶拍摄了一组日落时分的延时照片，并在后期导入电脑并使用 DaVinci Resolve 合成延时视频的时候，我突然想起一个朋友在 2013 年输出的一个时间切片照片。于是也想给我这组照片制作一个时间切片。\n后期制作时间切片是一道很复杂的工程（比如，可以参考这里），随着照片数目的增多，操作步骤会越多。在正式使用 Photoshop 尝试制作时间切片之前，我就直接有个想法，要不自己实现一把？\n事实上，使用程序来实现一点都不难：给一组照片排好序后，在一个大的画布上，依次取该照片特定的区域，然后绘制到该画布的同样的区域就能实现这种效果。最开始我是在 Android 上进行这块的测试，后来很快就完成并验证了效果的可用性。后来想了下，MyerTidy 虽然目前的功能只有「整理文件」，但它实际上是可以定位为一个「批量处理」的 app。\n最后便有了 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新（暂时只有 macOS 版本）。\n此版本带来以下的变化：\n\n重新设计的带响应式布局的首页，为未来支持更多批量操作进行前置的支持\n新增各个模式的功能介绍以及效果图\n支持「延时切片」功能，正如上文所说的，可以为你制作时间切片照片。在下文会做更详细的介绍\n进行了小部分重构和性能优化\n\n在首页选择了「延时切片」后，你便可以选择一个文件夹或者一组照片了，之后会自动进行预览渲染：\n\n \n默认的效果是，根据你的文件名升序排序，从左到右，不对图片进行采样来进行绘制。\n比如你有文件名为 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg 到 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg 的 100 张图片，会使用以下顺序从左到右来绘制：\n\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_002.jpg\n…\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg\n\n效果如上。\n \n你可以点击「倒序处理」，来使用倒序的方式来从左到右绘制：\n\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_099.jpg\n…\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg\n\n效果如下：\n\n \n如果你觉得你的图片太多了，想以固定的间隔来取一部分来绘制，那么可以在「跳过合成的数目」来输入你要跳过的数目 X。也就是，每隔 X 张，只会取一张来绘制。\n\n跳过的数目为 5 的情况下，每 5 张会选择第一张来绘制。\n对于上述图片，跳过数目设定为 50 的时候（原图片总数目为 654 张）效果如下：\n\n \n最后，上述的布局方式都是「水平布局」：图片以水平方向来进行绘制。\n你可以点击「垂直布局」，来开启从上到下的绘制模式，效果如下：\n\n此外特别注意的一点是，MyerTidy 目前不支持图片自动对齐。因此如果你的图片组因为前期拍摄的原因有部分图片对不齐，那么需要你先使用 Photoshop 等工具来前期做对齐（当然，相比做时间切片来说，应该不算太困难）。如果需求强烈，那么可能会调研并加入这块的支持。\n以上便是 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新。未来会专注 macOS 下对文件和图片的「批处理」的实现，目前期望会做的下一个大功能便是对文件按照特定的规则批量重命名（比如整理番剧之类的，会很有用），也在思考是否可以加入类似「星轨合成」这样的功能。\n你可以通过 App Store 搜索 MyerTidy 来进行下载。如果你有什么想法和反馈，欢迎留言。",
