          "description": "What is integration testing?\n\n\nIntegration testing can be done in a number of ways, but the most common approach is to use a \"stub\" or \"driver\" for each component that is being tested. The stubs and drivers simulate the behavior of the real components. This allows developers to test the components in isolation from each other.\nIntegration testing is typically performed after unit testing, and it can be done at various levels of granularity. For example, component level integration testing focuses on testing the interactions between individual components, while system level integration testing focuses on testing the interactions between the various subsystems of a system. Regardless of the level of granularity, integration testing is an important step in the development process that can hel…",

One neat webpack trick, however, allows us to \"emulate\" this construct right in our React app. \nWebpack's DefinePlugin injects environment variables by token replacement of process.env.SOME_ENV_VAR. The final compiled JS will not have any reference to process.env because, remember, it does not exist in the browser. So if we have something like this:\nconsole.log(process.env.SOME_ENV_VAR);\n\nwebpack will compile that to something like this:\nconsole.log('value of SOME_ENV_VAR');\n\nThis one is really just a natural side-effect of pitfall #1.

          "description": "Hello guys today i will be showing you the use of nth-child selector in CSS.\nnth-child selector can be used to select any number of elements from a group of same type of element, or with same class, etc.\nExample - Suppose we have 10 paragraphs created with \"p\" tag and we want to give every second paragraph a background color of black.So, instead of providing separate class names to all the 10 elements we can provide 1 class name to all and use that class name with nth-child to select every second paragraph in that group\n.paragraph:nth-child(2n){\nbackground-color:black;\ncolor:white;\n}\n\nIt will give a background color of black and text color of white to every second paragraph in that group having the same class name \"paragraph\"\nYou can also select the \"p\" tag directly like this\n\n\n\n\np:nth-child(2n){\nbackground-color:black;\ncolor:white;\n}\n\nIt's not a recommended approach as there will be other \"p\" tags in the webpage and it will apply the styling to all the \"p\" tags.So, better go with the class name approach.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see all the three span elements have same class name and using nth-child selector all the three span elements have different animation styling and delay.\nTHANK YOU FOR CHECKING THIS POST\nYou can contact me on -\nhttps://www.instagram.com/supremacism__shubh/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/shubham-tiwari-b7544b193/\nshubhmtiwri00@gmail.com\n^^You can help me by some donation at the link below Thank you👇👇 ^^\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/waaduheck <--\nAlso check these posts as well\nhttps://dev.to/shubhamtiwari909/js-push-and-pop-with-arrays-33a2/edit\nhttps://dev.to/shubhamtiwari909/tostring-in-js-27b\nhttps://dev.to/shubhamtiwari909/join-in-javascript-4050\nhttps://dev.to/shubhamtiwari909/going-deep-in-array-sort-js-2n90",

But as we had our dream vacation planned for 3 weeks in April, I didn't really want to look for a new job before coming back. You might say that it makes little sense and I should have been already on my notice period by that time (which is 3(!!!) months in France)), but I also wanted to see how a couple of things might or might not change.\nMy main reason to leave was mostly financial. I was not particularly dissatisfied with my salary compared to others', but this article made me realize that there are significant differences on the market. This meant a near-future change for me.

Let me put it another way. \nThe library writer is providing an API to control the inner workings. This API is going to expose all sorts of functionality. When writing a wrapping class two things are likely to happen, you expose all of the same functionality (possibly with the same function signatures) or you cut functionality and provide a simpler interface. You will not know how the public API for selenium will be broken so even your trimmed API could need to be modified to accommodate those changes.\nAn abstraction on the other hand relies not on the browser interaction but the application and that is what you page objects are providing.",

          "description": "得益于开发者们最近的贡献，在 Ubuntu 中使用自己的强调色是很简单的。\n\r\n\r\n每个 Linux 发行版都有它们默认的主题，具有各自的主色调。强调色用于在各个设置中突出主色调。通常，主色调和强调色应该形成对比和补充。\n\r\n在最近的 GNOME 桌面的更新之后，Ubuntu 桌面在 22.04 LTS 版本中引入了强调色。\n\r\n尽管如何应用它们是显而易见的，但是为了 Linux 的新手，我将解释如何在 Ubuntu 桌面中使用强调色。\n\r\n在 Ubuntu 桌面中应用强调色\n\r\n\r\n从应用菜单中打开 系统设置System Settings\n\r\n进入 外观Appearance 菜单\n\r\n在 风格Style 菜单下，你应该见到一套预设的颜色。\n\r\n选择其中的一个来改变强调色。\n\r\n\r\n一旦更改，强调色将被应用到 GTK 应用程序中的选区和 GTK 控件中，如切换按钮和文件夹的默认外观。\n\r\n默认的强调色是橙色，有十种颜色可供选择，具体如下：\n\r\n\r\n橙色\n\r\n树皮色\n\r\n鼠尾草色\n\r\n橄榄绿\n\r\n铬绿\n\r\n普鲁士绿\n\r\n蓝色\n\r\n紫色\n\r\n品红色\n\r\n红色\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n（LCTT 译注：树皮色是一种棕色，鼠尾草色是一种灰绿色。）\n\r\n你应该记住一点，深色和浅色的主题的强调色组合可能改变你的桌面的整体外观。\n\r\n以上的特性只是只适用于目前使用 GNOME 桌面的 Ubuntu，而不适用于其它提供原生 GNOME 的发行版，例如 Fedora Workstation。因为有一些内容是由 Ubuntu 团队开发的，并且并没有合并到 GNOME 上游。\n\r\nKubuntu 中的强调色\n\r\n使用带有 KDE Plasma 桌面的 Kubuntu，你可以简单地使用强调色。KDE Plasma 提供了预设的颜色，也有自定义的颜色选择器选项。另外，自 KDE Plasma 5.25 起，强调色可以根据壁纸来改变。\n\r\n为了在 Kubuntu 中改变它，跟着下面的步骤走：\n\r\n\r\n在应用菜单中打开 系统设置System Settings\n\r\n进入 外观Appearance > 全局主题Global Theme > 颜色Colours 标签\n\r\n选择你的强调色\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n我知道 Lubuntu 与 Xubuntu 并没有这个特性。而且它不太可能很快到来。\n\r\n使用愉快。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/ubuntu-accent-colour/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：yjacks 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "继 7 月的《PasteNow 2.3 发布：支持 Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴》后，PasteNow 2.4 又带来了一个非常实用的功能，即「将最近一个项目粘贴为纯文本 」。\n新特性：将最近一个项目粘贴为纯文本\n在 PasteNow 的使用场景当中，复制粘贴文本是其中最常见的一个场景，而其中又有一部分的需求是将富文本以纯文本的形式粘贴出来，或者换句话说就是：去除文本的格式。\nPasteNow 一直都有按需去除格式的功能，它可以按纯文本粘贴或原始格式（富文本）进行粘贴。不过这个过程会需要将 PasteNow 的界面唤起，并按下内置的快捷键来达到这个目标。如果需要多次处理较多的文本，处理起来就会相对比较慢了。\n于是在 2.4 版本中，针对这一场景，PasteNow 引入了一个新的快捷键，即「将最近一个项目粘贴为纯文本 」。通过设置成自己习惯的快捷键，然后就可以非常迅速地以统一的形式在任何 App 里完成文本的去格式粘贴，这个过程甚至不需要将 PasteNow 的界面呼出来！\n举个例子，比如要将一个网页富文本以纯文本形式粘贴至 Word，首先将「Option+Command+V」设置为快捷键后，接下去只需要这样操作：\n\n在 Safari 里按下 Command + C 复制一段网页文本；\n来到 Word，直接按下 Option+Command+V，那么这段网页文本就会以纯文本的形式粘贴至 Word 里面。\n\n请看视频演示：\n \n \n相信通过新增这个快捷键，PasteNow 可以又快又好地完成纯文本粘贴这一场景的需求。\nmacOS 版本及 iOS 版本的其他更新\n和以往版本一样，每个版本也会带来旧有功能的完善和修复，其他更新有：\n\n调整音效的音量大小，使与系统当前音量匹配；\n修复无法复制正在编辑的标题的问题；\n修复无法显示其他应用保存的 JPEG 格式图像的问题；\n修复 macOS 端修改列表名称后，没有同步至 iOS 端的问题；\n修复暗色模式下，在一些白色背景的剪贴板文本下无法显示标题和快捷键标识的问题。\n\n其中 iOS 版本最主要的变化是完善了对 iOS 16 的适配：\n\n修复了在 iOS 16 Beta 版本中，底部工具栏会布局错乱的问题；\n修复无法通过搜索标题找到对应项目的问题。\n\n小结\n目前 PasteNow 还有很多需求和功能有待去实现，我会继续保持节奏，将其不断完善下去。\n附：App Store 链接",

The router creates a local network, and you connect your devices to it, including your computer, mobile, TV, game console, and anything else that needs to connect to the Internet or to each other. It's deceptively easy to think of this setup as there being two \"sides\" of your router: On one side there's the Internet, and on the other, your devices. That's an awful colloquial, though, because in reality there's an entire worldwide network of computers on one side of your router, and your digital life on the othe…",

Examples of Job implementations typically provide trivial scripts written directly in the manifest. In any reasonably-complex application, however, determining how to handle more-than-trivial scripts can be challenging.\nIn the past, I've tackled this problem by including my scripts in an application image. This approach works well enough, but it does have a drawback. Anytime changes are required, I'm forced to rebuild the application image to include the revisions.

Today, it's easily possible for a single photo to be 5 MB. Accordingly, the maximum attachment size has increased to, say, 25 MB. But of course file sizes are getting bigger and bigger too, and so eventually the attachment limit will go up too.

The customization support allows Windows Terminal users to alter the appearance of tabs, the window, and even background images for the Terminal interface. Microsoft has also tweaked Windows Terminal to always use a dark theme, rather than following the Windows system theme.\nCreating themes for Windows Terminal isn’t a simple process unless you’re a developer, though. Themes are only editable using a JSON file, and they’ll appear in the theme dropdown in the settings section of Windows Terminal. Microsoft has provided some sample JSON to get people started, and you’re free to get as creative as you want with a combination of colors and background images.\nMicrosoft...\nContinue reading…",

It included a record-breaking €4.3 billion fine, which the EU’s General Court this morning reduced to €4.1 billion after announcing that it “largely confirms” the ruling. This confirmation is a serious blow for Google and strengthens the position of the EU’s antitrust advocates, who, led by Margrethe Vestager, have targeted the abuses of Big Tech. \nGoogle forced phonemakers to pre-install its apps alongside the Play Store\nThe original 2018 charge against...\nContinue reading…",

It’s 1080p rather than 4K, the same as Logitech’s classic C920 webcam. It’s going on sale this month for $129 alongside a new Bluetooth headset called the Zone Vibe 100, which will retail for $99.99. \nThe Brio 500 has a cylindrical design, with its 4-megapixel camera flanked by a pair of beamforming microphones that are designed to reduce background noise during calls.
