So, follow me for getting correct links:\nImgbb hosting:\nStep-1: Go to imgbb\nStep-2: Click to create account\n\nStep-3: You can create account with email & password. Or using any social account. I am signing in with my gmail.\n\nStep-4: After sign in you will get a page like this & then click create new album.\n\nStep-5: Now you will have a modal asking some info. Fill these info according to your need & save it. So, you will have a new album to manage your images for the current project. [You can upload images & host without creating album. But creating album is more organized for your work. Right?]\n\nStep-6: Click upload images & give the images you want to host.\n\nStep-7: After uploading image quickly you will have this page.\nupload.\n\nStep-8: In a short time, your upload will be completed. The imgbb will provide you the viewer links of images. \n\nBut if you add these links in your project as image source, then you will have error & images will not load. So, you have to choose direct links from the dropdown list.\n\nOnce you choose direct links, you will have image links like these (links with image extension .jpg/ .png etc. at the last)\n\nHurray!! Now use these links in your image source. It will surely work.\n\n=============================\npostimage hosting\npostimages. These process for hosting here almost similar like imgbb.

It automatically starts up, shuts down, and scales capacity up or down based on your application’s needs. You can use Aurora Serverless to run your most demanding production workloads with less administrative effort than with other database options. Aurora Serverless is available in two versions: Aurora Serverless v1 and Aurora Serverless v2.\nAurora Serverless v2 is a new version of Aurora Serverless that provides a new storage engine, Aurora Storage Engine (Aurora SE), and a new query engine, Aurora Query Engine (Aurora QE). Aurora Serverless v2 is a drop-in replacement for Aurora Serverless v1. You can use the same API calls and tools to manage your Aurora Serverless v2 clusters as you use …",

You can look around, make \nexperimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any \ncommits you make in thisstate without impacting any branches \nby switching back to a branch.\n\nTo really understand what is happening, we need to look inside Git.\nGit commits are immutable—meaning you can create new ones, but what’s already inside will never be changed. This is how our repository keeps data safe for us. The only way of making changes to the repository is by creating new commits.\nGit commits gives us a stable, complete history of the changes to the repository.

          "description": "作为一名iPhone用户，快捷指令是系统中我觉得很有趣但实际上用得不是很多的应用。\n最初对快捷指令的理解仅限于将多个操作步骤简化成一个，最直观的应用就是在功能日益繁杂的APP中实现功能的一键直达，比如疫情期间的健康码。\n但深入探究一番后，我认为快捷指令的本质其实是打破各个APP沙盒的壁垒，实现不同应用程序的能力互通，提升个人的自动化水平。\n但事情情况并不尽如人意，虽然快捷指令编辑器提供了足够强大的编辑器，但三方应用对其支持并不好，大多数APP还是尽可能期望把用户圈在自己的生态中，没有开放足够的能力出来，这也是一款生态级应用的无奈。\n想象中的快捷指令\n现在应用商店的APP已经足够多，可以帮助人们解决足够多的问题，但有时候一款应用并不能完全解决某项任务，需要多个应用配合操作，如果用户可以随意调用应用中功能并组合成自己所需要完成特定任务的能力，那么用户体验和效率都将提升到新的高度。\n想象一种场景，当我在观看自己感兴趣的外语视频时，因为语言的障碍可能不能足够理解视频内容，我需要一些辅助支持：我希望翻译软件能够帮我把外语翻译成母语，甚至希望语音合成软件将翻译后的语言读出来。孤立地看这个场景中的每个需求，都有应用能很好得实现：视频网站能够提供我感兴趣的内容，翻译软件能将语言进行较高准确度的翻译，语音合成软件能够将文字朗读出来。但是当这三个需求点分布在三个不同的APP时，用户就难以较高效率完成这个场景的任务。实际上每个APP的能力都被封锁在了自己APP里面。\n\n上面说的这个场景我自己就有，但是因为没能使用现有工具很好使用，只得自己动手做了一个插件，可以朗读B站上面带有字幕的视频，因为微软的中文语音合成做得比较好，所以先放在Edge浏览器上了，目前还只支持带外挂字幕的视频，大家感兴趣也可以使用。\n\nB站视频字幕朗读（中文同传）插件地址-> Microsoft Edge Addons\n现实中的快捷指令\n虽然当前快捷指令还不够优秀，但对于日常效率的提升还是有一定帮助的，特别是对于实现与苹果自带应用的互通。\n举个使用的例子，每天早上我会用笔记软件记录一下昨日回顾、思考以及今日的计划，对于今日计划，我希望用待办应用去跟踪计划中事项的状态，但是手动把写过的东西在另一个APP里面再写一遍实在是太过愚蠢，于是我就写了快捷指令去实现。\n\n实际使用中，只要选择对应的文本并在共享表单中点击对应的操作就可以同步到系统自带的提醒事项中，在mac上还可以添加快捷键一键实现（应该还可以通过「自动化」省去手动操作这一步）。\n当前的快捷指令有三个亮点：\n\n在快捷指令的编辑上采用图形化拖拽操作，相对于写脚本，这种操作显得更加友好，并且也可以支持自定义脚本的加入，甚至让我一度觉得学编程的第一个应用是用快捷指令写得；\n在快捷指令的运行上打通了Siri、小组件以及共享操作，特别是后者，为与三方应用的结合提供了基础的平台；\n加入了自动化功能，可以根据一定的规则直接省去了用户主动调用快捷指令这一步。\n\n但要让更多的人在更多场景下使用快捷指令，还有着一些明显的不足：\n\n上手使用上有一些门槛，官方没有详细的教程，虽然提供了一些案例，但是大多数人应该没有耐心仔细去看快捷中心中那些精选的指令是如何实现的，这点Mac上快捷指令前辈「自动操作」可能给点其启示，其中「录制」功能可以通过「我做给你看」自动识别操作中的事件；\n快捷指令的分发做得还不够，既然不是每个人都能轻松使用快捷指令，那么获取现成的快捷指令则更加重要，但快捷指令中心中精选的指令本土化、个性化做得并不好，我觉得如果能根据用户所安装的APP来个性化分发常用的快捷指令会更友好；\n三方应用的能力开放明显不足，大多数的使用场景还是围绕在苹果自带应用提供的能力，这点极大限制了快捷指令的应用场景；\n使用Siri来激活快捷指令时对于指令的识别非常差，官方有说使用快捷指令的名称就可以通过Siri调用，但实际使用时不时语音识别不出来就是调用的指令不正确；\n\n有趣的是，在WWDC2022中，我们看到苹果开始推广App Intent框架，通过为应用开发者提供更多系统级的入口曝光来吸引他们将其应用所能满足的用户意图曝光给系统，从而使得系统可以通过学习用户行为实现跨应用的能力整合。\n结语\n很多人即使生活中充满重复的事情也不会去探索提高效率方式，因为对比眼前简单的操作，去探究增进效率操作的所花费的学习努力带来的成本更加高，只是把时间线拉得足够远，才能看见效率提升所带来收益。\n自动化所存在的意义是帮助人完成任务并节省时间，虽然我们每个人都已经拥有足够多的计算设备，但我们并没有充分发挥其拥有的算力，个人的自动化仍是一个尚待开发的领域。\n期待未来的快捷指令能为个人的自动化增添更多的可能性。",

Most also provide a pop-up menu so you can launch an application, some provide a dock or panel so you can switch between different applications you have running.

That includes its Material Design 3 font and Google Sans Text. \n\n\nGoogle calls Gmail’s new layout the “integrated” view because it comes with options for Mail, Chat, Spaces, and Meet on the far-left sidebar. While hovering over these buttons reveals a small pop-out menu, clicking on them makes the app fill the whole screen.\nIn case you find the extra buttons distracting, you can disable Meet and Chat from your Settings menu. This saves...\nContinue reading…",

The card, known as the A800, should have the same massive computing capabilities as the original but can only communicate with other cards in a computing cluster at 400 gigabytes per second instead of 600Gbps. According to The Wall Street Journal, that means the A800 should be just as good for simple tasks but will be significantly less effective when it’s part of something like a supercomputer.\nAn unnamed Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters that the card is an “alternative product to the Nvidia A100 GPU for customers...\nContinue reading…",

In order to keep customers happy — and prevent them from going elsewhere — many retailers offer price-matching policies where they promise to match a lower price you’ve found elsewhere. That’s information that could come in handy this holiday season, especially since Black Friday and Cyber Monday are once again right around the corner. \nWhat follows are the price-matching policies for a variety of major retailers. There are a few things to make note of here. First, all price-matching policies have a number of rules attached to them. We’ve summarized some of the rules...\nContinue reading…",
