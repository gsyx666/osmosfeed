I had introduced typescript-json as a superfast runtime validator library of TypeScript based on a benchmark. However, the benchmark is only measured on my computer, so it's a bit less objective.\nIn such reason, I hope measure benchmark of typescript-json on multiple devices as a lot as possible. Especially, I'm curious about the benchmark results on CPUs other than AMD such as Intel or Apple M1/2. On AMD CPU (5800H) benchmark, typescript-json is 8,000x times faster than class-validator, but how about other CPUs?\nIf you can help me the typescript-json benchmark, pleaese fork, clone and run below commands. After running the benchmark program, a new directory would be created under typescript-json/benchmark/results following your CPU name. Check the newly generated markdown file and send PR with your new commit.\nWhe you're running benchmark on notebook, please process the benchmark program on the charging state. Also, all the benchmarked CPUs are listed up into here: typescript-json/benchmark/results.

So I went on the domain provider and search for that name but the .com domain is way much pricey🤯 (around $2500 USD) because it says that it is a premium😪 domain. \nNow the problem is that the people are habituated with the .com domain. There are plenty of domain names such as .net, .dev, .tech and I think the .dev is more suitable for the website since it is related to developers. Then one more question comes in mind about the future of the .dev domain. \nSo, What are your tips on choosing domain names when you stuck in situation like this? What should you do? Do you keep the .dev or change the website's name and use the .com? Does domain name really matters?",

          "description": "Another essential aspect of Kubernetes is storage. In some instances, you will want to use some kind of storage solution.\nBecause our pods can re-spool, die and recreate on the fly, we can't rely on storing elements on them.\nIn many cases, we want some data stored but stay there and make that data accessible across multiple pods.\nKubernetes has quite a wide variety of storage options. Let's take a closer look at them.\nVolumes are the basic storage entities in Kubernetes. It can provide all types of storage depending on your cloud provider and needs. Access to these storage volumes can be achieved through persistent volumes.\nFor example, the Azure cloud will have its implementation, as does Google and AWS.\nThis interface is used to store containers. It's a plugin making it easier for us to manage storage containers.\nThis is the default storage option for Kubernetes, consisting of non-persistent temporary storage. As long as the container keeps living, it will be there, but as soon as it dies and shuts down, it gets wiped.\nFor persistent volumes, we have two important concepts to understand.\nThis is a storage element in a cluster, defined manually or by a storage class (A way to define the type of volumes). A PV storage has its lifecycle separate from your other pods and implements its layer to communicate to your desired storage.\nThis is a user's storage request. An application can request a specific type of storage, for example, how to interact with the data. Or how big the storage should be and the level of performance.\nStorage within Kubernetes is very vast and dynamic.\nThis gives us a lot of flexibility and freedom.\nThank you for reading my blog.

          "description": "欧盟新法律可能迫使苹果公司开放其核心利益\n\r\n欧盟新的《数字市场法案》（DMA）于今天生效，进入六个月的实施阶段，将于名年 5 月 2 日开始适用。DMA 将适用于符合其 “看门人” 标准的科技巨头，并迫使他们向其他公司和开发者开放其各种服务和平台。苹果几乎可以肯定被列为“看门人”，因此将受到 DMA 的约束。这可能迫使苹果公司让用户访问第三方应用程序商店，并允许在 iPhone 和 iPad 上进行应用程序侧载，使用第三方支付系统，访问苹果收集的数据，以及提高 iMessage 互操作性等等。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Mac Rumors\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：不能不说，欧盟的这些法律极大地制裁了那些垄断巨头。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nMozilla 公布它的 Manifest V3 扩展方案\n\r\nManifest V3（MV3）是 Chrome 的新扩展规范，Chrome 将从明年 1 月开始逐步淘汰之前的 MV2 扩展。Mozilla 的 MV3 和谷歌的 MV3 之间有些区别，最重要的是没有采用谷歌的声明式网络请求（DNR），而保留了 MV2 的 WebRequest API。这也是新的扩展系统引发广泛争议的地方，广告屏蔽扩展如 uBlock Origin 使用 WebRequest 在广告下载前屏蔽其请求。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Solidot\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我觉得 Mozilla 这次做的很好。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nMeta 宣称其 AI 音频编解码器提供 10 倍于 MP3 的压缩率\n\r\n上周，Meta 公司宣布了一种名为 “EnCodec” 的人工智能驱动的音频压缩方法，据说可以将音频压缩到比 MP3 格式小 10 倍的 64kbps，而且人耳听不到质量损失。其关键是识别人类无法察觉的变化，他们使用鉴别器来提高生成的样本的感知质量，该模型通过让重建的样本与原始样本在感知上更加相似来生成样本以“欺骗”鉴别器。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Ars Technica\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：通过 AI 分析人耳不能识别的部分，从而“骗过”鉴别器，这真是一种巧妙的方法。AI 越来越做到一些人所做不到的地方。",

          "description": "Vanilla OS 是建立在 GNOME 上的、具有按需不变性和软件包选择自由的 Ubuntu。听起来很有趣？在这里阅读更多信息。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n这正是我第一次接触 Vanilla OS 时的想法。\n\r\n当 Bottles 的创建者 Mirko Brombin 在 Twitter 上宣布它时，让我对它产生了兴趣 😎。\n\r\n我加入了他们的 Discord 频道并成为了一名测试者。虽然我没有做出什么贡献，但关注项目发展是很有趣的。\n\r\n回到至关重要的问题上：什么是 Vanilla OS？\n\r\nVanilla OS 的目标是提供一个干净、原味的 GNOME 体验，并具有按需不变性的能力。\n\r\n听起来很有趣？让我告诉你我试了试它的第一个开放测试版本后的一些细节。\n\r\n\r\n💡 Vanilla OS 计划在 11 月有一个稳定的版本。\n\r\n它将跟随 Ubuntu 的小版本发布。\n\r\n因此，你可以期待每年发布两个版本。例如，你可以从 Ubuntu 22.04 升级到 Ubuntu 22.10 甚至更之后的版本。\n\r\n除非你知道自己在做什么，否则你不应该把它作为日常系统来使用。\n\r\n\r\nVanilla OS：又一个基于 Ubuntu 的发行版？\n\r\n\n\r\n是，也不是。\n\r\n对于初学者来说，我认为有以下独特的理由可以尝试一下：\n\r\n\r\n在 Ubuntu 之上获得 原装 GNOME 体验。（Fedora 也是一个很好的选择，但并不适合所有人！）\n\r\n在其安装后的首次设置时，允许你选择并启用 Flatpak/Snap/AppImage。\n\r\n按需不变性，意味着你可以使系统变成只读，以防止来自第三方应用程序和更新的关键变化。\n\r\n一个新的软件包管理器（apx）允许你默认在管理的容器内安装软件包。\n\r\n\r\n首次设置过程的体验很轻松。\n\r\n\r\nℹ️ 目前，它使用 Calamares 安装程序。他们打算用 Crystal Linux 中使用的 Jade 取代它。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n越来越多的发行版投身于此；我相信更多的用户会乐意加入到 Linux 中来。\n\r\n\n\r\nVanilla OS 对软件包管理器的选择\n\r\n当然，像 Ubuntu MATE 和 Pop!_OS 这样的发行版已经付出了巨大的努力，而 Vanilla OS 也为此增加了一些改进。\n\r\n\n\r\n这看起来是一种漂亮的体验！😊\n\r\n一旦你完成了首次设置，你就没有什么可担心的了。你会得到通常的 GNOME 桌面，以及由 Patrik Kramolis 制作的漂亮的壁纸。\n\r\n\n\r\n接下来，我试着检查了按需不变性，你可以用以下命令查看和调整：\n\r\n\n\r\n你可以在 GitHub 上了解更多这个（基本上）使之成为可能的工具。\n\r\n接下来，看看新的软件包管理器，我喜欢 Distrobox 的底层概念，使其与 apx 成为可能。\n\r\nDistrobox 的创建者 Luca di Maio 也参与了 Vanilla OS 的开发。\n\r\n不过，当用 apx 安装一个软件包时，你需要用命令来初始化容器：\n\r\napx init\r\n\n\r\n如果它能自动完成，那就更直观了。\n\r\n\n\r\n当然，我不知道技术上的限制。但是，对于用户端来说会感觉更顺滑！\n\r\n总的来说，一个利用容器安装应用程序的软件包管理器、获得选择你的软件包管理器的能力、按需不变性，以及原味的 GNOME 使它看起来是一个值得关注的好东西。\n\r\n前面的路：第一印象\n\r\n我觉得，一旦它进入稳定版，它就会成为我的日常使用系统。\n\r\n原因是：我总是喜欢原装的 GNOME 体验，而且不需要处理 Fedora 的定期升级。\n\r\n当然，等我使用了稳定版之后，我可以给你写一篇整体的用户体验评判。\n\r\n在那之前，我想说这是一个我相信很多用户都会喜欢的项目 👏。\n\r\n目前，你可以通过加入其 Discord 频道来下载 ISO。该 ISO 还没有公开向所有人提供。如果你感兴趣，可以看看它的 文档。\n\r\n\r\nVanilla OS\n\r\n\r\n然而，按照路线图，他们计划很快就会有一个候选版本。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/vanilla-os-beta/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lkxed 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

Clauser) 和安东·泽林格 (Anton Zeilinger)，以表彰他们 「进行了纠缠光子的实验，确立了对贝尔不等式的不成立并开创了量子信息科学」。阿兰·阿斯佩克特、约翰·克劳瑟和安东·泽林格分别利用处于相互纠缠的量子态进行了突破性的实验。在这种情况下，两个粒子即使被分开也表现得如同一个整体。他们的成果为基于量子信息的新技术扫清了道路。\n—— 摘自诺贝尔物理学奖官方新闻稿\n\n说实话，在诺贝尔奖委员会正式宣布量子纠缠相关的成果获奖后，我立刻就意识到，互联网上很快就会充斥着各种针对量子纠缠以及量子世界的神秘性相关的科普。这些科普，无论是原创的还是东拼西凑的，无论是专家学者起草的还是各路内容流水线上生产的，都有一个共同的特征：它们往往都喜欢强化量子物理的神秘性和不可理解。\n我承认，历史上确实有这么一段时间，即使是 20 世纪初期那些鼎鼎大名的物理学家，都曾为量子相关的物理现象感到困惑。然而，经过一百多年的发展，量子物理的诸多核心概念早就被一代又一代的物理学家里里外外地玩了个遍，以至于许多被科普作家渲染得神乎其神的概念，现正躺在物理系本科生的必修课教材里。\n当然，量子力学有它反直觉的地方。但是，现实生活中反直觉的事情还少吗？反直觉并不意味着神秘或不可理解。它只是需要你屏蔽你的许多生活常识，用绝对的理性来思考问题。所以，这篇文章会和你读过的绝大部分科普不同，我不会把量子…",

          "description": "之前，我在《论文读不懂怎么办？》一文中，给你介绍了论文阅读遇到问题时的几个解决方法。尤其是介绍了你可以求助的免费资源和路径，它们包括但不限于：\n\n幻灯\n博客\n视频\n课程\n代码\n\n那篇文章，在知乎上获得了 2600 个赞（截止 2022 年 10 月）。我相信，对于很多同学，起到了帮助。\n\n只不过，环境和技术在变化，我们解决问题的方法和思路，也应该与时俱进。\n这不，因为有了大规模自然语言处理模型的加持，阅读论文时遇到不认识的名词，或者无法理解作者的简单解释时，我们有了一种新的对策。\n具体的方法，就是人工智能替你阅读后，把内容综合整理，结合上下文转换成简单清晰的语言，再反馈给你。\n这个想法，其实并不新鲜了。翻看近几年自然语言处理领域的论文，你能看见不少相关的研究。\n只不过，那些研究成果只存在论文中，或者是在某个实验室的电脑里面，普通人根本无法接触，更不要说利用了。\n这回可不一样，有人（ \\@amanjha__ and \\@functionofjade）居然真的就做了个产品出来。\n这个应用的名字，叫做 explainpaper ，非常直白吧？\n\n使用起来也特别方便。不用去菜单里面点选找寻。只要你把论文传上去，高亮某一个词语、短语或者段落，人工智能就会自动为你解读。\n\n不仅如此，你还可以就着 AI 反馈的结果，继续追问。\n这种应用演示不大适合图文。所以我干脆为你做了 一段演示视频，你可以先看看。\n \n \n看完之后，感受如何？\n反正不少小伙伴表示，很兴奋。\n\n这东西背后的技术是啥？当然还是咱们的老熟人 ------GPT-3.\n其实 GPT-3 这模型的特点，说穿了就是大。因为模型庞大，参数众多，所以从海量语料库里积攒的「认知」就多。注意我这里刻意回避了「知识」这个词儿。\n\n（资料来源：t.ly/cY1kn）\n从上图中，你不难看到，现在的文本和代码生成中，GPT-3 都占据了重要位置。\n我喜欢共享内容的原因之一，是视频发出后总可以获得观众进一步的反馈。不少的问题，都会激发我的思考。\n例如有小伙伴在视频后面提问，说这个东西能不能帮着理解中文论文啊？\n\n这是个很好的问题。毕竟很多国内人文社科研究生平时阅读的论文，更大比例是中文的。\n我一开始觉得这个问题问得有些太贪心了。对于一个外国人做的刚上线应用，你指望人家立即支持阅读中文，还能看懂中文的研究论文，不大现实吧？\n刚要回复，我突然想起来 上次在 Lex 上面的教训了。既然 explainpaper 的底层模型是 GPT-3 ，那它本来就该认得中文啊。\n为了确保回答准确，还是实际测试一下吧。我传了一篇自己的论文上去。\n\n中文划线高亮之后，AI 反馈的结果让我有些吃惊。\n尽管 explainpaper 并不能直接用中文来解释信息。但它可以立即识别出「知识管理」就是 knowledge management ，然后进一步解释下去。\n下面这段解释，就更有意思了。\n\n它先广泛解释「插件」是啥，然后结合本文的上下文，指出 Roam Toolkit 是一种插件，并且描述了它的功能。\n不仅如此，从下图可以看出，就连划线的时候字符之间出现了空格间隔，也依然能正常识别和解释。\n\n下面，我故意找了个文中没有进行详细解释的「概念网络」，结果是这样的。\n\n我能确定，这解释里面出现的「宠物」、「猫」、「狗」啥的，肯定没在本文正文出现过。\nEvernote 这一段，让我愣住了。\n\nExplainpaper 居然是准确识别了这张表格，并且把内容总结梳理，然后用英文输出了出来。\n上述的演示，是不是回答了读者的问题呢？我觉得算不上。从需求分析来看，人家看中文论文遇到术语不清楚，自然是需要中文的解释。你再弄成英文给我，这......\n可换个角度想想，这东西帮助外国人阅读中文论文，可是再好不过了。遇到中文专业词汇，随时可以获得准确的英文解释，而且阐述还贴合论文的上下文。外国人读中文论文，将减少很多障碍。这或许可以快速提升中文论文的影响力，妙啊！\n另外，目前 explainpaper 缺乏中文解释能力，也给国内的开发者提供了发展空间。希望早日看到更多 AI 实际应用上线，帮助国人理解中文论文。\n我期待你能自己尝试一下这款在线应用。至少在目前，它是免费的。而且因为上传的都是公开发表的论文，也不存在用户隐私泄漏问题。所以可以放心大胆地尝试 ------ 特别是对于最近要写文献综述的小伙伴来说。\n欢迎你把自己测试的结果和经验心得，分享在留言区。咱们一起交流讨论。\n祝论文阅读愉快！\n如果你觉得本文有用，请充电。\n如果本文可能对你的朋友有帮助，请转发给他们。\n欢迎关注我的专栏「科研利器」，以便及时收到后续的更新内容。\n \n \n延伸阅读\n如何高效入门 Logseq ？\n互联网上的时光机器\n如何高效学 Python？\nVOSviewer 中文视频教程\n【知识星球精选】刻意练习区的辅助线",

Since then, speculation about the timing and scope of the expected layoffs has run rampant inside Twitter. \nEmployees will receive an email by 9AM PST on November 4th confirming whether they have been laid off or not, according to the internal memo, which also states that employee badge access to Twitter’s offices will be shut off “temporarily.”\n\n\n“We acknowledge this is an incredibly challenging experience to go through, whether...\nContinue reading…",

The company is adding support for Apple’s Tap to Pay technology into the PayPal and Venmo iOS apps, meaning merchants will be able to accept contactless credit or debit cards and mobile wallets without an external card reader (via MacRumors). \nApple first announced Tap to Pay in February. Integration with PayPal and Venmo’s apps might mark a notable step up for adoption of Apple’s touchless technology and could be helpful for merchants who don’t want to rely on external readers to accept contactless payments. It will also help PayPal compete with payments rival Square, which launched support for Tap to Pay in September. \nSupport will be...\nContinue reading…",

It’s sometimes a slightly different story for the MacBook Pros with the beefier M1 Pro and M1 Max CPUs, but any savings you can get on those Pro models is sure to be worthwhile.

You can even set up automations when you hit milestones—like Slacking your team when web traffic hits 1M views. Here’s a glimpse of what you can do:\n\n✅ Use cases: \n* Build and share custom reports for your team and stakeholders. \n* Invite your team to analyze your website’s performance together.\n* Make data-based decisions, plan your marketing campaigns, and build custom automations for your data. \n\nSpecial thanks to the @coda_hq team for their support 🙌\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "So here is the pitch to your company why it makes so much sense:\n🔒 Security –  If you lose your badge or someone steals it, they can use it to access your office. With mobile access, the access will turn off automatically if the phone is locked or once the authentication token expires. Connect the mobile app with Okta, G Suite or Azure ID for even strong security\n⏱ Ease of onboarding/offboarding – No need to wait for a picture to be taken, badge to be printed and to be physically picked up. Think of all the remote hires who have been with the company for months or maybe years but happen to be visiting the HQ city, to visit the office. Large organizations can connect M-Tag with their HR system like Workday, or ticketing systems like ServiceNow to automate even the provisioning of physical access, automatically\n🏠 Aligned with the hybrid office trend -  Employees who do not come to office everyday are 58% more likely to lose or forget their badges at home. Moreover, with limited or no round-the-clock front-desk admins, it is really hard to let in such employees, new hires or traveling employees. The M-Tag, has got you covered here\n📈 Ease of collecting analytics for understanding real-estate utilization –  With the M-Tag’s cloud reporting and dashboard, you may chart out physical traffic into the office by day of the week or time of the day. Even better, you get to create automated alerts in Slack to let your colleagues know when you enter the office. The possibilities are endless\n\n🌟 What’s more - for a limited time, we are offering a 60-day free trial on the Oloid M-Tag for our early adopters who sign up through Product Hunt. Also, we are offering the M-Tag hardware completely free of cost for those who upgrade their subscription.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "@rrhoover !\n\nAfter starting a new job with the CIA shortly after, I took a break from Founder's Choice to focus on my career.\n\nI left the Agency after 2.5 years due to my father's passing and I immediately wanted to get back to Founder's Choice and bring it back stronger than ever!\n\nThe purpose of Founder's Choice is to be a one-stop-shop for people to discover new startups and learn how to build their own. After receiving some feedback, we confirmed that this combination of content (startup discovery + startup development) is a bit more refreshing than the constant venture capital news with startup profiles spliced in between.\n\nOne big change since our last launch is a heavier focus on building a community around the platform. I'll be launching a podcast in the near future where I'll talk startups and invite some other founders on to discuss how they gained traction.\n\nThanks (again) for the support and I hope to meet you all in the community some day! 🙂\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "@patrick_pijnappel and I built Luminal because we were frustrated with existing Python notebooks. \n\nPython is a very powerful programming language, but it can be hard/confusing to use! There are a few aspects to this:\n\n- Python likes functions with _lots_ of arguments. Without good type info this means constantly switching back and forth between the docs and your editor.\n- Except for basic syntax errors, you generally don't know that you have an error in your code until you run it. This can be very annoying, especially if running takes a while!\n- Many things that are commonly done in Python are well... common. Reading data, plotting, writing data, filtering, etc. However, they can still take quite a while to figure out in practice. That shouldn't be the case!\n\nThat's where Luminal comes in.\n\nLuminal was built with static typing at its core from day one, so when you write code you have best-in-class auto-complete right there, including all the relevant type information and docs (even for specific parameters!).\n\nWith Luminal, you can find issues in your code earlier (before you run your code), or use no-code cells for repetitive or tedious tasks.\n\nYou can collaborate on a script with others in real-time or share it via link for someone else to use.\n\n... And this is just the tip of the iceberg! There's so much we want to do with Luminal to take the friction out of writing Python, but a product has to start somewhere and this is it! We hope you're as excited as we are about making Python easier to use and we're looking forward to your thoughts and feedback!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

We learned that the biggest barrier to roll out the next killer application is learning how to merge blockchain with mobile development, both on the engineering side, as well as on the policy side (Guidance on how to get listed on Google Play and App Store). \n\nThat's why we launched Smart SDK, a platform that make it insanely easy to deploy, grow and monetize your mobile dApps (or cross-platform). We provide open source and free solutions to authentication, MPC wallet, and marketplaces. You can also use our advance services to configure and deploy your white-labeled marketplace to generate revenue directly in-app. \n\nWith Mirror World's Smart SDK, you can authenticate with social logins, provide users with a MPC non-custodial wallet, and configure a cross-platform marketplace within a day. We support SDKs in Android, Unity, Javascript, Rust and more (iOS coming next month). We will also offer user acquisition support with our 120,000 people community:)\n\nSince launch our beta a month ago, there have been 200 + projects building on top of our Smart SDK. Few lines of mobile code, all of Crypto's potential. \n\nOur platform is in beta but open to everyone with 0 upfront cost.
