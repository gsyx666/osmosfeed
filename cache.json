          "description": "随着技术的进步，企业，无论大小，都必须将自己转变为数字公司。转型不再是“选择”的问题；相反，它是关于“如何”推进过渡。这就是 AIOps 的用武之地。\n\r\n\r\n将组织转变为数字公司会遇到很多挑战。缺乏专门的 IT 技能、组织变革管理、不断变化的客户需求和混合环境只是其中的一小部分。企业需要增强其 IT 运营（ITOps）以应对这些挑战并满足客户期望。\n\r\n数字化转型：AIOps 之路\n\r\n未来，ITOps 将结合算法和人工智能，使 IT 系统的性能变得透明，并帮助他们提供无缝体验。\n\r\n\r\n“AIOps 对 IT 运营的长期影响将是变革性的。” —— Gartner\n\r\n\r\nAIOps 对于成功的数字化转型至关重要，可以帮助系统以现代业务所需的速度运行。反过来，这将确定公司获得和保持市场领先地位的速度。\n\r\n现代 AIOps 技术在本地、云端或混合环境中提供 IT 基础架构。它们的自动化使开发人员能够专注于设计下一代业务应用，而不必担心底层基础设施。\n\r\n什么是 AIOps？\n\r\nAIOps 结合人工智能和机器学习来分析 IT 运营的数据。这是将人工智能应用于 IT 运营的过程。它可以帮助组织主动检测错误，还可以帮助运营团队在问题影响最终用户之前预防问题。\n\r\n传统的 IT 管理技术已经无法应对数字化业务转型。当 Gartner 创造 AIOps 一词时，该公司预测 IT 运营过程将发生重大变化，组织管理其 IT 生态系统的方式也会发生巨大变化。\n\r\nAIOps 平台使用大数据。他们从各种 IT 运营和设备收集数据，以自动识别和实时响应问题，同时仍提供传统的历史分析。然后，AIOps 使用机器学习对组合的 IT 数据执行综合分析。\n\r\n结果是自动化驱动的洞察力驱使持续改进和修复。AIOps 支持基本 IT 功能的持续集成和部署 （CI/CD）。\n\r\nAIOps 的范围是什么？\n\r\n开始使用 AIOps 最初似乎具有挑战性，因此最好采取循序渐进的方法。我们需要从识别和理解 IT 运营数据开始。 AIOps 的核心是数据驱动。因此，它需要访问所有相关的操作数据，包括非结构化数据、日志、指标、实时数据、API 输出和设备数据。还需要结构化的业务数据，例如数据库、社交活动和其他关系数据。 AIOps 平台处理的相关数据越多，他们的预测就越准确。\n\r\n企业需要了解他们的数据如何帮助他们解决最大的问题，无论他们身处哪个行业。他们应该实施 AIOps 来回顾他们过去的失败，并确定哪些数据将帮助他们找到解决方案。\n\r\n数据分析可用于查找中断或系统变慢的根源。然后 AIOps 平台可用于检测常见问题及其补救措施。企业可以使用收集到的结果来实施机器学习和 AI，以进行实时监控和自动响应。这整个过程帮助公司推动 AI 成熟，有效地修复错误，避免停机，提高效率。\n\r\n\n\r\n为什么 2022 年需要 AIOps？\n\r\n随着企业加快数字化转型，应用程序和系统架构变得非常先进。我们可以通过以下几种方式见证这种复杂性：\n\r\n\r\n组织正在从传统的应用架构转移到云原生、灵活和基于微服务的容器化应用堆栈。\n\r\n这些应用也部署在本地、混合、公共和私有云平台上。\n\r\n\r\n随着应用和 IT 环境的扩展，它们会产生大量数据。 IT 运营团队因无法管理的数据而筋疲力尽。但是，人工智能可以处理大量数据。随着数据量的扩大，将人工智能纳入 IT 流程的机会要大得多。\n\r\n异常检测、分类和预测都可以通过使用机器学习和深度学习模型来完成，这些模型擅长分析海量数据并提供分析。AIOps 的许多功能可帮助公司通过交互式仪表盘提供良好的用户体验。\n\r\n实施 AIOps 的企业报告了诸如无缝体验、更低的运营费用、更快的客户服务、更短的平均解决时间和更少的停机时间等好处。 AIOps 通过基于预测分析做出坚定的决策来支持 IT 运营。\n\r\n最后一点\n\r\nAIOps 是 IT 运营分析（ITOA）的下一步。 人工智能、认知技能和 RPA（机器人流程自动化）用于在基础设施或 IT 运营问题成为问题之前自动修复它们。 自我修复系统是 AIOps 的最终目标。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/09/get-ready-to-embrace-the-aiops-era/\n\r\n作者：Amit Shingala 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "在这个大众觉醒的时代，我们常常听到「我们需要探索自我，了解自己」。但是，假设我们很粗暴地把人分为三种：认为不需要寻找自我的人（或不知道「寻找自我」重要性的人）、正在寻找自我的人、以及找到了自我的人，第一类人是绝大多数，第二类是少数，第三类是少数中的少数。\n这其实也对应了我们认识自我的三个阶段。\n第一阶段是我们需要觉醒，意识到探索自我的重要性。\n为什么探索自我对每个人都很重要？\n人是需要意义驱动的动物，我们天生有实现自身价值的冲动。但每个人的价值、优势是不同的。我的性格是怎样的？我想做的事情是什么？对我来说，什么最重要？我未来的方向是什么？我想过上怎么样的生活？我的价值实现在哪？这些问题如果得不到解答，短短一生很容易忙忙碌碌、随着大流就这样过去了，实在可惜。\n项飙在《把自己作为方法》中说：\n\n（瓶颈的问题）是回到自己作为一个边缘者、回到我是谁的问题。想清楚究竟我能做什么，我跟世界的关系是什么。我认为世界上所有的人都有这个问题，都得搞清楚自己是谁，否则都会有这种危机，除非完全盲目地被主流裹挟进去。\n\n当我们意识到探索自我的需求之后，我们还需要方法，这就来到了第二阶段——开始寻找自我。但我感觉，很多人对于探索自我的方法却没有什么头绪。\n困难之处，在于「自我」是非常复杂的，我们之所以是今天这样，受到了童年经历、社交媒体、朋友亲人、国家文化等等各种因素的影响，这些影响之中大部分更是在日常不知不觉之中就成为了我们的一部分，所以无论是从横向（各种因素的复杂性）和纵向（性格和价值观形成过程的复杂性）看，自我都是极其复杂的。\n但好在，这几年通过各种各样的渠道和自证，我积累了一些有用的、可执行的方法，想在这里分享给你。\n再多读几本书\n阅读有什么用呢？学习知识肯定是好处之一，可是看完可能就忘了；拓展眼界也是的，可是没去亲身经历还是差了一点。\n那最大的用处是什么呢？我认为， 是读自己。\n在《活下去…",

          "description": "起初，我从未感受到我妈对于衰老的恐惧。直到大概五六年前我家重新装修房子的时候，我妈坚持要在他们卧室的厕所里装一个马桶，后来问了原因才知道，她大概是觉得以后自己老了，万一腿脚不方便了，用马桶会轻松很多。从那一刻起，我才猛然发觉这种隐秘的恐惧。\n第七次全国人口普查的的数据显示，目前中国60岁及以上的人口数量已超2.6亿，这个人数占总人数的18.7%。这就意味着，有相当一部分老人正在经历着这种关于衰老的隐秘恐惧，还会有越来越多的人陷入这种关于衰老的恐惧。\n为了回应这些恐惧，很多人可能最先想到的是“适老化改造”。当然，适老化改造是一个相当大的问题域，本文目前所要探讨的仅仅是房屋的适老化改造，特别是对现有的城镇房屋进行一些“修补性”的适老化改造。\n为什么要进行房屋适老化改造？\n我们需要先回答一个问题：为什么我们要率先对“房屋”这样一个区域进行适老化改造呢？这个问题的答案有很多。\n首先是出于目前国内养老格局的考虑。国内养老事业呈现出一种所谓的“9073”的格局。也就是说，90%左右的老年人居家养老，大约7%的老年人需要依托社区进行养老，最后3%左右的老年人将入住养老院。这意味着大多数老人会在自己的家中度过大部分的晚年时光。这几乎是最适合老人，同时也是最经济的养老方式。\n其次是出于老人活动范围的考虑。随着年龄的增长，老人的社会活动范围会逐渐缩小，老人对于居住空间的依赖程度也会越来越高。这意味着，居住环境成为老人晚年生活最重要的空间载体，居住条件的好坏将会直接影响老人的生活质量。[1]\n再次是出于老年人人体工学的考虑。据老年人人体工学的研究，在衰老过程中人体的尺寸也会发生变化。医学研究资料显示：人在28-30岁时身高最高，35-40岁之后逐渐出现衰减，70岁时身高会比年轻时减少2.5%-3%。[2]这就意味着，随着居住者年龄的增长，房屋也应该发生一些改变。\n所以，出于上述的种种原因，除了大…",

          "description": "前些日子，我给你介绍了本地使用 Stable Diffusion 人工智能绘画工具的方法（如何在你的 M1/M2 Mac 本地运行 Stable Diffusion？）。不少小伙伴们反馈说玩儿得很开心。\n\n不过也有不开心的，因为手头儿没有 M1/M2 的 Mac 电脑。\n\n是不是因为设备限制，就只能眼巴巴看着别人体验新科技成果呢？\n当然不是。人工智能技术的普及化，已经是科技发展的潮流趋势了。我今天给你介绍一个不需要安装任何应用的体验方式。而且，更好的消息是，你都不用把自己的想法翻译成英文了，直接输入中文就行。\n这是个微信小程序，叫做「盗梦师」。开发者是西湖大学蓝振忠老师团队。\n我这里给你做个演示。\n今早我看到有人分享了一段视频，是喷气式背包的实验场景。很有意思。\n\n于是我就在朋友圈发了一番感慨：\n\n有了这玩意儿，上班堵车不是事儿了。\n\n感慨之后，觉得光用文字表达不够形象，刚好就可以用「盗梦师」画出来。\n于是我打开小程序，输入了这样一段话：\n\n一个背着喷气式背包的中年人在交通拥堵的马路上轻松自在飞行\n\n这里注意你可以选择绘画的类型。我选择的是「赛博朋克」，我觉得和主题很搭。\n\n然后是选择画家风格。我对赛博朋克艺术家不了解，于是设置成为「不限定」。\n\n下面还有一个选项，是画面的长宽比例。我觉得对于展示的画作来说， 16:9 感觉上比较好。\n好了，做了这些设定后，就可以直接画了。\n\n这里需要等上几秒钟即可，比本地 M1 Mac 运行起 Stable Diffusion 来快多了。画做好了，你感觉怎么样呢？\n\n有了这样的形象画面，朋友圈里的评论一下子就丰富了起来，例如：\n\n假发套得粘的紧一点\n\n以及：\n\n当姑娘们画好了妆，做好了头发，美美的在街上走着，然后突然被人用喷气背包的风吹乱的时候，你猜她们会不会捡石头把它打下来\n\n我觉得，这些担心，都不无道理，值得背包开发商们认真记录和讨论。\n如果你感兴趣的话，直接打开微信，搜索这个小程序试试看吧。上文图中也包含了二维码可以直达。目前阶段，每天有 5 次免费创作机会。然后每分享给一位好友，双方可以获得 20 次创作额度。\n当然，我也尝试了一些其他的图画，例如中国风的「雪中山寺古钟」。\n\n雪、山都齐全了，只是寺庙在哪里？找了半天没看到，哈哈。如果你玩儿过 Stable Diffusion ，应该知道很多时候你需要多画几张，从中选择更合适的图画。所以我准备等明天有了新的额度，再用同样的文本，多画几张对比看看。\n欢迎把你的尝试结果和经验心得分享到留言区，咱们一起交流讨论。\n祝人工智能绘画愉快！\n如果你觉得本文有用，请充电。\n如果本文可能对你的朋友有帮助，请转发给他们。\n欢迎关注我的专栏「科研利器」，以便及时收到后续的更新内容。\n  \n \n延伸阅读\n\n【知识星球精选】刻意练习区的辅助线\n“没有灵魂” 的 AI 文本生成，有啥用？\n可视化卡片笔记写作？我试了最近才开放的 Heptabase\n大块的写作时间？这个时代，它是奢侈品\n互联网上的时光机器",

          "description": "小众消息的冯大辉前两天推送了一篇很有意思的文章，大概是探讨一个B站视频对微信存储机制可能存在的误解。文中提出了一个实验方法，看到做了试验可能会有奖品，我眼睛一下放光，不如就趁此机会做几个试验，好好探讨一下微信在iOS上的文件存储机制，包括：\n\n转发文件是否会占用额外的存储空间？\n从同一人处多次接收同一份文件是否会占用额外的空间？\n从不同人处多次接收同一份文件是否会占用额外的空间？\n微信和WeChat在以上这些问题上是否存在差异？\n同一台手机上的不同微信账号接收的同一文件是否占用额外存储空间？\n\n试验的环境是iOS 14.8.1、iPhone 11、微信8.0.28。首先我们删除手机上的微信重新安装。登录一个WeChat小号（小号A）。此时微信占用的空间是少的可怜的752.2MB，其中数据占244.5MB。我提前准备好了一个Ubuntu的iso镜像（880MB）。将它发送给这个小号。下载后重启手机，可以看到，微信占用的空间变成了1.77GB，其中数据占1.26GB。多出来大约1GB的空间，可能是除了文件以外的缓存、其他需要的程序和资源文件。\n接收文件前后的微信\n接下来我们正式开始实验。我们讲接收到的文件转发给三个不同的小号。重启手机，可以看到，如冯大辉所料，微信所占用的存储空间并没有增加。依然是1.77GB（数据1.26GB)。微信显然做了最基本的文件存储去重。\n所占空间没有变化\n接下来，我从另一个微信号将刚刚发送的文件再次转发给小号三遍。当我点进新发送的文件时，看到需要接受文件，我有一种不详的预感。难道微信真会重新接收一遍文件？所幸，当我点击接收文件后，文件在一瞬间就接收完成了。显然，微信也伴有服务器端的去重，在服务器上的同一份文件，在本地并不会接收多次。重启手机也可以看到，微信占用的空间并无增加。\n看似要重新接收，实际所占空间没有明显变化\n按照这个逻辑，即使是不同的人转发给我的同一份文件，应该也不会需要重复下载，或是占用额外的空间。我试着用另外两个小号（小号B、小号C）将同一份文件转发给小号A。虽然也显示需要接收文件，但同刚才一样，一瞬间就完成了接收。再次重启手机，微信所占用的空间依旧没有变化。\n不过，刚才验证的情况中，虽然是多个账号转发给一个小号，但是微信很容易在服务器端追溯到，这些文件的源头是同一个。那假如各个账号是各自上传的同一份文件，微信在服务器端是否也有去重能力呢？为此，我在另一台小米手机上登录小号B与小号C，各自发送同一份文件给小号Ａ。发送文件的时间较长。这似乎足以让人判断出，微信大概没有类似百度网盘的文件去重判断。\n然而出人意料的是，小号A还是一瞬间就完成了文件的接收。重启手机后也可以看到，微信所占用的空间并没有明显增加（总计1.83GB，数据1.32GB）。这说明至少在服务器端，微信确实能够判断出一份文件是否曾经上传过。而缺少类似网盘的秒传功能，可能是微信本身没有相关功能，也可能是Android端微信需要优化。\n实际所占空间依然只有一份文件大小\n出于好奇，我又尝试从小号B发送一份内容相同，只有文件名不同的文件，看看微信的查重是否基于文件名，或是基于文件本身。经过等待漫长的发送，如我所料，接收只在一瞬间就完成了。由此可知，微信的文件去重基于内容，并不依赖名字。\n不同文件名也不会多占用空间\n上面测试的都是同一账号下的情况。那么，同一台手机上的不同账号间又是怎样呢？我尝试在刚刚登录小号A的手机上切换了一个微信账号B。可以看到，这次转发收到的相同文件，需要重新接收下载。重启手机也能看到微信的占用空间变为3.8G（数据3.29G）。不过在这一微信账号下，同一文件仍然只需要下载保存一份，再次收到就能秒存。同时利用这个微信账号简单试了一下，我发现以上WeChat的文件存储机制对微信也同样成立。\n实打实地需要下载，所占空间也倍增了\n到这里，我们可以基本得出结论，iOS的微信文件存储去重做得还是比较令人满意的。同一账号下的同一个文件，只要内容相同，就只会在本地留存一份。未来微信团队可以努力的方向是不同账号间的文件存储去重。\n另外值得一提的是，微信大概是真的有在代码层面实现去重，而非依赖APFS的CoW特性。因为即使只占一份空间，iPhone在统计容量时也会重复计算一个文件的多次拷贝。通过多次复制粘贴同一份文件，你能很容易地复现苹果的这个Bug：\n苹果什么时候出4T iPhone？\n在我原本的设想中，我写出这篇文章后，与其拿到那500元钱，我更想获得一个与Fenng交流的机会，说服他微信是一个糟糕的产品。但转念一下，即使我做到了，也并不能改变得了微信这个产品本身，以及我们必须使用它的环境。更何况再一看那篇文章，是要证明微信没有去重才能拿到那笔钱。是我审题不细了😀\n\n如果你觉得我的这篇文章不错，也欢迎你阅读我之前有关微信的两篇文章：虎头蛇尾的《微信戒断实验》与尝试减少微信占用空间的《微微微信怎么办》。",

A spreadsheet is essentially a database, but the constraints of a graphical application render most spreadsheet applications useless to programmers. With Edge and IoT devices becoming significant target platforms, developers need powerful but lightweight solutions for storing, processing, and querying large amounts of data.

Unfortunately, that’s not going to be the case, and there’s going to be a bit of a wait, but not an especially long one.\nWhile there was no new footage from The Witcher’s third season shown at this year’s Tudum presentation, Cavill and co-stars Anya Chalotra, and Freya Allan a made brief appearances to share some teaser art and to announce that the series will return in 2023. \nTaken at face value, there isn’t all that much to glean from the teaser art, which features the wolf,...\nContinue reading…",

But that all changed when del Toro stopped by Netflix’s annual Tudum event to give everyone a closer look into the labor-intensive, mesmerizing, and magical process that brought his Pinocchio to life.\nIn the new video, which features a number of different Pinocchio scenes in the midst of production, del Toro opens up a bit about what all he wanted to bring to his take on the fairytale, and why he insisted that the bulk of its animation was done by hand. \nWhile there’s also quite a bit of digital...\nContinue reading…",

Will machines take over?\n\nAt the intersection of technology, art, and controversy - me and my co-founder Eric are launching Dreamsands, a platform to explore and buy licensing for AI generated visuals, images and content. As of today, we're inviting all creators and enthusiasts to submit their work on Dreamsands. Over 1 million visuals have already been submitted during our beta from the most cutting edge artists in AI creation.\n\nIt is estimated that more than 15.000 million AI images are created every day, with varying quality and purpose - and so far there hasn’t been any attempts to aggregate, curate and present this new image revolution online. As avid art lovers we found it increasingly hard to keep track of all the new imaging tools, forums and subreddits where people were posting amazing work, and thus the idea for Dreamsands was born.  \n\nWith Dreamsands we let anyone, anywhere in the world enjoy and explore the beauty and weirdness of AI generated visuals. \n\nHere’s a highlight of some of Dreamsands’ initial features:\n\n◦      Explore over 1M+ images \n◦      Follow your favourite artists\n◦      Like / Save / Favorite posts\n◦\tSave, and buy the art you like\n◦      Buy royalty-free licenses\n◦\tSuggested posts\n\nProduct Hunt Deal 💸\n\n- We’re releasing 1000 limited invites today for Product Hunt users only. Apply for exclusive access today and we’ll guarantee an invite within 1 week!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
