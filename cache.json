According to the UTF-8 encoding standard, ASCII characters are single-byte. However, other characters range between 1 and 4 bytes, because of this inconsistency, it is nearly impossible to index a specific character inside a string.\nIf we want to index a character in Golang, we can convert a string to an array or rune.

Useful to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your software’s performance and behavior.\nOpenTelemetry integrates with popular libraries and frameworks such as Spring, Express, Quarkus, and with a lot of languages, including Go :-).\n\nIf you have ever heard of OpenTracing or are used to using it, know that now OpenTracing is deprecated, so it is better to use OpenTelemetry 🙂.\nmigrate from OpenTracing to OpenT…",

Long polling also holds the request for a period if it has no response to send it back.\nHTTP long polling is a traditional polling variant that allows the server to push information to a client whenever the data is available. However, after the client requests data from the server, unlike normal polling, it may not receive the response immediately. HTTP long polling is also known as the “Hanging GET” technique since the client can be left hanging for a long time.\nWe are familiar with the standard HTTP web request where a client opens a connection and makes a data request which is processed by the server for a response to send back to the client. However, in HTTP Long polli…",

          "description": "在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 中安装最新的 LibreOffice 版本的快速指南。\n\r\n\r\n自由开源的办公套件 LibreOffice 有两个版本：社区版和企业版。“社区” 版是为那些希望获得最新的尖端软件技术的早期采用者准备的。而 “企业” 版本更加稳定，可能不包括所有的最新功能，但它是生产环境和专业工作的理想选择。\n\r\n在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 中安装最新的 LibreOffice\n\r\n1、删除预安装的 LibreOffice\n\r\nUbuntu 和其他的 Linux 发行版带有预安装的 LibreOffice。这可能不是最新的，这是因为发行版有特定的发行周期。在进行新安装之前，你可以通过以下命令删除 Ubuntu 及其衍生发行版中的的旧版本。\n\r\n打开一个终端并运行以下命令，以删除 Ubuntu 和相关发行版中的已安装的 LibreOffice。对于其他发行版，你可以使用发行版的软件包管理器将其删除。\n\r\nsudo apt remove –purge libreoffice*\r\nsudo apt autoclean\r\nsudo apt autoremove\r\n\n\r\n然后重启以确保一切正常（尽管你也可以跳过这一步）。\n\r\n2、从网站上下载安装\n\r\n前往 官方下载页面. 并通过从下拉菜单中选择类型下载 “最新的” 版本。对于 Ubuntu 和其他衍生产品，请选择 .deb 文件。\n\r\n\n\r\n下载后，提取文件；你应该看到下面的所有软件包。\n\r\n\n\r\n在提取文件的位置打开终端，并按顺序运行以下命令。首先，你需要安装 ure 包，其次是核心包，然后是所有的基本包。最后，就是主要的 LibreOffice 软件包。下面是一组典型的命令。你需要更改为具体版本的版本号。\n\r\nsudo dpkg -i libobasis7.0-ure_7.0.4.2-2_amd64.deb\r\nsudo dpkg -i libobasis7.0-core_7.0.4.2-2_amd64.deb\r\nsudo dpkg -i libobasis7.0*\r\n\n\r\nsudo dpkg -i libreoffice7.0*\r\n\n\r\n如果你使用的是 Fedora Linux 或 Red Hat Linux，请按照上述相同的顺序使用 dnf 命令。\n\r\n\n\r\n等待安装完成。完成后，你可以通过应用程序菜单找到 LibreOffice。\n\r\n\n\r\n这应该完成安装最新 LibreOffice 的步骤。如果你不想遵循上述方法，请参阅以下选项。\n\r\n通过 PPA 安装\n\r\n如果你想通过 PPA 安装它，请按照以下步骤操作。确保在上面的第 1 步中删除现有的 LibreOffice。\n\r\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa\r\n\n\r\n最后，运行以下命令从这个官方 PPA 安装最新的 LibreOffice 5.4 系列。\n\r\nsudo apt update\r\nsudo apt install libreoffice\r\n\n\r\n安装后，你可以通过 Dash 搜索启动 LibreOffice。\n\r\n\n\r\n通过 Snap 和 Flatpak 安装\n\r\n如果你是 Linux 用户，你可以尝试 LibreOffice 独立的可执行文件，它在 Snap 或 Flatpak 等沙箱中运行。\n\r\n要通过 Flatpak 安装 LibreOffice ，请访问 这个页面 进行设置，然后运行以下命令进行安装：\n\r\nflatpak install flathub org.libreoffice.LibreOffice\r\n\n\r\n同样，对于 Snap 版本，使用以下命令进行安装：\n\r\nsudo snap install libreoffice\r\n\n\r\n如何升级到最新的 LibreOffice 版本？\n\r\n如果你不想删除 LibreOffice 但想升级到最新版本，请阅读我们下面的完整指南。\n\r\n\r\n在 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 和 Windows 中升级到最新的 LibreOffice\n\r\n\r\n如果你在安装最新的 LibreOffice 时遇到问题，请随时留言。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/install-latest-libreoffice-ubuntu-linux/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：littlebirdnest 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "虽然现在多屏用户逐渐变多，但仍是小众，Windows 也并没过对多屏使用进行太多的优化。所以只好自己动手，于是有了以下一些个人自用的优化设置。\n窗口出现位置优化\nWindows 系统仅对多屏用户提供了简单主显示器的设置，默认情况下所有新打开的窗口都只会出现在主显示器上，即使你在使用另一个的显示器。而「基于显示器连接记住窗口位置」只能记住上次关闭时所在的屏幕，实用性并不高。\n\n这时微软自家的 Power Toys 里的 FancyZones 就可以派上用场了，除了我们熟知的窗口布局设置外，它还可以调整窗口行为，在这里我们可以通过启用「将新创建的窗口移动到当前 活动的监视器（实验性）」来达到这一效果，美中不足的是动画不够优雅。\n\n窗口出现的问题解决了，但任务栏上默认是显示所有屏幕上的窗口，不能让我们快速区分哪些应用是在当前屏幕下的。\n\n为了解决该问题，如下图所示，Windows 提供了简陋的选项加让人摸不着头脑的翻译。设置后，每个屏幕下的任务栏就只显示当前屏幕下打开的窗口，更符合直觉，不过 Win + 数字 的快捷键就只能在主显示器上使用了。\n\n内容显示优化\n现在 Windows 下大部分的应用都适配高 DPI 的，少部分不支持的，也可以通过 Windows 自带的属性 - 兼容性选项来调整。\n\n上面的设置仅解决了单个应用在高分辨率屏幕下的问题，并不能解决应用在分辨率相差太大的显示器间移动时会出现界面变形问题。这时，如果你使用的 AMD 显卡，那你可以通过启用 AMD Radeon Software 里的「超虚拟分辨率」来让低分辨率屏切换到更高的逻辑分辨率，不仅缩小的多屏间的分辨率差距，还有抗锯齿的效果。由于个人没有使用 Nvidia 和 Intel 显卡，相关选项是否存在请自行到显卡设置里翻找。\n\n设置完成后到 Windows 设置调整下逻辑分辨率和缩放即可。\n\n除此之外，对于我们网上冲浪必备的浏览器，它的缩放是固定的，且只有一个设置选项。不知道有没有人跟我一样两个屏幕的缩放比例是不一样的，在两个屏幕间移动浏览器时，网页内容并不会根据 DPI 而变化，导致观感割裂。在这里我推荐一个 FireFox 浏览器插件：ffreszoom，它可以实时感知屏幕宽度的变化，当宽度超过指定值时，自动调整到指定缩放比例。设置前先通过这个网站查看自己的屏幕宽度：http://whatismyscreenresolution.net/，需要将 Firefox 浏览器移动到不同显示器上刷新。\n\n如图所示我的外屏宽度是 1728 px，笔记本内屏为 1024，所以我在两者之间随意取了一个值用于判断，若当前屏幕宽度超过 1600 px，就自动设置缩放为 1.5，也即 150%。若小于 1600 px，则使用浏览器设置里的值。两种缩放无缝切换，只会多了一个缩放的动画。由于本人没使用 Chromium 类浏览器，并没有对应的插件推荐，不过其用户这么多，应该会有类似的插件。\n\n利用「闲置的」触摸板\n不知有没有跟我一样喜欢使用笔记本键盘的，且平时一些简单的操作直接用触摸板直接操作。现在 Windows 11 已经支持自定义触摸板多指手势了，但其不能根据不同应用设置不同的手势，例如：A 软件可以用 Ctrl  + W 关闭，但 B 软件只能用 Alt + F4，同一个操作有不同的快捷键。\n\n这时就需要第三方软件了，这里我推荐 GestureSign，界面虽然是 Windows 10 风格，但不影响使用，毕竟设置完就不用再看了。它可以为不同应用的不同快捷键键设置相同的触控手势，手势类型也不再仅限于横平竖直，可以自由发挥。同时软件也内置了一些常用的命令供选择。\n\n上图是我的一些设置，双指一般使用系统默认就不添加上去了。其中个人最爱的是三指滑动切换标签，体验比鼠标点击更加符合人的直觉。对于频繁使用搜索启动器的我，把三指上滑指定为搜索启动器的快捷键，方便呼出。\n \n对了，设置前记得把系统自带的相关手势取消掉，不然会冲突。若你仍不习惯使用触摸板，该软件也支持鼠标手势，具体可以自行下载体验。\n结尾\n以上便是我在使用多屏时遇到的问题，及相关解决方法，希望对多屏用户有帮助。",

Chances are, whoever committed the bug didn't declare it in their Git commit message. In some cases, it might have been present for weeks, months, or even years, meaning you would need to search through hundreds or thousands of commits to find when the problem was introduced. This is the problem that git bisect was built to solve!\nThe git bisect command is a powerful tool that quickly checks out a commit halfway between a known good state and a known bad state and then asks you to identify the commit as either good or bad.

A longer answer touches on where C stands among programming languages in general and towards Rust in particular. C, C++, and Rust are systems languages, which give programmers access to machine-level data types and operations. Among these three systems languages, C remains the dominant one. The kernels of modern operating systems are written mainly in C, with assembly language accounting for the rest.

Hotz said his priority at the social media company is to fix its search feature, as well as to remove the prompt that prevents you from browsing the service on the web without logging in.\nThe internship came about after Hotz expressed support for Musk’s “extremely hardcore” ultimatum to Twitter’s employees, which demanded that they work “long hours at high intensity” or else depart the company. Hotz said that “this is the attitude that builds incredible things” and that he’d be willing to do an internship at the company....\nContinue reading…",
