Solana implements an innovative hybrid consensus model that combines a unique 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐟-𝐨𝐟-𝐡𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 (𝐏𝐨𝐇)  algorithm with the lightning-fast synchronization engine, which is a version of 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐟-𝐨𝐟-𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞 (𝐏𝐨𝐒) . Because of this, the Solana network can theoretically process over 𝟕𝟏𝟎,𝟎𝟎𝟎  transactions per second (TPS)   without any scaling solutions needed.\n𝐏𝐒 :𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐚 𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 𝟐𝟒𝟎𝟎𝟎 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐩𝐞𝐫 𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐝 𝐨𝐧𝐥𝐲! 😮\nSolana’s 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘳𝘥-𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯  blockchain architecture is designed to facilitate smart contracts and decentralized application (DApp) creation. The project supports an array of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms as well as nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces.\nNow question is 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐬 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐚 𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐪𝐮𝐞?\nSolana’s ambitious design aims to solve the 𝘣𝘭𝘰𝘤𝘬𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘳𝘪𝘭𝘦𝘮𝘮𝘢 , a concept proposed by Ethereum creator 𝘝𝘪𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘬 𝘉𝘶𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘯, in its unique way. This trilemma describes a set of three major challenges that developers face when building blockchains: decentralization, security and scalability.\nIt is widely believed that blockchains are built in such a way that forces developers to sacrifice one of the aspects in favor of the other two, as they can only provide two of the three benefits at any given time.\nThe Solana blockchain platform has proposed a hybrid consensus mechanism that compromises on decentralization to maximize speed. The innovative combination of proof of stake(PoS) and proof of history (PoH) makes Solana a unique project in the blockchain industry.",

In this article, we’ll take a look at the key concepts of the GitHub development workflow for those in tech including working with repositories, branches, forks, commits, pull requests, and merging. Let’s get started!\nVersion control is a system that helps developers track and manage changes to a software projects' code. As projects grow, the need for version control becomes vital — especially in a collaborative project.

          "description": "Anonymous functions are arrow functions (the functions that do not have a name and are not associated with an identifier). They produce no output and can be used without the function keyword. Arrow functions may not be used as constructors. The context of the arrow functions can be specified lexically or statically. In other languages, they are known as Lambda.\nThe use of the arrow function syntax reduces the size of the code. Using the arrow function allows us to write less code.\nIn JavaScript, there are several ways to write a function. You could either define and name a function or define a variable and assign it to an anonymous function.\nExample:\nfunction multiply(a, b) {\n   return a * b;\n}\n\nCan be written as:\nconst multiply = function(a, b){\n   return a * b;\n}\n\nTake note of how we def…",

          "description": "GNOME 43 即将到来。下面是你可以期待在该版本中出现的功能。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nGNOME 43 将于 2022 年 9 月 21 日发布。截至目前，GNOME 43 的测试版已经可供测试。\n\r\n我们在 GNOME 43 测试版中发现的功能和变化应该随着最终版本的发布而到来。\n\r\n那么，哪些是你最值得期待的 GNOME 43 功能呢？\n\r\n让我们来看看一些关键的变化。\n\r\n这个列表集中在视觉/交互式变化上。关于技术变化的完整列表，你可以参考文章底部链接的更新日志。\n\r\n1、改造了快速设置\n\r\n\n\r\nGNOME 桌面菜单位于右上角，你可以在这里快速调整音量、访问网络连接，以及开/关电脑，在这个版本中它终于得到了视觉上的更新。\n\r\n现在，它看起来更像是安卓的快速切换栏，这应该会增强用户体验，同时减少一些多余的点击。\n\r\n\n\r\n你不需要前往设置来打开深色模式和夜光。新的快速切换菜单就可以让你可以访问到它们。\n\r\n此外，像选择 Wi-Fi 网络和改变音频设备这样的事情比以前更容易做到。\n\r\n2、对 Nautilus 文件管理器的改变\n\r\n虽然我们已经在之前的报道中提到了 GNOME 43 中对 Nautilus 最重要的改变。\n\r\n\r\nGNOME 43 中 Nautilus 文件管理器的 6 个新变化\n\r\n\r\n有几件事值得再次重申。其中一些包括：\n\r\n\r\n使用 GTK 4 的全新外观。\n\r\n拖动和选择文件的能力（橡皮筋选择）。\n\r\n紧凑窗口的自适应视图。\n\r\n新的文件上下文菜单。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n总的来说，在 GNOME 43 中，你会发现 Nautilus 文件管理器有了一些视觉上的调整，并有动画的细微改进。\n\r\n你可以点击每一个选项，访问目录的属性等等来探索其中的差异。它应该感觉更直观一些。\n\r\n3、设备安全信息\n\r\n\n\r\n我们之前报道过 GNOME 会在你禁用安全启动时显示警告。\n\r\n\r\n安全启动已被禁用？ GNOME将很快向您发出警告！\n\r\n\r\n你会在你的闪屏和锁屏中看到这个警告。\n\r\nGNOME 的设置菜单也有一个新的 “设备安全” 选项，在这里你可以看到安全启动状态和其他重要信息，比如：\n\r\n\r\nTPM\n\r\n英特尔 BootGuard\n\r\nIOMMU 保护\n\r\n\r\n4、GNOME Web 的扩展支持\n\r\n\n\r\nGNOME Web 在每次更新都会变得更好一些。有了 Web 扩展的支持，它成为了一个有吸引力的选择，可以取代你的日常使用的浏览器。\n\r\n\r\n有了扩展，GNOME Web 正慢慢成为桌面 Linux 上一个有吸引力的选择\n\r\n\r\n在写这篇文章的时候，该支持仍然是 实验性的，你必须得手动安装扩展。\n\r\n对于初学者来说，你可以在 Mozilla Firefox 附加组件门户上下载 .xpi 扩展文件。\n\r\n5、GNOME 软件中心的改进\n\r\nGNOME 的软件中心目前的体验并不是很好。\n\r\n虽然它在提供额外信息方面有所改进，但仍有改进的余地。\n\r\n\n\r\n在 GNOME 43 中，你可以了解到更多关于 Flatpak 应用程序所需的权限。而且，你还可以看到一个 “其他应用程序” 部分，以寻找同一开发者的其它应用程序。\n\r\n此外，软件包来源的显示方式也有了细微的视觉调整。\n\r\n\n\r\n附加：新的墙纸\n\r\n你会得到新的默认壁纸，有深色和浅色的变体。下面是深色壁纸背景的样子：\n\r\n\n\r\n而这是浅色版本：\n\r\n\n\r\n除了主要的亮点之外，其他一些变化包括：\n\r\n\r\nAdwaita 图标主题更新。\n\r\nGNOME 应用程序的性能改进。\n\r\n各种代码的清理。\n\r\n对日历的改进。\n\r\n改良了“关于”窗口。\n\r\n\r\n关于完整的技术细节，你可以参考 GNOME 43 测试版更新日志。\n\r\n总的来说，GNOME 43 在很大程度上注重提高可用性和用户体验。\n\r\n最初还计划了一些有趣的功能，但它们没有进入 GNOME 43。也许，GNOME 44 会包括这些？\n\r\n\r\n这里是开发者为 GNOME 43 规划的内容\n\r\n\r\n你对 GNOME 43 的功能有何看法？请在下面的评论中告诉我们你的想法。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/gnome-43-features/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lkxed 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.\n\n3x3 可以轻松的记录日常的时间线，可以关联每日、周、月、年、甚至人生的待办或者标签，并且待办之间可以进行双向链接\n做3x3的想法就是，过了很多年之后，我还可以方便的找到当天做过有意义的事情\n然后可以将所有事情串联起来，比如我学习一样事情，阅读一本书，可以清晰的知道每个阶段的过程，甚至你可以制作你自己的10000小时计划\n3x3 的设计想法在 2018 年初，就有了，当时我还做了一个简单的网页，它…",

          "description": "在 WWDC22 上，Apple 发布 iOS 16 的时候，公布了一个功能叫实时活动，并向开发者开放 Live Activities API。\n\n那么什么实时活动呢？\n实时活动是一种新的交互式消息通知，用户可以在 iPhone 的锁屏界面看到事件的实时更新。比如球赛的比分、打车或订餐的订单状态、运动锻炼的实时数据等。这种消息通知形式允许开发者在实时活动期间更新单个交互式通知，而不是每次有状态更新时都发送新通知。通过减少发送的通知数量，同时使信息更易于访问。\nUber海外版团队设计的实时活动界面\nApple 在 iOS 16 开发者测试版 Beta 4 首次向开发者提供 ActivityKit 开发套件，首次在真机实装，随后在 Beta 6 和 Beta 7 并没有在真机实装实时活动功能。开发者目前只能在模拟器测试这项功能，或者降级回 Beta 4 或 Beta 5。Apple 在开发者网站也明确表示实时活动不会在首个 iOS16 正式版推出，而是在今年晚些时候的正式版突出。下图是模仿目前已有的原神安卓小组件、iOS 小组件做的实时活动版小组件。到了 8 月 16 日一大早用手机更新 Beta 6 之后，手机就不能运行和测试实时活动了，随后也看到其他开发者反馈实时活动在 Beta 6 版本没有实装。本文后面的截图只能在模拟器截取了，但模拟器不能更改壁纸，只有黑色背景。\nXcode真机调试报错ActivityKit没实装\n实时活动界面部分是小组件扩展，开发者使用 WidgetKit 功能和 SwiftUI 编写界面布局，ActivityKit 是处理配置、启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动是一种消息通知，是一种可以自定义界面布局和更新状态的消息通知。下图是普通类型的消息通知，或许以后能看到换了界面布局的降雨提醒。\n普通的消息通知类型\n实时活动要求和限制\n与小组件不同的是，小组件是通过时间线机制更新界面数据，实时活动是通过远程推送或 ActivityKit 从主应用程序来启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动无法访问网络或接收位置更新，下图网络请求图片失败。\n\nActivityKit 更新和远程推送通知更新的更新动态数据大小不能超过 4KB。\n实时活动界面不能包含可交互元素，例如按钮和 WebView。当用户点击实时活动界面，将会打开主应用程序。\n自定义实时活动的用户界面时，系统会忽略任何自定义动画，但可以使用系统自带的时间文本动画，当实时活动的动态内容发生变化时，系统会执行一些动画。文本视图通过模糊的内容过渡动画内容变化，系统为图像和 SF Symbols 符号动画内容过渡，根据内容或状态更改从用户界面添加或删除视图，视图会淡入淡出。\n系统自带的时间文本动画系统为图像内容变化作出的动画效果\n在开发者网站的描述中，如果实时活动的高度超过 160，系统可能会截断它。在实际测试中，实时活动界面最小高度为 64，最大高度可以达到 220。目前实时活动功能还不是正式的版本，有可能在之后的测试版本会有改变。\n\n当用户在 App 首次启动时，点击允许应用程序发送通知时，就代表允许 App 发送实时活动通知，不允许则不会收到实时活动的通知。之后在系统设置 - 对应的 App -实时活动，可以关闭/开启实时活动权限。\n实时活动权限位置\n实时活动有 4 种活动状态，分别是：等待中、正在进行、成功、失败\n实时活动在锁屏界面显示的时候，用户可以左划，点击清除按钮将其清除。用户没有清除的情况下，实时活动最多可以处于活动状态 8 小时，如果用户或应用程序尚未结束活动状态，系统会自动结束它。在此结束状态下，实时活动会在锁定屏幕上最多保留 4 个小时，最后系统会将其删除。\n\n目前实时活动功能还在测试状态，开发者们还在为他们的 App 设计和测试这一项功能，下图是收集几款目前在测试中的实时活动的例子。\n一些例子展示\n关于实时活动这一功能的一些设想。在这个功能正式上线后，除了官方和大部分媒体提到的比赛比分、运动训练状态、行程状态、订单状态等这些功能以外，我们或许还可以看到这些功能：某餐饮 App 提醒你周四中午吃啥；原神体力、宝钱、参量质变仪到点提示上线领取；购物平台推送提醒商品抢购即将开启、正在抢购还剩余 69 件并且在不断减少等之类的功能。\n\n以上就是关于实时活动这个功能的一些介绍和想法。之前的一篇锁屏天气的文章和视频会有评论说解锁在桌面小组件就能看到天气了啊，左划负一屏添加小组件就能看到天气了啊。不过对于我这种手机懒得解锁的用户来说，对于锁屏实时活动这个功能是非常期待的。大家对于实时活动这个系统特性及功能有什么想法和期待呢？",

How many, perhaps 50 years from now, can look back and say, \"Check out the code I wrote that day that hundreds/thousands/tens of thousands benefited from.\" I find that infinitely more exciting than working on software that's hidden from most of the world.\nI'm fortunate that my job puts me in the middle of an interesting area where open …",

The LG OLED Flex (model LX3) is a 42-inch OLED TV that bends into a curved (900R) TV thanks to LG’s latest display technology. Curved displays are suited for a more immersive gaming experience, while flat screens are better for watching TV broadcasts or streaming services.\nLG OLED Flex owners can automatically bend and adjust the TV into its curved mode using a dedicated button on the TV remote. (As opposed to some morphing monitors which have to be manually adjusted). There are two presets or owners can adjust the curve of the display in five percent increments through 20 different levels.\nImage: LG\n      LG is...\n  \nContinue reading…",

          "description": "Ness Labs. Two years ago, I discovered Roam, and today couldn’t imagine managing my studies and my work without it.\n\nSince then, there’s been a renaissance of Tools for Thought – apps to improve your productivity, your creativity and your thinking – but it’s become hard to decide which tool to use, and how to safely transfer your notes if you decide to switch between two tools.\n\nThat’s why I created Switchboard, the most comprehensive collection of tutorials for you to safely make the switch from a Tool for Thought to another! 🥳\n\nInside each Switchboard tutorial, you’ll find:\n\n• Why you may want to switch to the new tool\n• The reasons why you may be better off sticking to your current tool (shiny toy syndrome!)\n• If you do decide to make the switch, how to safely export your notes from one tool to another\n• Tips to quickly get used to your new Tool for Thought\n\nThanks to @anthilemoon for the support over the past few months while I was working on this project. We’ll keep on adding more tutorials, so let me know if there’s one you want us to create!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

This gives you full access to the response body for HTML rewrites and page data transforms. \n\n💬 Unique workflow for QA and feedback: When you open a pull request, Netlify generates a deploy preview you can use both for QA and to gather feedback from your team. When stakeholders leave on-page feedback their comments sync directly to the place where your team works, like GitHub, GitLab, JIRA, Trello, or Linear. This even works for content generated by ISR and SSR! \n\nHere are some links to learn more:\n\n- A better runtime for Next.js: https://www.netlify.com/blog/nextjs-advanced-middleware-better-runtime-that-extends-nextjs/\n\n- Next.js on Netlify Docs: https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/next-js/overview/\n\n- Starter templates and resources: https://www.netlify.com/with/nextjs/\n\nTo sum it up: Netlify's new Next.js Runtime and Next.js Advanced Middleware give developers the power to achieve personalization use cases like localization or custom authentication in a way that requires less developer effort and delivers superior performance for end-users.\n\nThis is only the first release for Netlify's Next.js Runtime. Expect more to come in the future! \n\nWe’re so excited to share this moment with the Product Hunt community and would love to hear from you. What questions do you have? Could you imagine using Next.js Advanced Middleware for an upcoming project? What new features would you like to see from Netlify? \n\nThank you for checking this out and joining the conversation!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "@PengyiWang. We are very excited to launch this on Product Hunt today.\n\n🟢 What it is:\nThe Shopify Plus Calculator is a calculator that calculates the cost of moving your Shopify store to Shopify Plus. It’s primarily used by Shopify merchants who are already doing volume on their store, but are not sure if Plus makes sense for them yet.\n\n🔵 Why we built it:\nWorking with ecommerce companies over the past years, we've experienced the power of Shopify Plus. The paltform powers some of the most beloved brands. Shopify adds a ton of innovation to it, which remains unaccessible for non Plus merchants. The cost of upgrading can be hard to figure out (SaaS fee + transaction fees + feature gains). It's confusing for most merchants who are curious.\n\n🟣 How it works:\n1. Enter your store metrics: orders/month, AOV, current plan, transaction processor\n2. Choose monthly or yearly billing\n3. See the cost breakdown per plan\n4. The conclusion shows the gross and net cost of upgrading to Shopify Plus\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
