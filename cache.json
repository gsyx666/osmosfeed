Mongo DB is the only NoSQL database ranking that high from the list. \nMongoDB offers many advantages over traditional relational databases.  With MongoDB Atlas, the cloud offering by MongoDB, you have access to a collection of services that all integrate nicely with your database.\nI love this feature and as a software developer, I use Mongo DB for this reason. \nThis feature provides high performance (speed) and makes it easy to accommodate product scalability(growth). It's cost-effective as you will always find a plan that suits your project need and production budget. \nMongoDB supports creating clearer schemas and data validation. This flexibility is an incredible asset when handling real-world data and changes in production requirements or environments.\nHope this helps anyone out there thinking of what database to use for the next project!",

If you use Kubernetes, here’s how you can find any cloud cost anomalies in three simple steps.\nStep 1: Analyze your cloud bill for the last month\nTake a look at your cloud bill from the last month, and you’ll instantly see why it’s so hard to understand. Cloud providers charge on the basis of various service metrics. For example, some resources in the AWS Simple Storage Service charge by the number of requests, while others use GB.\nTo make sense of your usage and costs, you must look into various areas in your provider console.

          "description": "Suppose that you run a software development agency and you want to enforce a common linting rule set and formatting guidelines for all of your JavaScript projects. You could install ESLint and Prettier in each of your projects. However, your company manages more than a hundred different projects, with custom rules for both ESLint and Prettier. So, if you decide to add or deprecate some rules, you'll have to update the rule sets in all of those projects.\nA monorepo can help solve this issue. You can put all of your configuration code in a master repository, publish it as an npm package, and then import the npm package into your projects. Next time you want to change the rules, you only need to alter the monorepo project and the change will be reflected in all of your projects, as they're dependent on the monorepo project.\nIf you follow the steps in this tutorial, you’ll see how you can publish NPM packages using Lerna and keep your packages’ code in a monorepo.\nRead the full blog on Fusebit.\nThanks for reading 💜\nI publish a monthly newsletter in which I share personal stories, things that I am working on, what is happening in the world of tech, and some interesting dev-related posts which I come across while surfing the web.\nConnect with me through Twitter • LinkedIn • GitHub or send me an Email.\n— Ravgeet, Full Stack Developer and Technical Content Writer",

It is aimed at making it easy for open-source project contributors to manage operational maintenance, and enable open-source communities to embrace cloud-native DevOps. GitHub Actions is integrated into most of my open-source projects including Crawlab and ArtiPub. As a contributor, I think GitHub Actions is not only easy to use, but also free (which is the most important). Therefore, I hope this article will allow open-source project contributors who are not familiar with GitHub Actions, to really get ideas on how to utilize it and make an impact.\nFor those who are not familiar with GitHub Actions, it is strongly recommended that you read the official documentation first, where you can find Introducti…",

          "description": "微软与 Meta 合作，将 Teams、Office、Windows 和 Xbox 带到 VR\n\r\n在今天的 Meta Connect 会议上，微软 CEO 萨提亚·纳德拉表示，该公司正在与 Meta 合作，将其最大的服务，Teams、Office、Windows，甚至 Xbox 云游戏，带到 Meta 的 Quest VR 头盔上。人们将能够直接从 Meta 的 Horizon 工作间加入 Teams 会议，也可以在 Quest VR 头盔里面使用 Windows 365，获得 Windows 的完整体验，包括所有个性化的应用程序、内容和设置。此外，微软还通过 PWA 技术将 Office 应用的 2D 版本带到 Quest VR 头盔。甚至，Xbox 云游戏也将进入 Quest VR 头盔，虽然不会像 Xbox 原生 VR 体验那样令人沉浸，但你将能够拿起 Xbox 控制器，在头盔内的巨大屏幕上玩这些游戏。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Verge\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：微软的这一合作，对 Meta 的元宇宙愿景来说可谓一剂强心针。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n美国能源科学网络 ESnet6 带宽升至 46Tbps\n\r\n成立于 1986 年的美国能源科学网络 ESnet，旨在帮助美国能源部的科学家们打通旗下各个实验室，使之能够快速共享大量原始数据。它由横跨全美的 2.4 万公里的专用光缆组成。随着该网络完成 ESnet6 更新，美国最快的互联网带宽也飙升到了 46 Tbps。2021 年的时候，通过 ESnet 网络传输的数据量，就已经达到了惊人的 1.1 EB。不过，在实验性网络中的最高传输速度的记录是日本创造的 1 Pbps，即 1000 Tbps。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：伯克利实验室\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这要是传个小电影得多快啊~\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n新西兰计划对农场动物打嗝、撒尿征税\n\r\n据央视新闻，新西兰政府 11 日提议对农场动物打嗝、撒尿排放的温室气体征税，以应对气候变化。新西兰政府表示，该项税收是世界首创，将从 2025 年开始征收，税价未定。新西兰约一半的温室气体排放来自农场，包括牛打嗝产生的甲烷和尿液中所含的一氧化二氮。此前，新西兰政府 2003 年提出征收农场动物的“放屁税”计划，遭到农场主反对，最终告吹。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：每经报\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：不是没有道理，但是为什么我觉得这么搞笑。",

          "description": "更新 Linux 系统并没有那么复杂，不是吗？毕竟，要更新 Ubuntu 之类的发行版，你只需要使用 apt update 和 apt upgrade 就行。\n\r\n如果所有的包都是通过一个包管理器安装的，就会是这样。\n\r\n但现在情况不再如此。你有经典的 apt/dnf/pacman，还有 Snap、Flatpak、Appimages。不止于此，你还可以使用 PIP（用于 Python）和 Cargo（用于 Rust）安装应用。\n\r\n使用 Node？ NPM 包需要单独更新。Oh My Zsh？需要单独更新。Vim 中的插件、Atom 等也可能不被 apt/dnf/pacman 覆盖。\n\r\n你现在看到问题了吗？这就是名为 Topgrade 的新工具旨在解决的问题。\n\r\nTopgrade：处理各种更新的单一程序\n\r\nTopgrade 是一个 CLI 程序，它会检测你使用的工具，然后运行适当的命令来更新它们。\n\r\n\n\r\n除了通常的 Linux 包管理器，它还可以检测和更新 Brew、Cargo、PIP、Pihole、Vim 和 Emacs 插件、R 软件包等。你可以在 维基页面 上查看支持的包列表。\n\r\nTopgrade 的主要特点：\n\r\n\r\n能够更新来自不同的包管理器的软件包，包括固件！\n\r\n你可以如何控制更新包。\n\r\n高度可定制。\n\r\n甚至能够在更新包之前进行概览。\n\r\n\r\n所以不要浪费任何时间，让我们跳到安装。\n\r\n使用 Cargo 在 Linux 中安装 Topgrade\n\r\n安装过程非常简单，因为我将使用 Cargo 包管理器。\n\r\n我们已经有了 详细指南，其中包含设置 Cargo 包管理器的多种方法。所以我将在我的示例中使用 Ubuntu 来快速完成。\n\r\n因此，让我们以最少方式安装依赖项以及 Cargo：\n\r\nsudo apt install cargo libssl-dev pkg-config\r\n\n\r\n安装 Cargo 后，使用给定的命令安装 Topgrade：\n\r\ncargo install topgrade\r\n\n\r\n它会抛出一个警告：\n\r\n\n\r\n你只需添加 cargo 路径即可运行二进制文件。这可以通过给定的命令来完成，你需要使用你的用户名替换 sagar：\n\r\necho 'export PATH=$PATH:/home/sagar/.cargo/bin' >> /home/sagar/.bashrc\r\n\n\r\n现在，重启系统，Topgrade 就可以使用了。但是等等，我们需要安装另一个包来更新 Cargo 以获取最新的包。\n\r\ncargo install cargo-update\r\n\n\r\n这样我们完成了安装。\n\r\n使用 Topgrade\n\r\n使用 Topgrade 非常简单。使用一个命令，就是这样：\n\r\ntopgrade\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n但这不会给你除了系统包之外的任何控制，但正如我所提到的，你可以将不想更新的仓库列入黑名单。\n\r\n从 Topgrade 中排除包管理器和仓库\n\r\n假设我想排除 Snap 和从默认包管理器下载的包，所以我的命令是：\n\r\ntopgrade --disable snap system\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n要进行永久更改，你必须在其配置文件中进行一些更改，这些更改可以通过给定的命令访问：\n\r\ntopgrade --edit-config\r\n\n\r\n对于此示例，我排除了 Snap 和默认系统仓库：\n\r\n\n\r\n试运行 Topgrade\n\r\n评估将要更新的过时软件包总是一个好主意，我从 Topgrade 的整个目录中找到了这个最有用的选项。\n\r\n你只需使用带有 -n 选项的 topgrade 命令，它就会生成过期软件包的摘要。\n\r\ntopgrade -n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n检查需要更新的软件包的一种简洁方法。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n在使用 Topgrade 几周后，它成为了我的 Linux 武器库中不可或缺的一部分。 像大多数其他 Linux 用户一样，我只是通过我的默认包管理器更新包。 Python 和 Rust 包被完全忽略了。 感谢 Topgrade，我的系统现在完全更新了。\n\r\n我知道这不是每个人都想使用的工具。那你呢？愿意试一试吗？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/topgrade/\n\r\n作者：Sagar Sharma 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

You can't avoid async programming to create a fast and reactive application.

Tasks can be executed in the background while the user still makes inputs. Async programming is possible in many languages, each with different styles and syntax. Rust is no exception.

          "description": "Image: Microsoft\n    \n\n  \nMicrosoft is bringing GPU decompression to Windows PC games soon. After launching DirectStorage earlier this year, GPU decompression promises to be the next step in the ongoing effort to improve game load times on PCs. Microsoft says it’s “one of our most highly requested features” from game developers.\nGPU decompression works by offloading the work needed to decompress assets in games to the graphics card instead of the CPU. Modern games include massive amounts of assets like characters, landscapes, and objects that are all compressed to reduce the total size of a game. \n“Typically, decompression work is done on the CPU because compression formats have historically been optimized for CPUs only,” explains Cassie Hoef, a senior program...\nContinue reading…",

To demonstrate this groundbreaking technical achievement, Zuckerberg’s digital avatar lifted each leg in the air, then did a jump, while Aigerim Shorman’s avatar kicked into the air.\nIt may have all been for show. According to UploadVR editor Ian Hamilton, an unnamed Meta spokesperson said that the “the segment featured animations created from motion capture,” meant to “enable this preview of what’s to come.” To me that reads like what we saw wasn’t actually a demo of what Horizon’s legs will look like, but rather an artist’s interpretation of what Horizon’s legs may end up looking...\nContinue reading…",
