          "description": "Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.\nIn our applications we can differentiate between two types of classes:\nLow level classes which do operations like reading from a database or saving a file.\nHigh level classes which implement the business logic and use those low level classes.\nWhat this principle proposes is that high level classes depend on interfaces instead of concrete implementations. This is easier to understand with an example.\nIn the following bad example we have the OrderService class that saves orders in a database. The OrderService class depends directly on the low level class MySQLDatabase.\nIf in the future we wanted to change the database that we are using we would have to modify the OrderService class.\nclass OrderService {\n  database: MySQLDatabase;\n\n  // constructor\n\n  save(order: Order): void {\n    if (order.id === undefined) {\n      this.database.insert(order);\n    } else {\n      this.database.update(order);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass MySQLDatabase {\n  insert(order: Order) {\n    // insert\n  }\n\n  update(order: Order) {\n    // update\n  }\n}\n\nWe can improve this by creating an interface and make the OrderService class dependant of it. This way, we are inverting the dependency. Now the high level class depends on an abstraction instead of a low level class.\nclass OrderService {\n  database: Database;\n\n  // constructor\n\n  save(order: Order): void {\n    this.database.save(order);\n  }\n}\n\ninterface Database {\n  save(order: Order): void;\n}\n\nclass MySQLDatabase implements Database {\n  save(order: Order) {\n    if (order.id === undefined) {\n      // insert\n    } else {\n      // update\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNow we can add new databases without modifying the OrderService class.",

Due to it tends customer-oriented, people pursue to be agile over the changes, communicative, and critical. There are so many ways or methods to approach the Agile such as Scrum, or you even could create yours – depends on your situations.\n\nIf the Waterfall runs linear from planning until maintenance which means it cannot go to the previous step. On the other hand, the Agile could revisit the previous step before continuing the next step. It could be happened because every person could give feedback on the task. In addition, every process must be under customer agreement or confirmation. \nPeople in the team actively collaborate in cross functionality. At the end of the day, the product results end up with minimum risks.\nIn Scrum method, a product is delivered in a few smaller parts in the sprint planning meetings – followed by retrospective meetings. Also, it should involves a Scrum Master. \nA little addition, CI/CD pipeline implementation in the Agile SDLC would be very helpful. Whenever a feature ready to be integrated, it immediately could be delivered and deployed to the production, or any environment you want.\nReferences:\nhttps://www.northeastern.edu\nhttps://www.atlassian.com\nhttps://customerthink.com",

What differentiates shrimp from the aws cli is that it allows the user to dynamically change the bandwidth limit during the upload, and it lets the user pause the upload and resume it later.

          "description": "在 2020 年 SolarWinds 网络间谍活动之后，一系列进一步的软件供应链漏洞凸显了确保软件监管链安全的必要性。在这场间谍活动中，俄罗斯黑客渗透到一个广泛使用的 IT 管理平台，并将受污染的升级程序悄悄带入其中。由于开源项目从根本上来说是分散的，而且经常是临时的活动，因此在这种背景下，这个问题尤其紧迫。GitHub 著名的 npm 注册中心广泛使用的 JavaScript 软件包遭到一系列令人不安的黑客攻击后，该公司前不久公布了一项战略，以提供更好的开源安全保护。\n\r\n代码签名平台 Sigstore 将由微软旗下的 GitHub 支持，以用于 npm 软件包。代码签名类似于数字蜡封。为了让开源维护者更加容易地确认他们编写的代码是否与全球范围内人们实际下载的软件包中最终包含的代码相同，跨行业协作促成了该工具的创建。\n\r\nGitHub 并不是开源生态系统的唯一组成部分，但 Sigstore 的联合开发者、Chainguard 的首席执行官 Dan Lorenc 指出，它是社区的一个重要枢纽，因为绝大多数项目都在这里存储和共享源代码。然而，当开发人员真正想下载开源软件或工具时，他们通常会通过软件包管理进行。\n\r\n通过让包管理器可以使用 Sigstore，开发人员可以在 Sigstore 工具的帮助下，在软件通过供应链时处理加密检查和要求。这增加了产品流通过程中每个阶段的透明度。Lorenc 说，许多人在得知这些完整性检查尚未实施时感到震惊，开源生态系统中相当大的一部分长期以来一直依赖于盲目的信心。拜登政府于 2021 年 5 月发布了一项行政命令，主要涉及软件供应链安全问题。\n\r\nLinux 基金会、谷歌、红帽、Purdue Universit 和 Chainguard 都对 Sigstore 的开发做出了贡献。现在有了使用 Sigstore 为 Python 包发行版签名的官方软件，而且开发软件的开源环境 Kubernetes 现在也支持它。\n\r\nSigstore 依靠免费和简单易用来鼓励采用，就像主要行业推动 HTTPS 网络加密一样，这在很大程度上是由非营利组织互联网安全研究组Internet Security Research Group的 Let's Encrypt 等工具实现的。据 GitHub 称，该项目会首先提出 Sigstore 将如何在 npm 中实现的建议，并在开放评论期征求社区人员对该工具的精确部署策略的意见。然而，最终的目标是让这样的代码签名能够被尽可能多的开源项目使用，从而让对供应链的攻击更加困难。\n\r\nGitHub 的 Hutchings 说：“我们希望看到这样一个世界，最终所有的软件工件都被签名并链接回源代码，这就是为什么构建像 Sigstore 这样的开放技术栈是如此重要，其他打包存储库也可以采用这种技术。”\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/08/github-takes-action-to-prevent-supply-chain-attacks-on-open-source/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：lzx916 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "本教程介绍了如何实时监控 Linux 日志文件（桌面、服务器或应用）以进行诊断和故障排除。\n\r\n\r\n当你在 Linux 桌面、服务器或任何应用中遇到问题时，你首先会查看单独的日志文件。日志文件通常是文本流和来自应用的带有时间戳的消息。它可以帮助你缩小特定问题的范围，并使你能够找到问题的原因。它还可以帮助从网络获得帮助。\n\r\n一般来说，所有的日志文件都位于 /var/log。此目录包含特定应用和服务的扩展名为 .log 的日志文件，它还包含了其他含有日志的独立目录。\n\r\n\n\r\n所以，如果你想监控一堆日志文件或特定的一个，这里有一些方法可以做到。\n\r\nLinux 实时监控日志文件\n\r\n使用 tail 命令\n\r\ntail 命令是实时跟踪日志文件的最基本方式。特别是如果你在只有终端而没有 GUI 的服务器中。这很有帮助。\n\r\n基本语法如下：\n\r\ntail /path/to/log/file\r\n\n\r\n用法：\n\r\n\n\r\n可以使用开关 -f 跟踪实时更新的日志文件。例如，如果要关注 syslog，可以使用以下命令。\n\r\ntail -f /var/log/syslog\r\n\n\r\n你可以使用单个命令监控多个日志文件：\n\r\ntail -f /var/log/syslog /var/log/dmesg\r\n\n\r\n如果要监视 HTTP 或 sftp 或任何服务器，可以在此命令中使用它们各自的日志文件。\n\r\n请记住，上述命令需要管理员权限。\n\r\n使用 lnav（日志文件浏览器）\n\r\n\n\r\nlnav 是一个出色的程序，你可以用它来用彩色编码的信息以更有条理的方式监控日志文件。在 Linux 系统中，这个工具不是默认安装的。你可以用下面的命令来安装它：\n\r\nUbuntu：\n\r\nsudo apt install lnav\r\n\n\r\nFedora：\n\r\nsudo dnf install lnav\r\n\n\r\nlnav 的好处在于，如果你不想安装它，你可以下载其预编译的可执行文件并在任何地方运行它，甚至可以从 U 盘上运行。无需设置，并加载了功能。使用 lnav，你可以通过 SQL 查询日志文件，以及其他很酷的功能，你可以在其官方网站上学习。\n\r\n安装后，你可以在具有管理员权限的终端上运行 lnav，它会默认显示 /var/log 中的所有日志并开始实时监控。\n\r\n关于 systemd 的 journalctl 的一个说明\n\r\n当今所有现代 Linux 发行版都主要使用 systemd。 systemd 提供了运行 Linux 操作系统的基本框架和组件。 systemd 通过 journalctl 提供日志服务，这有助于管理来自所有 systemd 服务的日志。你还可以使用以下命令实时监控各个 systemd 服务和日志。\n\r\njournalctl -f\r\n\n\r\n以下是一些特定的 journalctl 命令，可用于多种情况。你可以将这些与上面的 -f 选项结合使用以开始实时监控。\n\r\n对于紧急系统消息，请使用：\n\r\njournalctl -p 0\r\n\n\r\n显示带有解释的错误：\n\r\njournalctl -xb -p 3\r\n\n\r\n使用时间控制过滤：\n\r\njournalctl --since \"2022-12-04 06:00:00\"\r\njournalctl --since \"2022-12-03\" --until \"2022-12-05 03:00:00\"\r\njournalctl --since yesterday\r\njournalctl --since 09:00 --until \"1 hour ago\"\r\n\n\r\n如果你想了解更多关于 journalctl 的详细信息，我已经在这写了份 指南。\n\r\n结束语\n\r\n我希望这些命令和技巧可以帮助你找到桌面或服务器中问题/错误的根本原因。有关更多详细信息，你可以随时参考手册页并使用各种选项。如果你对本文有任何意见或想法，请使用下面的评论栏告诉我。\n\r\n干杯。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/monitor-log-files-real-time/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

During the video, Park drives a Tesla Model 3 toward one of his children standing in the road, and then tries again with his other kid crossing the street. The vehicle stops before reaching the children both times.\nDoes...\nContinue reading…",

Starting off, Woot has excellent prices for some of Sony’s top-of-the-line headphones — both for those who prefer over-ear cans and true wireless earbuds.\nYou may be no stranger to the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones, and for good reason, as they were our top pick for the best headphones you can buy for quite a while. Their title has been usurped by the newer and pricier WH-1000XM5, but the XM4 remains an excellent option with great sound quality, noise cancellation, and the ability to fold down for easier storage (a glaring omission of the new model’s revised design).\nWoot is offering the WH-1000XM4 headphones for a one-day deal price of $269.99 (about $80 off), but...\nContinue reading…",

She also noted another test feature showing view counts for tweets, which some users already have access to for their own tweets under the label of “analytics.” However, she said it’s unclear if this would be limited to the author or visible to everyone.\nLinking an account to a number is one way to highlight that it was created with more effort than the simplest macro and could be used to filter out which tweets appear the most prominently or...\nContinue reading…",

I often ignore adding contact or feedback forms on most of my sites to avoid the hassle of setting forms.\n\nSo I thought if there's a free tool that lets me embed contact forms on any number of sites without writing code and just in a few steps, it would be great!\n\nThat's where this 𝑓𝗈𝗋𝗆𝗂𝖿𝗒 idea came to me.\n\n𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘂𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀:\n1. Ability to add different emails for different forms to receive notification\n2. Enhance the form script and add multiple color themes for users to select.\n3.
