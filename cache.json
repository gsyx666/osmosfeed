Sometimes, our choice of units when styling could backfire when our webpage is viewed on another screen. Situations like this make us fall back to media queries to save the day, because why not? How would I expect one CSS dimension to fit several viewports?

          "description": "Technical explanation\n\n\nThe box-sizing property determines how the width and height of an element is calculated.\nbox-sizing only accepts two values: content-box and border-box.\nbox-sizing default value is content-box which means that the width of an element is calculated in the following way:\nactual width = width + border-left + border-right + padding-left + padding-right\nThis way it's sometimes hard to calculate the actual width of an element, specially when using relative values.\nIn the following example we are using content-box by default. The child element has a width of 100%, a border of 8px and a padding of 4px. The actual width is calculated in the following way (you can inspect the element to check it):\nactual width = width 100% + border 8px + padding 4px\n\nInstead, if we change box-sizing to border-box the width of the element will take into account the padding and borders. The child component still has a width of 100%, a border of 8px and a padding of 4px, but the actual width is 100%.\n\nAt the bottom of the article in my website you can play with the following interactive example to see how the width of the child component changes depending on the value of box-sizing.\nMDN box-sizing",

          "description": "Are you looking to build a WebRTC application? If so, you may be questioning how much it will cost.\nA few factors will affect your project's cost, including the size and complexity of your project, the platform you're building for, and the developers/firm you're working with.\nThe use of WebRTC for voice and video eases the cost determination difficulties. There are no hidden or extra associated costs. It will be easier to determine the price if you migrate from your proprietary system to WebRTC. Here, Web application development services come in handy too.\nThe five areas of cost estimation for a WebRTC project are:\nImplementation\nTraining\nMaintenance\nLicenses\nTransactions\nSubscription\nBandwidth\nThe following explanation assumes that a typical RTC project has been developed with a proprieta…",

          "description": "Stable Diffusion 是一个“文本到图像”的人工智能模型。近日，Stable AI 公司向公众开放了它的预训练模型权重。当输入一个文字描述时，Stable Diffusion 可以生成 512×512 像素的图像，这些图像如相片般真实，反映了文字描述的场景。\n\r\n这个项目先是经历了早期的代码发布，而后又向研究界有限制地发布了模型权重，现在模型权重已经向公众开放。对于最新版本，任何人都可以在为普通消费者设计的硬件上下载和使用 Stable Diffusion。该模型不仅支持文本到图像的生成，而且还支持图像到图像的风格转换和放大。与之一同发布的还有 DreamStudio 测试版，这是一个用于该模型的 API 和 Web 用户界面。\n\r\nStable AI 公司表示：\n\r\n\r\n“Stable Diffusion 是一个文本到图像的模型，它将使数十亿人在几秒钟内创造出令人惊叹的艺术。它在速度和质量上的突破意味着它可以在消费者级的 GPU 上运行。这将允许研究人员和公众在一系列条件下运行它，并使图像生成普及化。我们期待着有围绕这个模型和其他模型的开放生态系统出现，以真正探索潜伏空间的边界。”\n\r\n\r\nLatent Diffusion 模型（LDM）是 Stable Diffusion 模型建立的一种图像生成方法。LDM 通过在潜伏表示空间latent representation space中迭代“去噪”输入来创建图像，然后将表示解码为完整的图像，这与其他著名的图像合成技术，如生成对抗网络（GAN）和 DALL-E 采用的自动回归方法不同。最近的 IEEE/CVF 计算机视觉和模式识别会议（CVPR）上有一篇关于 LDM 的论文，它是由慕尼黑路德维希-马克西米利安大学的机器视觉和学习研究小组创建的。今年早些时候，InfoQ 也报道的另一个基于扩散的图片生成 AI 是谷歌的 Imagen 模型。\n\r\nStable Diffusion 可以支持众多的操作。与 DALL-E 类似，它可以生成一个高质量的图像，并使其完全符合所需图像的文字描述。我们也可以使用一个直观的草图和所需图像的文字描述，从而创建一个看起来很真实的图像。类似的“图像到图像”的能力可以在 Meta AI 的 Make-A-Scene 模型中找到，该模型刚发布不久。\n\r\n一些人公开分享了 Stable Diffusion 创建的照片的例子，Stable AI 的首席开发人员 Katherine Crowson 也在 Twitter 上分享了许多照片。毫无疑问，基于人工智能的图片合成技术将对艺术家和艺术界产生影响，这令一些观察家感到担忧。值得注意的是，在 Stable Diffusion 发布的同一周，一幅由人工智能生成的作品在科罗拉多州博览会的艺术竞赛中获得了最高荣誉。\n\r\nStable Diffusion 的源代码可以在 GitHub 上查阅。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/09/image-generation-model-stable-diffusion-is-now-open-source/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：lkxed 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "九年前，也是这个上午，我创建了 LCTT 及其第一个项目 TranslateProject。从最初只是有感于 Unix/Linux 上的中文手册页实在太糟糕，希望做一些事情；到最后变成了一个以翻译国外各个开源社区的技术文章和开源资讯/讨论的“流水”式项目，LCTT 已经走过了令我自己都非常吃惊的九年。\n\r\n人的一生，几十年而已，能在一件事上持续投入九年时光，这是我从未想过的事情。驻足回望，LCTT 其实并没有完成我最初的想法，这是缺憾；但是 LCTT 就这样变成了另外一种并非在我计划中的样子，或许也有其必然性。现在看来，LCTT 做了一些事情，也有一些存在的意义。我试着总结一下：\n\r\nLCTT 的主项目 TranslateProject，选题广泛，参与门槛低，从某种意义上，为初识开源的小伙伴提供一种成为开源贡献者的方式。一些人就是通过这个项目，迈出了成为开源贡献者的第一步，并在日后的学习和工作中，成为了开源爱好者、专业技术人员。\n\r\nLCTT 持续翻译了数千篇（截至今日，已经翻译发布了 6395 篇文章），这些文章的专业程度横跨了入门到精通等不同难度，内容方向涉猎了开发、运维、使用和文化等各个方面。虽然，有些文章仅堪一读，但也有不少文章值得收藏、一再细读。我屡屡能从读者那里得到反馈，这些文章对他们提供了很大的帮助，我想这就是 LCTT 的存世价值之一吧。唯独可惜的是，这些文章，没有以很好的方式组织起来，甚憾。\n\r\nLCTT 有数百成员（截至今日，成功地在仓库中进行了贡献的贡献者有 311 位），他们的年龄不等，最年轻的有初中的学生、最老的，嗯这个不需要说了；他们的职业各异，比较多的是大学生，也有很多从事技术工作的专业人员，甚至还有完全不从事技术工作的贡献者。但是，他们都有一个共同的身份就是 LCTT 贡献者，因此，他们都有很多开源兄弟姐妹。\n\r\n按照惯例，每两年，我会写一篇…",

          "description": "如果你在笔记本电脑上使用 Ubuntu，你可能已经注意到当你合上盖子时系统处于挂起状态。\n\r\n这是预期的行为。它可以节省电池和你的工作。你掀开盖子，系统唤醒，你可以登录并继续工作。\n\r\n这一切听起来都不错，除非你使用多显示器设置。像我这样的一些人更喜欢关闭笔记本电脑，只使用外接显示器。\n\r\n但是，如果关闭笔记本电脑盖会挂起系统，那么会产生问题。\n\r\n让我告诉你如何改变这种行为。\n\r\n关闭笔记本电脑盖时不要挂起\n\r\n实际上，我注意到最近的 Ubuntu 版本在这个情况下更智能。当笔记本电脑连接到扩展坞并合上盖子时，它不会进入挂起模式。\n\r\n这是正常的预期行为，但由于 Ubuntu 某种神才知道的原因，它可能不会一直有效。\n\r\n好消息是你可以使用 GUI 和命令行强制更改此行为。\n\r\n让我分享这两种方法。\n\r\n方法 1：使用 GNOME 优化\n\r\n如果你使用的是默认的 GNOME 桌面，那么你很幸运。 在 Ubuntu 的软件中心安装 GNOME 优化（Tweaks）工具，或使用以下命令：\n\r\nsudo apt install gnome-tweaks\r\n\n\r\n安装后，启动优化应用。在侧边栏的常规General选项卡中，关闭“笔记本电脑盖合上时挂起Suspend when laptop lid is closed”按钮。\n\r\n\n\r\n这就好了。你不需要重启即可使更改生效。\n\r\n现在，让我们谈谈命令行方法。\n\r\n方法 2：更改登录配置（针对高级用户）\n\r\n如果你查看文件 /etc/systemd/logind.conf 的内容，你将看到三种不同类型的笔记本电脑合盖默认设置：\n\r\n\r\nHandleLidSwitch=suspend：当笔记本电脑使用电池供电时，合盖挂起\n\r\nHandleLidSwitchExternalPower=suspend：当笔记本电脑插入电源插座时，合盖挂起\n\r\nHandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore：当笔记本电脑连接到扩展坞时，合盖忽略\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n如你所见，如果合上盖子，笔记本电脑将挂起，无论它是否连接到电源。而连接扩展坞忽略合盖。\n\r\n如果需要，你可以根据自己的喜好将这些参数的值更改为其中之一：\n\r\n\r\nsuspend：合盖时挂起\n\r\nlock：合盖时锁定\n\r\nignore：什么都不做\n\r\npoweroff：关机\n\r\nhibernate：合盖时休眠\n\r\n\r\n如果你不希望你的系统在笔记本电脑盖合上时执行任何特殊操作，我建议你使用 ignore。\n\r\n你可以编辑 /etc/systemd/logind.conf 文件，或者在 /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d 目录中创建一个新文件，并取消注释上述设置并更改其值。如果此目录不存在，请创建此目录。\n\r\n我不会给你确切的命令。如果你熟悉命令行，你应该可以做到。如果你对命令行感到不习惯，请使用前面的 GUI 方法。\n\r\n我希望这可以帮助你。如果你有任何问题，请告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/laptop-lid-suspend-ubuntu/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "这个周末又被封在家里了，去不了咖啡厅工作，客厅里唯一的办公位被麦嫂占领，两个孩子也很无聊，跑老跑去不得消停。于是，我也选择躺平了，一天睡两觉，醒了就刷视频、看电影。但偶尔又会想起公司的事；疫情各地物流受阻，电商收入又要受到影响；定好的品牌视频拍摄，可能又要因为疫情而延期；想着想着，心中又开始焦虑了，就这样在躺平、焦虑，焦虑、躺平之间反反复复，心情更差了。\n其实回头想想，在整个创业过程中，这点焦虑都属于家常便饭，但大部分人可能会困在焦虑之中，难以自拔。今天就聊聊我曾经最焦虑的几个阶段，也许能给大家一点参考吧。\n2015 年，为了公司业务转型，我开始尝试寻找投资人。性格内向且缺乏经验的我，除了要面对外部的各种质疑，还有应对内部的复杂关系，老股东该如何安顿？合伙人该怎样分配？每一次谈话，每一次邮件发出之后，都会让我无比焦虑。那段时间，我经常无意识的在街上暴走，或者去海边呐喊宣泄，情绪一直处于过山车状态，非常抑郁。直到融资搞定之后，我安排的第一件事是去医院做了全面体检，特别担心身体会出现大问题。\n焦虑归焦虑，真正解决问题的方法，还是要不停的尝试，通过理性沟通处理各方的诉求，该留的留，该走的走。突破自己原有的圈层，放开性格包袱，去寻找更多的可能性。所以，最终的融资不是来自投资公司，而是来自客户、同行和用户。\n2017 年，迎来了又一次创业考验，好不容易融到的一点钱，很快就花完了，马上就要进入发不出工资的窘境。现在想想其实也怪自己，拿到投资的一年时间里，过度的沉醉于资本市场逻辑当中，把大部分精力放在 BP 故事里，忽略了公司管理和业务聚焦，且一度自我感觉良好。\n此刻摆在眼前只有两条路：要么想尽一切办法支撑下去，要么选择清算并关闭公司。但这两条路都很难。不能再指望外人援助，靠自己就只能抵押房子，一旦失败，全家归零。想想已经积累数年的内容、用户、品牌，如果选择结束，也很难再有这样的机会了。何况我们确实做着正确且有价值的事情，只是我们还没有掌握更好的商业模式。\n一边筹措资金，一边送走部分团队，一边重新走出去约见客户。让客户了解我们的内在价值，哪怕是很小的客户，哪怕没有预算也无所谓，做好服务，以真诚换真诚。因为有前面的积累，加上团队的努力，半年之后，公司就能自己运转了。\n2020 年，公司业务已经稳定了，且略有盈余，我也终于还完了大部分贷款，总算可以轻装上阵。没想到春节刚过，新冠疫情全面爆发，全体成员隔离在家。刚刚起步的电商业务，直接就休克，客户拜访计划也全都暂停。说内心不慌是不可能的，焦虑情绪也开始了，但天灾面前，似乎也没什么办法。\n既然公司业务上没办法，就做点力所能及的事吧。无意间在工作群里发现了疫况小程序，可以通过地图定位周边疫情风险，我仔细研究发现是之前认识的开发者做的，聊天一问才知道，他也正在发愁中，数据录入、服务器压力，马上就撑不住了。于是我立刻动员了产品开发团队，参与到这个小程序的支持中，重构界面、扩容服务器、招募数据志愿者、紧急制作疫情科普防护内容，每天熬十几个小时，连续一周，竟然把这个小服务提供给三千万人。\n这段时间的无偿投入，虽然没有多少商业收益，却让更多人知道了少数派的存在，展现了团队的价值观，也间接验证了优质内容的多重价值。\n经过这些事情之后，我个人的抗焦虑能力算是大幅提升，并且也建立了应对原则。人非圣贤，孰能无虑，适当的放低预期，知足常乐。另一方面，既然焦虑不可避免，就不要轻易放弃思考和行动。要知道宏观环境下，很多问题都是阶段性和周期性的，它总会过去或者从头再来，但你的人生经历只有一次，你的行动将决定自己未来的走向。不管有多焦虑，都应该先选择承担起当下的责任，因为转机就发生在这个过程之中。\n换个角度来看，这世界上还有很多人，正在面对着各种生存、病痛、离别、各种不可逆转的人生变故，他们可能都还没有焦虑的机会，相对来说，我们依然属于幸运的多数派了。",

They just look at their overall bill without considering how the energy was used. By monitoring and measuring energy use through sensors in very specific locations, energy waste can be made transparent and reduced.\nThat's the premise of the book Reinventing Fire: Bold Business Solutions for the New Energy Era, which offers methods to eliminate the use of fossil fuels by 2050 through energy waste reduction.

So it’s Really Dark Gray Black per the Material Design recommendations: https://material.io/design/color... \n\nThat turns out to have complications with things like bullet points, dividing lines, and formatting in general, so many thanks to @jacktilly who 💪 wrestled with the mighty Google Docs API to make the transition between 🌞 Light Mode and 🌚 Dark Mode painless.\n\nWe also wanted to prove that we can produce these transitions seamlessly and programmatically.  That will enable future cool stuff from Leet. 🎆\n\nCan you actually use your Dark Mode resume in job applications? \n\nYes, I think you can, especially in technology-driven or creative fields.  The format is what hiring teams and recruiters expect - there’s nothing funny, strange, or jarring about the content presented - so the Dark Mode will likely attract attention for the right reasons 💸 - your forward-looking willingness to embrace change and the future.🧑‍🚀\n\nMarc Cenedella\nFounder & CEO\nLeet Resumes\n\n🚨 p.s.
