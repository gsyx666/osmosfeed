More often than not, you need to temporarily host these projects on a platform to test, showcase, or obtain feedback.\nThere are several hosting platforms. Each platform has its strengths and weaknesses. The choice of a hosting platform largely depends on the framework and whether the project you want to host is a back-end, front-end, or full-stack application. Similarly, choose a platform that offers a generous free plan when building a hobby project.\nThis article will explore the top five platforms with generous free hosting plans.

They said I've got 2 months to find a job, so they would give me 2 months salary all the way to the end of December, after which I am officially fired from this company.\nCool, at least they kicked me out with 2 months notice and 2 full salaries.\nI actively started looking for a job, KEEP IN MIND that the IT hiring situation globally is in a mess, ALSO it is November/December, the 2 WORST months to get hired, as people would be distracted by holidays and so on...\n1 week after that discussion with my boss, he told me that he found me a small project. Hooray, I'm not getting fired after all. No no, you are still getting fired, said the BOSS, but do this project until you leave, WE ARE COVERING IT AFTERALL...\nWHAT?? So you want me to shift my focus from finding a job and do your stupid project until I leave? \nListen, finding a job in our market today is very hard, especially for a backend developer. So I am learning couple (not one) of frontend frameworks and bunch of other HIPPPP technologies so I can FINALLY get hired. I do NOT afford to spend time doing a STUPID project for the company that fired me for not finding a PROJECT for me!!!\nWhat do you think??? What should I do? Should I bluntly tell them off?

          "description": "What is an API key?\n\n\nAPI keys are generally assigned to a specific user or application, and they are used to track and control how that user or application is using the API. For example, an API key might be used to track the number of requests made by a user or application, or to limit the amount of data that can be accessed by a user or application. API keys are typically generated by the API provider, and they are unique to each user or application.\nAPI keys are supposed to be secret, but they often end up getting exposed. There are a few different ways this can happen.\nAPI keys are used by developers to access APIs. An API key is a secret code that is passed in to an API request. This key allows the API provider to identify the caller and grant them access to the requested resources or endpoints.\nAPI keys are a convenient way to grant access to specific functionality in an application. However, because they provide access to sensitive data, it is important to keep them secure. There are a few ways to prevent API key leaks:\nUse a strong API key management system that can rotate keys and track usage.\n\n\nDo not store API keys in plain text. Use a secure storage system such as a key management system or a secrets management system.\n\n\nUse a tool like AWS CloudTrail to monitor API activity and look for suspicious activity.\n\n\nEducate employees about the importance of security and the risks of sharing API keys.\n\n\n\nBy following these simple tips, you can help keep your API keys safe and prevent leaks.\nIn conclusion, take a look at API key leaks in a lighthearted, witty manner! This will help you find API key leaks and avoid them in the future.\nStar our Github repo and join the discussion in our Discord channel to help us improve the BLST website!\nBLST!",

This is where everything begins, and it’s where you get the bulk of the data your application requires. You simply must have access to a good amount of data before you can start building any meaningful features for your users.\nSampledata API is a premium API used by developers to test their application, It is designed in such a way that it saves developer time and allows the implementation of multiple testing scenarios\nSample Data API is a database of real-world data for developers to use in their applications. It's a platform for entrepreneurs and developers to build apps quickly, share the code behind the app, and access more data than ever before.\nIf you are starting your first front-end project, we recommend sampling data from demo APIs. Sampledata API allows users to make direct calls to CrowdFlower Data Center directly.\nThe Sample Data API (SDAPI) is a RESTful web service that makes it easy to access the full list of available sample data.

          "description": "以下是你如何在 Debian、Ubuntu 和其他发行版中修复 “sudo command not found” 错误的方法。\n\r\n\r\n有时，当你第一次设置或安装 Linux 发行版 时，你在用 sudo 尝试一些命令时，会出现 “sudo command not found” 的错误。\n\r\nsudo 命令是 “superuser do” 的缩写，它是一个允许用户以管理员权限执行命令的程序。sudo 命令帮助你像管理员用户一样运行程序/命令。\n\r\n此外，用 sudo 运行命令的用户必须是 sudo 组的一部分。\n\r\n你看到这个错误的主要原因是该软件包本身没有安装。然而，大多数现代 Linux 发行版都默认提供了这个功能，但有些则没有。\n\r\n下面是解决这个问题需要遵循的步骤。\n\r\n故障排除 #1\n\r\n首先，安装 sudo 包来解决这个问题。打开一个终端，刷新你的系统，并运行以下命令来安装 sudo。\n\r\n对于 Ubuntu、Debian 和相关发行版：\n\r\nsu -apt updateapt install sudo\r\n\n\r\n对于 Arch Linux：\n\r\npacman -S sudo\r\n\n\r\n对于 Fedora、RHEL 等：\n\r\nsu -dnf updatednf install sudo\r\n\n\r\n上述安装完成后，你必须使用以下命令将用户添加到 sudo 组中。\n\r\nusermod -aG sudo <yourusername>\r\n\n\r\n然后从终端运行 visudo，并运行以下行。按 CTRL+O 和 CTRL+X 来保存和退出。\n\r\n\n\r\n退出并再次登录使变化生效。\n\r\n故障排除 #2\n\r\n在做了上述改变之后，如果你仍然收到错误信息，那么请按照以下步骤操作。\n\r\n确保你的 $PATH 变量包含 sudo 可执行文件的正确路径。如果 sudo 已经安装，但 $PATH 不正确，你也会得到这个错误。理想情况下，你的路径应该包含以下所有的路径。\n\r\necho $PATH\r\n\n\r\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin\r\n\n\r\n要改变路径变量，使用以下命令。例如，如果 /usr/bin 不存在，那么你可以通过以下方式添加它。\n\r\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin\r\n\n\r\n然后注销并登录查看效果。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n我希望这个指南能帮助你解决 Linux 发行版中的 sudo 错误。表面上的解决方案很简单，真的。\n\r\n如果有帮助，或者如果你有任何问题，请在下面留言。\n\r\n\r\n参考\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/sudo-command-not-found/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "虽然现在多屏用户逐渐变多，但仍是小众，Windows 也并没过对多屏使用进行太多的优化。所以只好自己动手，于是有了以下一些个人自用的优化设置。\n窗口出现位置优化\nWindows 系统仅对多屏用户提供了简单主显示器的设置，默认情况下所有新打开的窗口都只会出现在主显示器上，即使你在使用另一个的显示器。而「基于显示器连接记住窗口位置」只能记住上次关闭时所在的屏幕，实用性并不高。\n\n这时微软自家的 Power Toys 里的 FancyZones 就可以派上用场了，除了我们熟知的窗口布局设置外，它还可以调整窗口行为，在这里我们可以通过启用「将新创建的窗口移动到当前 活动的监视器（实验性）」来达到这一效果，美中不足的是动画不够优雅。\n\n窗口出现的问题解决了，但任务栏上默认是显示所有屏幕上的窗口，不能让我们快速区分哪些应用是在当前屏幕下的。\n\n为了解决该问题，如下图所示，Windows 提供了简陋的选项加让人摸不着头脑的翻译。设置后，每个屏幕下的任务栏就只显示当前屏幕下打开的窗口，更符合直觉，不过 Win + 数字 的快捷键就只能在主显示器上使用了。\n\n内容显示优化\n现在 Windows 下大部分的应用都适配高 DPI 的，少部分不支持的，也可以通过 Windows 自带的属性 - 兼容性选项来调整。\n\n上面的设置仅解决了单个应用在高分辨率屏幕下的问题，并不能解决应用在分辨率相差太大的显示器间移动时会出现界面变形问题。这时，如果你使用的 AMD 显卡，那你可以通过启用 AMD Radeon Software 里的「超虚拟分辨率」来让低分辨率屏切换到更高的逻辑分辨率，不仅缩小的多屏间的分辨率差距，还有抗锯齿的效果。由于个人没有使用 Nvidia 和 Intel 显卡，相关选项是否存在请自行到显卡设置里翻找。\n\n设置完成后到 Windows 设置调整下逻辑分辨率和缩放即可。\n\n除此之外，对于我们网上冲浪必备的浏览器，它的缩放是固定的，且只有一个设置选项。不知道有没有人跟我一样两个屏幕的缩放比例是不一样的，在两个屏幕间移动浏览器时，网页内容并不会根据 DPI 而变化，导致观感割裂。在这里我推荐一个 FireFox 浏览器插件：ffreszoom，它可以实时感知屏幕宽度的变化，当宽度超过指定值时，自动调整到指定缩放比例。设置前先通过这个网站查看自己的屏幕宽度：http://whatismyscreenresolution.net/，需要将 Firefox 浏览器移动到不同显示器上刷新。\n\n如图所示我的外屏宽度是 1728 px，笔记本内屏为 1024，所以我在两者之间随意取了一个值用于判断，若当前屏幕宽度超过 1600 px，就自动设置缩放为 1.5，也即 150%。若小于 1600 px，则使用浏览器设置里的值。两种缩放无缝切换，只会多了一个缩放的动画。由于本人没使用 Chromium 类浏览器，并没有对应的插件推荐，不过其用户这么多，应该会有类似的插件。\n\n利用「闲置的」触摸板\n不知有没有跟我一样喜欢使用笔记本键盘的，且平时一些简单的操作直接用触摸板直接操作。现在 Windows 11 已经支持自定义触摸板多指手势了，但其不能根据不同应用设置不同的手势，例如：A 软件可以用 Ctrl  + W 关闭，但 B 软件只能用 Alt + F4，同一个操作有不同的快捷键。\n\n这时就需要第三方软件了，这里我推荐 GestureSign，界面虽然是 Windows 10 风格，但不影响使用，毕竟设置完就不用再看了。它可以为不同应用的不同快捷键键设置相同的触控手势，手势类型也不再仅限于横平竖直，可以自由发挥。同时软件也内置了一些常用的命令供选择。\n\n上图是我的一些设置，双指一般使用系统默认就不添加上去了。其中个人最爱的是三指滑动切换标签，体验比鼠标点击更加符合人的直觉。对于频繁使用搜索启动器的我，把三指上滑指定为搜索启动器的快捷键，方便呼出。\n \n对了，设置前记得把系统自带的相关手势取消掉，不然会冲突。若你仍不习惯使用触摸板，该软件也支持鼠标手势，具体可以自行下载体验。\n结尾\n以上便是我在使用多屏时遇到的问题，及相关解决方法，希望对多屏用户有帮助。",

Chances are, whoever committed the bug didn't declare it in their Git commit message.

A longer answer touches on where C stands among programming languages in general and towards Rust in particular. C, C++, and Rust are systems languages, which give programmers access to machine-level data types and operations. Among these three systems languages, C remains the dominant one. The kernels of modern operating systems are written mainly in C, with assembly language accounting for the rest.

Google recently kicked off its Black Friday sales promotions on its store, and that set off a chain reaction of the same or better deals being offered all over. While some products on sale are mainstays that see frequent discounts (like the Nest Mini smart speaker for $19.99), there are also excellent deals on the latest flagship phones and accessories. For example, the Pixel 7 Pro is on sale for $749, and the new Pixel Watch is $50 off.\nThis may just be the tip of the iceberg of this season’s Black Friday sales, as there are all kinds of other early deals worth your attention.

You pay-as-you-go to generate images instead of bulk buying credits or paying for subscriptions.\n\nProblem:\nOpenAI, the creators of the Dalle-2 AI model, charge $15 for 115 generation credits. We didn’t want to pay that since we weren’t going to use all of it.\n\nSolution:\nWe made a website allowing users to pay-as-you-go. Payments are accepted in Bitcoin over the Lightning Network ⚡.\n\nThe lightning network was chosen since payments are instant and have zero fees and is what enables us to accept microtransactions.\n\nPlease give us any positive or negative feedback you have! This is our first launch and we would love to know exactly what you think.\n\n👇 Follow us on twitter\nmicropay_ai\ndillionverma\nhaseabamin\n\nCall us 👉 calendly.com/micropay\nJoin our telegram group 👉  t.me/+zGVesHQRbl04NTA5\nJoin our reddit community 👉 reddit.com/r/micropay\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
