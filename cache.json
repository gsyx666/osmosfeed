In Ruby, we use destructuring to conveniently extract multiple values from data stored in Arrays or Hashes. It provides a way for us to group or ungroup data and assign them to variables where needed. \nIn this article we’re going to discuss destructuring for assignments, arrays and keyword args. We’ll also touch on why you would utilize destructuring.\nThe most straightforward form of destructuring is through multiple assignments. This form of destructuring assigns the variables on the left to the values on the right in the order that they are provided. \nAs an example:\na, b, c = 1, 2, 3\n\na => 1 \nb => 2 \nc => 3 \n\nIn the above example the variables on the left are assigned to the values on the right…",

          "description": "Software development principles are a must-know for all software engineers that aim to achieve clean codes. Software evolves with time as new features are required, so it is necessary to build a maintainable, reliable and sustainable code.\nSOLID principles are five basic principles for object-oriented programming design. They are set of rules to follow when designing a class structured software. These principles puts maintainability and extensibility into consideration as software evolves.\nSOLID STANDS FOR :\nS — SINGLE-RESPONSILITY PRINCIPLE\nO — OPEN-CLOSED PRINCIPLE\nL — LISTOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE\nI — INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE\nD — DEPENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE\nThe SOLID principles were first introduced by the famous Computer Scientist Robert J.

          "description": "THE BEST TWO WAYS TO SECURED YOUR WEB APP:\nValidate User Inputs:\nAccordingly, Injection-based attacks can come in so many ways; XSS, SQL injections, host header injection, and OS command injection are a few examples of these attacks.\nTherefore, Injection-based attacks have over the years made their way into the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) and SANS Top 25 CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) many times.\nSo, in the web development, we need to validate all inputs before the application processes the data to mitigate injection-based attacks.\nE.g., the phone number field, Password field, Name field, they must only accept an acceptable format with specific numeric and special characters.\nManaging Application Secrets:\nfor example, You can use environment variables within the operating system to store this sensitive information, and we can use Node.js to call these environment variables.\nHowever, there are instances where the application would require more than one variable instantiated. At this juncture, the only best way to manage secrets is to use the dotenv package.\nso, you can easily install it using npm or Yarn as follows:\nnpm install dotenv\nyarn add dotenv\nThen, create a .env file at the project root and define all the secrets in that file.\nNODE_ENV= develpment,\nMONGODB_URL = \"mongodb_url:uerbsf@kgeyfdop_jhf\"\nPORT = 3000\nUSERNAME=secret123\nPASSWORD=secret123@\n\nFinally, you can require and use these secrets in the application like below:\nrequire('dotenv').config();\n\nmongoose.connect({\nhost: process.env.PORT,\nusername: process.env.MONGODB_URL,\npassword: process.env.PASSWORD\n})\n\nMost importantly, make sure to include .env files in the .gitignore file to prevent them from being pushed to the Git repository.",

          "description": "深度发布独立软件包格式：玲珑\n\r\n深度操作系统预计在本月发布新的 Deepin 23 操作系统，其中将采用一种新的独立软件包格式：玲珑。 深度社区称玲珑是“统信软件自研的开源软件包格式，用于与 dpkg、rpm 等包管理系统共同实现应用包管理、分发、沙箱、集成开发工具等功能。”根据披露的特性，玲珑软件包可运行在任意 Linux 桌面环境中，运行在独立的沙箱环境，支持应用增量更新。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：深度\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看来是一种容器式软件包。确实，要打造一个“根操作系统”，是应该有个独立的软件包体系才名正言顺，但是应该有真正的软件包方面的创新才有意义。据我所知，这是国内这批“根操作系统”中第一个提出自己的软件包格式的操作系统。让我们拭目以待这个玲珑之后的进一步信息。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n英特尔将在 2024 年推出 Wi-Fi 7\n\r\n因为苹果正在将其设备过渡到 Wi-Fi 6E，英特尔正计划在 2024 年之前在设备中安装其下一代 Wi-Fi 7（802.11be）技术。Wi-Fi 7 是 Wi-Fi 6E（802.11ax）的继任者，带来了两倍于 5.8Gbps 的数据处理速度和更稳定的 6GHz 带宽稳定性，在处理数据时支持高达 36Gbps 带宽。苹果还没有发布任何支持 Wi-Fi 6E 的设备，有望在今年从 iPhone 14 开始支持。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：MacRumors\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：前两天刚刚换了一个 Wi-Fi 路由器，支持 Wi-Fi 6，我才用上，而这都要 Wi-Fi 7 了。不知不觉中无线网络技术居然已经进步这么快了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n教科书出版商希望借助区块链来在电子书转售时挣钱\n\r\n世界上最大的教科书出版商之一培生公司的 CEO 说，他希望像 NFT 和区块链这样的技术可以帮助该公司从电子书的二手销售中分得一杯羹，因为越来越多的书籍以电子书形式销售。纸质书籍，尤其是昂贵的教科书，有时候会转售七次之多，但转售不会出版商带来任何收益。而随着教科书转向数字化，教科书出版商看到了从转售中获利的可能。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：彭博社\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：纸质书转售对出版商没好处是因为出版商第一次就收到了足够的钱。而电子书却给出版商带来机会，让出版商有望控制电子书的二次流通，并通过它再次获利。",

          "description": "「记录」这件事就是非常有威力，它会把注意力之外的小细节收集起来，给予一种确实发生但又意料之外的生活视角。比如如果不是记账，我不知道原来每个月会支出那么多零零碎碎的「拿铁因子」；如果不是 HiWater，我也不会知道原来自己摄入那么多含糖饮料。\n其实我很早之前就购买过 WaterMinder 这款 App Store Editors's Choice 应用，只是彼时的我并不明白「多喝水」三个字对身体的意义，同时也觉得记录喝水这件事就像是记账——没有外部约束、「记录多少全凭诚实美德」的记录只在于自我娱乐。所以往往三天后意兴阑珊删除了事。\nHiWater 则是好友 @特伦 推荐的，把玩了下觉得还不错，但当时并不想为这个需求掏钱；不久前确诊痛风后，离开诊室满心灰暗的我有了「每天喝水 3L+」的刚需，这才发现这款应用的每一个付费点都值得我掏钱。\n作为一款国产应用，HiWater 的饮品目录预设种类都比较契合日常，并且在目录处还醒目地标注了每 100 毫升所带有的千卡热量。向下翻阅到高热量饮品时甚至有一种黑名单的既视感。\n\n如此设计的部分原因是，HiWater 采用了「饮水金字塔」模型，它将所有饮品归在六个等级内，并依此建议每日摄入的比例。此模型虽有哈佛大学公共卫生学院专家的背书，总体指导思想依然是鼓励大家多喝白水，减少摄入高糖、甚至是含糖饮料。\n关联阅读：如何合理控制糖分摄入\n\n对喝水提醒应用来说，我们一般会面临预设饮品难以覆盖真实世界情况的问题。\n所以在 HiWater 中我们也可以新增或编辑饮品类目到「饮水金字塔」模型中，把某个模糊的品类变成精确的单品。比如说 HiWater 预设了椰子水这个饮品，但我日常喝得比较多的是山姆椰子水，那我就直接编辑成山姆椰子水的营养成分，并重新归类到低卡饮料分类中去；再比如我喝的柠檬水是浓缩液和水 1:10 冲兑而来，因此我也通过计算将预设的「柠檬水」编辑成「自制柠檬水」，并由浓缩液计算出对应的热量。\n当然，手动编辑多了我们自然就会想：这些外包装上带有营养成分表的商品饮料，如何快捷记录到应用内？\nHiWater 的答案是「直接用相机扫」，请直接看这个动图：\n\n我猜测可能 Apple 在系统中给了 OCR 相关的 API，开发者就取来做这个功能了。这是我最喜欢的功能，实际使用起来识别比动图中要更迅速，识别率高且稳定。偶尔可能会有一些识别错误，比如把 ≥ 识别成 2，但我也能原谅。\n如此一来，在机场购买的农夫山泉力量帝柠檬水、屯了两箱的兰芳园低糖冻柠茶，都可以统统扫入我的饮品目录。记录时也可以根据自己的实际情况调整，比如冻柠茶虽是低糖，我还是会将它兑冰水或柠檬水喝，因此我的喝水记录里经常会出现 50 毫升的冻柠茶、紧接着出现 200 毫升的水或柠檬水。\n\n之前做手冲咖啡用的秤，现在大多被我用于称水喝，但后续我发现只要记住水倒在杯子上的花纹位置，不用秤也能大致知道这杯水的量。以名创优品的 580 毫升容积的可乐杯为例，杯内两道凹痕，分别可以粗略看作是 200/500 毫升的刻度。在公司喝水，可以考虑在工位启用大杯子装水，之前因为杯子小+次数少，上班时喝水太少。一周下来，确实每日喝水 3.3L 以上。\n\n其余的基础功能，诸如弹出提醒用户喝水、身体水分的简单预估、根据用户情况估算需要摄入的水量等，我就不一一展开了，WaterMinder 也有，我认为这些是一款「喝水类」App 都应该做的免费功能。其实我原先也是想通过快捷指令自己做一个提醒和记录每日喝水的应用，这不难，我甚至已经做好了 社死版快捷指令 定时运行，但体验过 HiWater 的一些交互后，我最后决定不折腾自己了。\n应用内还有不少花心思的交互和设计\nHiWater 多样的桌面小组件，还支出快捷录入饮品，打破了我对 iOS 小组件「能看不能用」的固有认知（我原先在 iOS 上并不使用任何 Widget，这一下就微上瘾了，顺带一口气添加了其余应用的小组件 xD）。\n精美的 Widget，支持快捷录入\nHiWater 采用免费下载+内购解锁的付费机制，如果你看完文章对它感兴趣，安装来把玩把玩也可以。如果想要为它付费的话，建议先确认自己有强烈的督促自己喝水的需求，然后订阅一个月试试——我直接买断是因为意识到「多喝水」这样的生活我可能要持续好几个月，甚至好几年，本身并不是很理性的消费习惯。\n如果一个应用能够帮助我长期维持某个健康习惯，我愿意给出「十刀买断，天大划算」的评价；如果没有，我也会用「三分钟热度三分钟收获」来安慰自己。\n> 下载 少数派 2.0 客户端、关注 少数派公众号，解锁全新阅读体验 📰\n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀",

          "description": "家庭治疗兴起于二十世纪中期，属于团体治疗（group therpay）的一部分。他们一致反对主流的声音，即认为心理症状只来自于个体本身，提出心理问题其实是来自个体与他人相处方式受到干扰所带来的副产品。\n家庭治疗认为，心理症状是个体所处的家庭由于功能失调所带来的副产品。\n家庭治疗师从哲学和科学当中借鉴了一个理论：系统方法（system approach），即整体大于部分之和。换句话说，其实是从个人治疗的思想中切换到以家庭为单位（faimly-unit）治疗思想。治疗师关注的是整个家庭状况，而不是单独针对个人，将责任归咎于家庭中的某个人，或者指责某个人。所以，家庭治疗中，最基本的东西。过程中，家庭成员与治疗师一起努力，改善成员之间的互动，从而加强每个成员的心理健康。\n系统理论\n系统方法的核心是循环因果关系（Circular causality）比线性因果关系（Linear causality）更能解释心理问题。\n\n线性因果关系（Linear Casuality）：A 影响 B；但 B 不影响 A。意思是，父母对待孩子的方式影响孩子的后续行为，但孩子的后续行为并不会反过来影响父母。\n循环因果关系（Circular Casuality）：A 与 B 互相影响。意思是，父母对待孩的方式影响孩子的后续行为，而此种后续行为也同样影响着父母。\n\n家庭中，普遍存在的问题是不健康的沟通模式。在家庭治疗的早期，很多理论家将它与病理结果结合在一起，诞生了最为著名和有趣的两个例子。第一个例子是「精神分裂症母亲」（Fromm-Reichamnn, 1948）。这个理论认为，专制且冷酷的母亲与无能、弱势的父亲结合在一起，会导致孩子精神分裂。第二个理论是双重束缚理论（Bateson, Jackson, Haley, & Weakland, 1956)。这个理论认为，父母一直给孩子不可避免的混合命令，也会导…",

Well, what good is the toolchain if you won’t be using it to get more hands-on with Rust? Learning any language involves reading existing code and writing a lot of sample programs. That's a good way to become proficient in a language. However, there's a third way: debugging code.\nLearning through debugging involves trying to compile a pre-written (buggy) sample program, understanding the errors generated by the compiler, fixing the sample code, and then re-compiling it. Repeat that process until the code successfully compiles and runs.\nRustlings is an open source project by the Rust team that h…",
