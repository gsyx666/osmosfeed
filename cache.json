For a while I have been working on the useful project, in my opinion, and thrilled to share with you. \nI began to think what more complicated I can do. I got to know the Dev community a while ago and found it very interesting and promising. What a surprise it was that it didn't have a mobile app, not even a community app. Somehow that's how I came up with the idea of creating an open source Dev app. I'm looking forward to any suggestions, whether it's development help, design, or new features.\nLet's talk about the features you can see in the app for now. In the process of development there were a lot of ideas that I really hope to implement. Some, of course, are limited by the capabilities of the API.  I'll make a roadmap a bit later.\nBy default you can read popular articles and the newest ones at once (the output may be a little weird, you may give out articles in different order, not update articles for a long time, but that's all because of the API's peculiarities). Right on the home page you can add the tags you are interested in and read the current articles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now tag can be selected in Preferences -> Tags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can go to authors' profiles and view information about them, links to resources, and a list of articles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp lives in light mode and dark mode, of course. Just one of the future features is the ability not only to change the accent color, but also to completely change the appearance of the application, adjusting to a comfortable and favorite format for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe in power of community and that we can build an interesting app 😊\nhttps://github.com/ytskk/deco\nFor now its just a link to apk file.\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1TJTZZ8G1YGmBEzwsEPS2sklrcvBb7lu6/view?usp=sharing",

Additionally, when you care about minification of your code, you end up using 2 characters (2 tildes) instead of 12. (from JS bitwise operators in practice)\nShould we really use ~~(a/b) to avoid writing Math.floor(a/b)? Are you kidding me?\nHonestly, when used in a normal application, in simple methods that are not running thousands of operation per second, it just hides the intention and hinders readability. \nconst mergedOptions = {...optionsDefault, ...options};\n\nconst mergedOptions  = Object.assign({}, optionsDefault, options);\n\nand you might be true. But sorry, no, it is not the same thing.\n\nThese micro-optimisation using bitwise operator, are most of the time unnecessary tricks to look smarter during code reviews.\n\nJust imagine this hypothetical conversation:\nOh, you really didn't know the double tilde?   C'mon! it's a bitwise operation ( pronounced with low mysterious emphatic tone - welcome to the cult!) and it's sooo much faster than Math.floor.\nI am not saying it is not useful.  it definitely is, under some circumstances. \n\nOtherwise, keep it simple and favour readability.\nsome other useful resources about the topic:\nThe Mysterious Double Tilde (~~) Operation\n\n\nJavaScript's Tilde: Its Real Use Is No Mystery",

          "description": "你可以通过以下方式确定你的 Linux 发行版中是否正在运行 systemd 或其它初始化系统。\n\r\n\r\n首个进程在你启动 Linux 发行版时开始运行，它称为初始化进程 init（初始化initialization的缩写）。它的进程标识符为 1（即 pid=1）。基于 Unix 的系统中的所有进程和应用程序都是这个初始化进程的后代。\n\r\n根据功能和特性，存在不同类型的初始化进程。例如，systemd、Runit、OpenRC、sysVinit 等。其中，systemd 是最流行和最现代的一种，被包括 Ubuntu 和 Fedora 在内的所有现代 Linux 发行版使用和采用。\n\r\n与传统的基于 Unix 的初始化系统相比，systemd 及其性能一直存在争议。但这就是另外一个话题了。\n\r\n让我们看看如何确定在 Linux 发行版中运行的是 systemd 还是其它初始化系统。\n\r\nsystemd 还是其它初始化系统？\n\r\n不幸的是，没有直接的命令可以找到它。你可以从初始化进程追溯它，它基本上是到 /sbin/init 的符号链接，即 pid=1。\n\r\n使用 strings 命令打印嵌入在二进制文件 /sbin/init 中的文本并使用以下命令搜索 init：\n\r\nstrings /sbin/init | grep init\r\n\n\r\n示例 1\n\r\n在下面的输出中，它是一个运行 Debian（Peppermint OS）的 sysVinit 系统。如你所见，它清楚地显示了 init 进程名称。\n\r\nstrings /sbin/init | grep init\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n如果在上述同一个系统中找 systemd，那么不会有任何结果。因此，你可以得出结论，你正在运行 sysVinit 而不是 systemd。\n\r\n示例 2\n\r\n如果你在 systemd 系统中运行上述命令，你可以在输出的第一行轻松看到 systemd 及其版本。\n\r\nstrings /sbin/init | grep systemd\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n示例 3\n\r\n你也可以尝试使用 pstree 命令打印进程树，它应该会显示第一个进程名称。它应该是 systemd 或 init，如下例所示。\n\r\npstree\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n这就好了。这样你就可以轻松找出你的发行版是使用 systemd 还是其他的。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/systemd-or-init/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "以下是如何在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版中提高笔记本和桌面的音量的方法。\n\r\n\r\n你有没有觉得你的 Ubuntu 笔记本的音量太小，尽管你把音量调到了 100%？我相信你有过。主要原因是：很明显，笔记本电脑的扬声器输出强度比大型扬声器要低。\n\r\n此外，Ubuntu 和其他发行版将默认的最大音量设置为 100%，也就是 0dB（分贝）。0dB 是最大音量的参考值。做个比较，如果你把音量设置为 -10dB，这意味着你的音量比最大的 0dB 安静。\n\r\nVLC 和一些媒体播放器允许你将音量提高到 200%。在最新的 Ubuntu 中使用一些设置，你可以将音量进一步提高。\n\r\n\r\n注意：在你尝试和使用以下方法之前，请记住，每个扬声器都有其制造商设定的硬件限制。偶尔一次，播放超过 100% 的音频是可以的。但是，连续放大到更高的分贝可能会使输出的音频失真，并且从长远来看可能会损坏你的扬声器。因此，在使用时要小心谨慎，并有所限制。\n\r\n\r\n在 Ubuntu 和其他发行版中提高扬声器音量\n\r\n对于最新的 Ubuntu 22.04 及以上版本（GNOME）\n\r\n从应用菜单中打开“设置Settings”，进入“声音Sound”标签。\n\r\n启用 “过度放大Over Amplification” 开关。在你启用的那一刻，你应该看到音量条被扩大了。\n\r\n\n\r\n现在你可以享受音量提升来听音乐了。\n\r\nFedora、Arch Linux 和其他发行版\n\r\n如果你使用带有 GNOME 的 Fedora 工作站，你将看不到上述选项，因为这是 Ubuntu 特有的设置。见下面。\n\r\n\n\r\n因此，对于任何其他 Linux 发行版（Arch、Fedora、RedHat 等）或桌面（KDE、Xfce、LXQt 等），打开终端并安装 PulseAudio 音量控制器。\n\r\nFedora、RedHat Linux、OpenSUSE 等基于 RPM 的发行版：\n\r\nsudo dnf install pavucontrol\r\n\n\r\n对于 Arch Linux、Manjaro：\n\r\nsudo pacman -S pavucontrol\r\n\n\r\n基于 Ubuntu 的非 GNOME 发行版：\n\r\nsudo apt install pavucontrol\r\n\n\r\n如何使用\n\r\n安装后，从应用菜单中打开 pavucontrol，它应该有个 &ldquoulseAudio Volume Control” 菜单项。\n\r\n\n\r\n总结\n\r\n记住，上述方法可以提高整个系统的扬声器音量。这意味着系统的声音和警报也会受到影响。所以，要记住这一点。正如我前面提到的，如果连续使用，提升扬声器音量超过 100% 可能会导致扬声器变形或损坏。\n\r\n我希望这个教程能帮助你提高系统音量。如果你遇到问题，请在评论栏里告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/boost-speaker-volume-ubuntu/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "作为一名iPhone用户，快捷指令是系统中我觉得很有趣但实际上用得不是很多的应用。\n最初对快捷指令的理解仅限于将多个操作步骤简化成一个，最直观的应用就是在功能日益繁杂的APP中实现功能的一键直达，比如疫情期间的健康码。\n但深入探究一番后，我认为快捷指令的本质其实是打破各个APP沙盒的壁垒，实现不同应用程序的能力互通，提升个人的自动化水平。\n但事情情况并不尽如人意，虽然快捷指令编辑器提供了足够强大的编辑器，但三方应用对其支持并不好，大多数APP还是尽可能期望把用户圈在自己的生态中，没有开放足够的能力出来，这也是一款生态级应用的无奈。\n想象中的快捷指令\n现在应用商店的APP已经足够多，可以帮助人们解决足够多的问题，但有时候一款应用并不能完全解决某项任务，需要多个应用配合操作，如果用户可以随意调用应用中功能并组合成自己所需要完成特定任务的能力，那么用户体验和效率都将提升到新的高度。\n想象一种场景，当我在观看自己感兴趣的外语视频时，因为语言的障碍可能不能足够理解视频内容，我需要一些辅助支持：我希望翻译软件能够帮我把外语翻译成母语，甚至希望语音合成软件将翻译后的语言读出来。孤立地看这个场景中的每个需求，都有应用能很好得实现：视频网站能够提供我感兴趣的内容，翻译软件能将语言进行较高准确度的翻译，语音合成软件能够将文字朗读出来。但是当这三个需求点分布在三个不同的APP时，用户就难以较高效率完成这个场景的任务。实际上每个APP的能力都被封锁在了自己APP里面。\n\n上面说的这个场景我自己就有，但是因为没能使用现有工具很好使用，只得自己动手做了一个插件，可以朗读B站上面带有字幕的视频，因为微软的中文语音合成做得比较好，所以先放在Edge浏览器上了，目前还只支持带外挂字幕的视频，大家感兴趣也可以使用。\n\nB站视频字幕朗读（中文同传）插件地址-> Microsoft Edge Addons\n现实中的快捷指令\n虽然当前快捷指令还不够优秀，但对于日常效率的提升还是有一定帮助的，特别是对于实现与苹果自带应用的互通。\n举个使用的例子，每天早上我会用笔记软件记录一下昨日回顾、思考以及今日的计划，对于今日计划，我希望用待办应用去跟踪计划中事项的状态，但是手动把写过的东西在另一个APP里面再写一遍实在是太过愚蠢，于是我就写了快捷指令去实现。\n\n实际使用中，只要选择对应的文本并在共享表单中点击对应的操作就可以同步到系统自带的提醒事项中，在mac上还可以添加快捷键一键实现（应该还可以通过「自动化」省去手动操作这一步）。\n当前的快捷指令有三个亮点：\n\n在快捷指令的编辑上采用图形化拖拽操作，相对于写脚本，这种操作显得更加友好，并且也可以支持自定义脚本的加入，甚至让我一度觉得学编程的第一个应用是用快捷指令写得；\n在快捷指令的运行上打通了Siri、小组件以及共享操作，特别是后者，为与三方应用的结合提供了基础的平台；\n加入了自动化功能，可以根据一定的规则直接省去了用户主动调用快捷指令这一步。\n\n但要让更多的人在更多场景下使用快捷指令，还有着一些明显的不足：\n\n上手使用上有一些门槛，官方没有详细的教程，虽然提供了一些案例，但是大多数人应该没有耐心仔细去看快捷中心中那些精选的指令是如何实现的，这点Mac上快捷指令前辈「自动操作」可能给点其启示，其中「录制」功能可以通过「我做给你看」自动识别操作中的事件；\n快捷指令的分发做得还不够，既然不是每个人都能轻松使用快捷指令，那么获取现成的快捷指令则更加重要，但快捷指令中心中精选的指令本土化、个性化做得并不好，我觉得如果能根据用户所安装的APP来个性化分发常用的快捷指令会更友好；\n三方应用的能力开放明显不足，大多数的使用场景还是围绕在苹果自带应用提供的能力，这点极大限制了快捷指令的应用场景；\n使用Siri来激活快捷指令时对于指令的识别非常差，官方有说使用快捷指令的名称就可以通过Siri调用，但实际使用时不时语音识别不出来就是调用的指令不正确；\n\n有趣的是，在WWDC2022中，我们看到苹果开始推广App Intent框架，通过为应用开发者提供更多系统级的入口曝光来吸引他们将其应用所能满足的用户意图曝光给系统，从而使得系统可以通过学习用户行为实现跨应用的能力整合。\n结语\n很多人即使生活中充满重复的事情也不会去探索提高效率方式，因为对比眼前简单的操作，去探究增进效率操作的所花费的学习努力带来的成本更加高，只是把时间线拉得足够远，才能看见效率提升所带来收益。\n自动化所存在的意义是帮助人完成任务并节省时间，虽然我们每个人都已经拥有足够多的计算设备，但我们并没有充分发挥其拥有的算力，个人的自动化仍是一个尚待开发的领域。\n期待未来的快捷指令能为个人的自动化增添更多的可能性。",

In this article, I cover some of the ways you can customize how your system puts zram to use.\nAugmented swap\nZram swap can be augmented with standard secondary storage devices. Adding some traditional swap space can be especially useful on systems with low amounts of RAM.

I was looking for a talented web designer, and had to wade through hundreds of mediocre profiles before discovering Aaron. Likewise, Aaron had to sit around and wait to be discovered, buried deep on a number of oversaturated platforms.\n\nWe knew there had to be a better way—an antidote to Dribbble, Behance, Working Not Working, and ILoveCreatives. A platform that guaranteed that every creative was amazing, so that finding and hiring could be done in minutes, not days.\n\nOur deep network of creatives has been built over two decades in the industry. We’ve hand-picked and personally invited only 100 of the best of them across Branding, Photography, Web Design, Product Design, Illustration, Motion, 3D, and Copywriting. Each profile page shows off both personality and portfolio, helping you get to know a creative's work and process, so you can hire them quickly with confidence.\n\nLooking for a \"Web Designer who specializes in Webflow, has a minimalist (but colorful) style, with experience in crypto, and starts at $10k?\" No problem. Quickly find a perfect match, with the assurance that they’re experienced, reputable businesspeople.\n\nExplore the directory today, completely free.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
