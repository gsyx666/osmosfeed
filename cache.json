Moreover there are many senior developers in the community so if you are looking for a referral you can request for the same as well. You can Join the Community on Slack and Discord.\nData Structure and Algorithm are very crucial for getting selected in product based companies like MANG(Meta, Amazon, Netflix & Google). So these are some Mistakes you need to avoid while preparing for the same :- \n1- Do not Focus on Doing Maximum Question :- We generally focus on number of questions like solving 20 questions in a day and aim to do 1000 questions . This is completely a wrong approach as because of this we don't get the benefits of focusing on a question and solving it properly, so when you work like this your foundation isn't strong which is very important in an interview. So instead of targeting 1000 questions, do 400- 500 questions and take your time and build a strong foundation.\n2- Solve a Problem on Pen and Paper :-  Generally many of us avoid writing on pen and paper and directly jump on to the question and start coding but before starting to code always ensure that you are writing a pseudo code or a flow chart in your notebook as it gives you an step by step approach.\n3- Consistency :- This is the most Important point you need to be consistent, being consistent is hard but when you are preparing DSA consistency plays a very important role. It is not important that you have to solve 10 questions in a day , just start by solving 5 questions in a day and be consistent in it and by the end of just 3 month you will be able to solve 450 questions.",

We first need to define an EventListener that calls a toggleVideoPlayback function when the Page Visibility visibilitychange event has been fired:\ndocument.addEventListener(\"visibilitychange\", toggleVideoPlayback);\n\nNow let’s create the toggleVideoPlayback function:\nconst toggleVideoPlayback = () => {\n  const video = document.getElementById(\"video\");        \n  return document.hidden ? video.pause() : video.play();           \n};\n\nThis function checks the status of document.hidden. If this equals true the video will pause and if it equals false the video will resume playing. You can go ahead and test this code in browser now, note the timestamp when you navigate to another tab whilst the video is playing to confirm the video has been paused when you return.\nThat’s all for this tutorial. You should now have an understanding of how the Page Visibility API works. If you’re interested in learning about some of the other uses for the Page Visibility API the MDN Web Docs is worth checking out.",

It is quickly possible to find out why something doesn't work and it is convenient to use visual tools to fix the problem but you still need to remember what you changed and repeat those changes in your editor. \nOne of the engineers on our team showed me an idea he had. As both the browser and the editor (in this case Visual Studio Code) are based on the same platform (Chromium), it would be possible to integrate the convenient debugging experience of the browser developer tools right into the editor and not only change what is shown in the browser but also the source code that generates it.\nI immediately latched onto …",

          "description": "得益于开发者们最近的贡献，在 Ubuntu 中使用自己的强调色是很简单的。\n\r\n\r\n每个 Linux 发行版都有它们默认的主题，具有各自的主色调。强调色用于在各个设置中突出主色调。通常，主色调和强调色应该形成对比和补充。\n\r\n在最近的 GNOME 桌面的更新之后，Ubuntu 桌面在 22.04 LTS 版本中引入了强调色。\n\r\n尽管如何应用它们是显而易见的，但是为了 Linux 的新手，我将解释如何在 Ubuntu 桌面中使用强调色。\n\r\n在 Ubuntu 桌面中应用强调色\n\r\n\r\n从应用菜单中打开 系统设置System Settings\n\r\n进入 外观Appearance 菜单\n\r\n在 风格Style 菜单下，你应该见到一套预设的颜色。\n\r\n选择其中的一个来改变强调色。\n\r\n\r\n一旦更改，强调色将被应用到 GTK 应用程序中的选区和 GTK 控件中，如切换按钮和文件夹的默认外观。\n\r\n默认的强调色是橙色，有十种颜色可供选择，具体如下：\n\r\n\r\n橙色\n\r\n树皮色\n\r\n鼠尾草色\n\r\n橄榄绿\n\r\n铬绿\n\r\n普鲁士绿\n\r\n蓝色\n\r\n紫色\n\r\n品红色\n\r\n红色\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n（LCTT 译注：树皮色是一种棕色，鼠尾草色是一种灰绿色。）\n\r\n你应该记住一点，深色和浅色的主题的强调色组合可能改变你的桌面的整体外观。\n\r\n以上的特性只是只适用于目前使用 GNOME 桌面的 Ubuntu，而不适用于其它提供原生 GNOME 的发行版，例如 Fedora Workstation。因为有一些内容是由 Ubuntu 团队开发的，并且并没有合并到 GNOME 上游。\n\r\nKubuntu 中的强调色\n\r\n使用带有 KDE Plasma 桌面的 Kubuntu，你可以简单地使用强调色。KDE Plasma 提供了预设的颜色，也有自定义的颜色选择器选项。另外，自 KDE Plasma 5.25 起，强调色可以根据壁纸来改变。\n\r\n为了在 Kubuntu 中改变它，跟着下面的步骤走：\n\r\n\r\n在应用菜单中打开 系统设置System Settings\n\r\n进入 外观Appearance > 全局主题Global Theme > 颜色Colours 标签\n\r\n选择你的强调色\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n我知道 Lubuntu 与 Xubuntu 并没有这个特性。而且它不太可能很快到来。\n\r\n使用愉快。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/ubuntu-accent-colour/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：yjacks 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "起因：加班太多，病倒了\n之前公司赶项目进度，我所在的团队两个月无休连轴转，导致身体负荷太大，生了一场小病。医生的诊断是免疫系统出了问题，虽然对日常生活影响不大，但可能无法根治，只能慢慢调理。从诊室走出来后，我立即将「保持身体健康」这件事的优先级「置顶」了，决定开始改变以前一些不健康的生活习惯。\n除了调整作息、加强锻炼，也开始研究日常的营养摄入。但是关于营养，我除了知道几个类似「高油、高糖、高盐要少吃」、「卡路里超标会肥胖」、「高蛋白可以增肌」的碎片化概念，似乎也没有更加深入的认知了，一时有点无从下手。\n于是我决定先从书里找找答案。\n灵感：从食物多样性入手\n在豆瓣的书单和评分榜上一番搜寻，我注意到了《你是你吃出来的》这本书。看完之后，书里提到的一个概念让我印象深刻：人类是杂食动物，吃得不够全面，是营养失衡最常见的诱因。\n1.身体器官出毛病，主要是因为细胞损伤得快，修复得慢。\n人体内的细胞都是在以固定的速度更新换代，比如血管的内皮细胞 1 天就会死亡；胃黏膜细胞 3 ～ 5 天更替一次；肺表面的细胞寿命是 2 ～ 3 周。当细胞修复的速度高于损伤速度，就是健康的，「青黄不接」则容易出毛病。\n2.上述过程所需的「原材料」，唯一来源就是日常摄入的食物。\n虽然生病后吃药可以抑制、缓解症状，但并没有根本上改变细胞更新的平衡。更合理的方式是通过日常饮食提供充分的「原材料」，让细胞更新的平衡有序地运转下去。\n3.人体所需的营养元素十分庞杂，很难靠少数几种食物就满足。\n比如上皮组织，如果人体内缺乏胶原蛋白，细胞之间的缝隙会加大，上皮细胞的保护功能就会减弱，管腔中的血液就会渗透出去，形成皮下出血。比如摄碘不足或者过量都将影响甲状腺功能，造成甲状腺的损伤。不同的身体器官，所需要的营养元素不尽相同，综合起来，身体所需的营养是个相当复杂的集合。如果日常只是摄入少数几种食物，就容易导致营养「偏科」，被忽视掉的营养元素可能导致某些器官的细胞更新的失衡。反之，吃得越杂，营养越容易均衡。\n《中国居民膳食指南 2022 》中也有类似的建议。《指南》共有8条核心准则，其中第一条就是「食物多样，合理搭配」，并明确建议「平均每天摄入12种以上食物，每周25种以上」。\n来源：《中国居民膳食指南》官网\n动手：「吃得杂」简单易行，但似乎没有趁手的工具\n作为一个打工人，我认为「吃得杂」的策略十分可行。一方面，我不仅仅满足于吃得饱、吃得爽，必须要提升下日常营养摄入的质量。另一方面，又也不想在营养搭配上花太多的精力，比如研究某些「神奇食物」、详细规划每一餐的卡路里、食物成分等等。「吃得杂」的策略就成了质量和效率的平衡之选。\n \n「每周25种」开始成为我的饮食准则。\n我开始有意每餐都吃一些不一样的食物，降低自己的营养「偏科」风险。 做起来似乎其实不难，菜市场买得到的，或者快餐能点的，随便组合下基本就能达到。 但这个策略执行了一段时间，我发现总是记不住这周吃了多少种。\n为了记录饮食，我也尝试了几个现有的应用，但要么功能太庞杂，各种 Banner 、营销推送满屏飞，要么记录成本太高，功能太偏向专业用户，比如要记录食物的重量、卡路里等等参数，而实际上我并不需要这么精确的食物成分管理。\n我既想知道自己有没有做到「食物多样」，又不想在这 [记录] 这个环节耗费太多的精力。既然工具不趁手，就自己做一个。\n「杂食记」——帮你达成「每周25种」的健康膳食目标\n \n量化当周的膳食目标达成进度，以及基本的种类分布。\n\n记录时只需要记下种类，不需要输入其他繁琐的参数。\n\n分析饮食数据，帮你更了解自己的饮食偏好，同时支持小组件。\n提供分析图表，并支持小组件\n可通过食物库管理食物，内置了常见的食物，当然你也可以自定义添加。\n\n按日期查询每一天的详细记录，当然也可以删除。\n\n其他小功能：定时提醒，帮你养成记录习惯；自定义每周膳食目标，给自己「加码」\n\n希望大家一起好好吃饭\n调理营养可能是个很复杂的事情，你我身上也背了很多责任和限制，没法做到永远把「营养调理」摆在第一优先级，但我们也许可以从好好吃饭开始，日常习惯做一点微小的改变，就能帮身体的营养维持该有的平衡。希望我的 App 可以帮大家迈出第一步，从「每周吃够25种」开始，变得更加健康。\n关于App的其他\n\n目前是买断制，另外App内有打赏页面，各位用得顺手可随缘投喂。\n发布才一个多月，功能和体验还在持续优化进步中。大家有任何建议或吐槽都可以通过站内信或者App内的邮件地址联系我。\nBug一定马上改，但功能不会随便加，尤其是与「每周25种」无关的功能会更加谨慎。同时，我觉得除了记录、查看分析之外并，大家没有必要在这个App中停留太久，希望做到「真·用完即走」、「真·小而美」。",

The router creates a local network, and you connect your devices to it, including your computer, mobile, TV, game console, and anything else that needs to connect to the Internet or to each other. It's deceptively easy to think of this setup as there being two \"sides\" of your router: On one side there's the Internet, and on the other, your devices.

From that moment on, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in computers. I haven't stopped hanging around them since. During high school, when considering which specific area I wanted to focus on, I started experimenting with hacking, and that was the moment I decided to pursue a career as a security engineer.\nI'm now a software engineer on the security compliance team. I've been at Red Hat for over two years, and I work remotely in the Czech Republic. I've used Linux for about 12 years, mainly Arch Linux and Fedora, but I've also administered Debian, Gentoo, and Ubuntu in the past.\n  \n\n\n      \n   \nImage by: \n(Vojt…",

I frequently write about using automation to make sysadmin tasks easier. I have also written in multiple places that I learn more from my own mistakes than I do in almost any other way.\nI have learned a lot during the last couple of weeks.\nI created a major problem for myself.

Today, it's easily possible for a single photo to be 5 MB. Accordingly, the maximum attachment size has increased to, say, 25 MB. But of course file sizes are getting bigger and bigger too, and so eventually the attachment limit will go up too. It's an endless cycle, common in the digital world: the tools are built for today's data, and today's data increases in complexity and size until the tools are revised and improved. You have to contain data, preferably in the smallest packaging possible, so that sharing it online goes faster for everyone. Here are five ways to optimize images for the Internet.\n…",

Once you have your collection's art created you can deploy a smart contract with an awesome mint button you can embed anywhere.\n\nWe always prop up tools that make Web3 more accessible and open.

Simply use the builder to generate desired template sections, input your own information, and play around with customization.\n\nPlaintext is only saved locally (to the browser), so it’s recommended to copy any text you’ve made and save it elsewhere once you’re done. When you want to pick it back up, you can simply paste and get to editing.\n\n💬 No sign-up & free! Get started in seconds.\n💸 ATS friendly. Bypass those corporate parsers and get an interview.\n🎨 Tons of customization. Choose the best from a handful of templates, fonts, and from one to two columns with a few clicks. There’s live preview!\n📄 Export to PDF. Export to the most widely used resume format to start finding your dream job.\n🌙 Dark mode... for when you’re jobhunting at night.\n\n From one job-hunter to another, hope you enjoy, and let me know what you think of my summer project! Thanks!\n\n- Tiffany\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "BrewMyMac! Possibly the coolest way to install apps and customize your Mac!\n\nWith BrewMyMac, you can choose from a wide range of apps and tweaks and install them with a single click. It is a much better way than going to each app's website separately and starting all the downloads manually.\n\nI am a software engineer and architect working for a consulting firm. Over the past seven years, I've used seven MacBooks - four provided by my companies and three by clients. Every time I received a new MacBook, I had to go through the painful process of installing more than 20 apps necessary for my work. I needed to search the Internet for tweaks on how to customize the look'n'feel of my Mac and change its default behaviors to suit my style. That was a tedious process. I often ended up spending 3 or 4 days on that, and I still missed installing some apps and tweaks.\n\nA couple of years ago, I made an Ansible Playbook automating all these. It was a success. It set up my Mac in minutes. But it is a tool for developers only and I wanted to share it with other power users. That's why I made BrewMyMac.\n\nBrewMyMac allows you to install over 10K apps from Homebrew and Homebrew Cask, and Mac apps from App Store. You can customize your Mac with the 49 tweaks provided. After you finish selecting which apps and tweaks to install, it generates a single-line command which you can copy-paste and run in Terminal. That command will handle the rest including the installation of Homebrew and Ansible.\n\nUnder the hood, BrewMyMac is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. It uses a free no-code service as its database. There is no backend code implementation, making it portable and free to use.\n\nBrewMyMac is an open-source project and is currently in the beta testing phase. I'm excited to hear any comments, questions or feedback.\n\nWebsite: https://brewmymac.sh\nGitHub: https://github.com/ayltai/BrewMyMac\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

Think of it like Cards Against Humanity but for climate change.   As you strategically deploy various climate solutions, you will be tested on your knowledge and ability to prioritize. In order to avoid the worst of the climate crisis, you will need to think critically about each solution and discuss with your teammates. The game was designed for gamers, non-gamers, and even those who have no particular interest in climate.\n\nSam and his team spent thousands of hours to build the game’s foundation on cutting-edge climate research. For example, the core solutions in the game are inspired by the work of Paul Hawken, the co-founder of Project Drawdown. Other research, such as the feedback loop cards and the starting points for global temp, are based on NASA, the IPCC, NOAA, Yale, Stanford, the World Resources Institute, and more.\n\nSam and team created Solutions to help you have fun while also having meaningful discussions about climate change. I'm hunting this because its a great game and you can learn a lot. Cheers!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
