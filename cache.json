          "description": "SQL JOIN is a type of clause that is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. The purpose of a JOIN clause is to retrieve data from multiple tables and combine it into a single result set that can be used in various operations, such as selecting, updating, or deleting data.\nThere are several types of JOIN clauses in SQL, each with its own specific purpose and syntax. The most commonly used JOIN clauses are INNER JOIN, OUTER JOIN, and CROSS JOIN.\nINNER JOIN is the most basic type of JOIN clause and is used to combine rows from two or more tables that have a matching column. For example, if we have a \"customers\" table and an \"orders\" table, we can use an INNER JOIN to combine the two tables on the \"customer_id\" column, which is shared by both tables. This will return only the rows from both tables where the \"customer_id\" value is the same.\nOUTER JOIN is a type of JOIN clause that is used to combine rows from two or more tables, even if they do not have a matching column. There are two types of OUTER JOIN: LEFT OUTER JOIN and RIGHT OUTER JOIN. LEFT OUTER JOIN combines rows from the left table with rows from the right table, and includes all rows from the left table, even if they do not have a matching row in the right table. RIGHT OUTER JOIN is the opposite, and includes all rows from the right table, even if they do not have a matching row in the left table.\nCROSS JOIN is a type of JOIN clause that is used to combine every row from one table with every row from another table. This type of JOIN does not require a common column between the tables, and will create a new, combined table that contains all possible combinations of rows from the original tables.\nIn summary, SQL JOIN clauses are an essential part of SQL and are used to combine rows from multiple tables into a single result set. There are several different types of JOIN clauses, each with its own specific purpose and syntax, and they can be used to perform a variety of operations on data from multiple tables.",

Whether you are Node.js or a React developer, understanding these methods is important as you will be asked many questions during interviews about them.\nGetting Started\nThe map method\nconst data = [ \n  { id: 1, name: 'shrey', count: 43 }, \n  { id: 2, name: 'parv', count: 23 }, \n  { id: 3, name: 'Dinesh', count: 58 },\n  { id: 4, name: 'Akhil', count: 14 }\n];\n\nIn the above example, the map function will iterate over every element of the data array and return the element with count > 30; else, it will return undefined.\ndata.map(item => if(item.count > 30) { return item })\n// the output array will be like this\n[ \n  { id: 1, name: 'shrey', count: 43 }, \n  { undefined }, \n  { id: 3, name: 'Dinesh', count: 58 },\n  { undefined }\n]\n\nNote that the size of the final array will always remain the same.\nThe filter method\ndata.filter(item => item.count > 30 );\n// the output array will be same as those return by map method but size will decrease.\n[ \n  { id: 1, name: 'shrey', count: 43 }, \n  { id: 3, name: 'Dinesh', count: 58 },\n]\n\nThis is way better than the map method because you are using less space in the final array and dealing with less size is faster.\nThe reduce method\nThe reducer method takes the element and keeps on adding the next element to it until it reaches the end.\nHelps to filter the single element from an array.\nHelps make calculations over an array to reduce the single value, for example, the total count of 4 students can be easily calculated using reduce method.\nDoes not change the original array\n\n\n\n\ndata.reduce(item  => { if(item.count > 30) { return item } })\n// will return { id: 1, name: 'shrey', count: 43 }\n\nConclusion\nSubscribe to our email newsletter to get such content once a week directly to your inbox. \n\nLink to subscribe\nKeep developing\nYoutube || iHateReading || Twitter",

A key-value database stores data as a collection of key-value pairs in which a key serves as a unique identifier, which is called the Primary Key.

          "description": "埃隆·马斯克证实，加密私信即将到来! 这是好东西。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n今年早些时候，埃隆·马斯克 在 Twitter 上表示：Twitter 的 私信Direct Messages（DM）需要像 Signal 协议这样的 端到端加密End-to-End Encryption。\n\r\n早在 2016 年，爱德华·斯诺登就 要求 Twitter 的前首席执行官兼联合创始人杰克·多尔西添加 Signal 协议类似的安全措施到 Twitter 平台。\n\r\n但是，这个协议从来没有被添加到 Twitter。它可能经过测试但还未部署实施。\n\r\n根据最近的公告，Twitter 似乎即将实现这个安全协议 😌。\n\r\n马斯克分享了他在公司演讲中的几张幻灯片，其中就包括为 Twitter 2.0 路线图规划的“加密私信”。\n\r\n🔒 Twitter 通信的 Signal 协议\n\r\n\n\r\n虽然有一些安全研究员，例如 黄文津，已经在 Twitter 的 iOS 和 Android 应用程序中发现了对 Signal 协议 的代码引用。\n\r\n但是直到现在，埃隆·马斯克才在 推文 中确认了该计划，该推文介绍了根据 “Twitter 2.0” 路线图将对 Twitter 平台进行的改进。\n\r\n换句话说，埃隆·马斯克正式确认 Twitter 即将推出加密私信。\n\r\n\n\r\n对于那些不知道 Signal 协议的人，我们简要地介绍一下 Signal 协议：Signal 协议是一种开源的加密协议，它允许以 完全前向保密perfect forward secrecy（PFS）方式实施端到端加密。\n\r\n该协议使用 “双棘轮算法Double Ratchet algorithm”，通信双方根据不断变化的共享密钥，来交换加密的消息。\n\r\n这确保没有第三方可以得到通信消息的内容，因为共享密钥仅存在于通信双方的设备上。\n\r\nSignal 应用程序充分利用了这个方法。但是，进一步来说，还有几个以隐私为中心的替代方案：\n\r\n（LCTT 译注：Signal 协议是一种真正的端到端加密的通讯协议，号称是世界上最安全的通讯协议。只有参与通讯的用户可以读取并解密信息，而任何第三方（包括服务器）都无法查看到通讯的内容。总的来说，它可以防止潜在的窃听者（包括：通信服务商、互联网服务提供商甚至是该通讯系统的提供者），获取能够用以解密通讯内容的密钥。目前有大量即时通讯软件也使用或借鉴参考了 Signal 协议，例如：Skype、What'sApp、Facebook Messenger）\n\r\nSignal 协议如何帮助 Twitter DM？\n\r\n它可以防止恶意攻击者和政府去窥探 Twitter 用户的消息，从而使 Twitter 成为一个更加安全的平台。\n\r\nTwitter 添加加密私信会对举报人、记者和社会活动家有益，因为他们经常会因其工作而面临被审查或成为攻击目标。\n\r\n诚然，就隐私而言，加密私信可能不是最严格的保护措施。但有总比没有好。\n\r\n🔏 加密消息应该成为通讯软件的标准\n\r\n在这个动荡的信息时代，我们看到更多的恶意攻击者试图未经授权访问敏感信息。\n\r\n端到端加密应成为所有通讯软件的必要标准，我希望 Twitter 能够尽快添加它。\n\r\n你有什么想法吗？请在下面的评论区中分享你的想法吧。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/twitter-signal/\n\r\n作者：Sourav Rudra 选题：lkxed 译者：chai001125 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Rust 叫好不叫座\n\r\n据 2022 年 Stack Overflow 开发者调查，只有 9% 的开发者在使用 Rust，但它已经在“最受喜爱”的语言中占据了七年的位置。在今年的调查中，几乎有 87% 的开发者表示他们喜欢 Rust，这比第二大受欢迎的语言 Elixir 高出约 10 个百分点。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Stack Overflow\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看起来发展很好，而且已经进入了 Linux 内核，但是离撼动 C 和 C++ 的位置还需要很长的时间。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nDocker Hub 至少有 1600 个公开镜像带有恶意行为\n\r\nDocker Hub 是一个基于云的容器库，允许人们自由搜索和下载 Docker 镜像。除了由 Docker 库项目审查的镜像之外，在该服务上还有数十万个状态不明的镜像。Sysdig 使用其自动扫描器仔细检查了 25 万个未经验证的镜像，并确定其中 1652 个镜像是恶意的。这些恶意行为包括加密矿工、隐藏的认证凭证等。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Bleeping Computer\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：未经验证的 Docker Hub 上的镜像是非常危险的。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n新加坡将每棵大树都连上物联网\n\r\n新加坡大约有 700 万棵树，他们通过一个巨大的物联网监测计划对 600 万棵大树进行监控。新加坡国家公园管理局用一个应用程序来管理它们，除了用 LiDAR 采集数据，对每棵植物进行地理定位之外，还通过卫星遥感进行多光谱分析，以确定叶绿素水平，确保树木仍然茁壮成长，以及在树木上安装倾斜传感器确保树木没有被移动或倾倒。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这是不是可以叫做“树联网”。",

          "description": "OPTION-O Lagom mini 是一群澳洲的咖啡爱好者工程师在 2016 年决定结合自己的工作技能和爱好技能打造的产品，是近年来比较流行的创业故事。\nLagom mini 首先在外形上就和传统磨豆机大相径庭，许多网红磨豆机是把磨豆机的颜值提升到了极致，但你还是能一眼看出来这是个磨豆机，调节转盘、豆仓、方方正正的造型，该有的都有。而 Lagom mini 则是三个有着浓郁 「苹果范」 的铝合金圆柱体，不管是银色的铝合金光泽还是 CNC 痕迹都像极了 Mac 电脑，圆柱体中集成了刀盘调节装置 —— 圆柱中裂出的一条缝，如果不仔细看，就是三个矗立在那的银色圆柱。\n\n同时也得益于高度集成的设计，Lagom mini 体积极小，抛开大的不和谐的电源，Lagom mini 的机身比手摇磨豆机大不了多少，或者说这就是一个有着电机驱动和更稳定结构的手摇磨豆机，就像 Mac mini，比 MacBook / 手摇磨豆机大一点，你还需要外接电源工作，但你确实可以将它们带出房间，而不是像传统台式机和电动磨豆机那样局限在房屋里，在 Glamping 火热的当下，这个优点极其突出。\n\n致敬苹果的不仅是外观设计，还有对磁铁的运用，接粉罐和底座通过磁吸连接，只要放过去就能自动归位，让出粉口对准罐子，避免撒漏。还有豆仓盖也是嵌入了磁铁，放进豆子，盖子也是自动归位，非常巧妙的设计。\n\n还是因为出色的结构设计，Lagom mini 调节简单，最大的圆柱体其实是由两部分组成，拧动调节间距挤压上下刀盘的距离就能调节磨豆的粗细，从意式到手冲到法压壶都能胜任，不过不推荐意式，为啥放缺点那讲。\n\n作为一台磨豆机，其核心当然是高精度、稳定、均匀的研磨，和所有定量设备一样，只要想做到稳定的高精度，其难度和成本必然是成几何级增长的，这也是比 200 块的磨豆机优秀的地方。Lagom mini 的 48mm 锥刀粒径分布均匀，我大概的用筛网筛了一下，极细粉少多了，最多的中间粉颗粒分布也均匀，能让做出的咖啡风味更稳定，不会一次酸一次苦的。\n冲煮前后的咖啡粉\nLagom mini 的一大特色是 「零残粉」，它的出粉通道设计的很巧妙，在锥刀下有三扇摆动叶片，随着锥刀一同旋转将磨碎掉落下的咖啡粉扫到出粉口掉出，将出粉通道缩减到最小，这样就几乎没有残粉了，根据我的试验，正常情况下进豆和出粉的重量差一般都在 0.1 克内。\n如果你还不满意，可以和我一样购置一个 3D 打印的吹粉豆仓盖，用按压吹一吹，不过由于接粉罐很小，30 克豆子就有溢出的风险了，如果再一吹，就很容易吹的到处都是，如果 Lagom mini 能把接粉罐的直径做大一圈，同时让出粉口内插进去而不是像现在这样出粉口悬浮在接粉罐上沿 2mm 的位置，完全杜绝散落就完美了。\n\n目前看，吹气豆仓在吹残粉有咖啡粉漫天飞舞的隐患，而小拨片和老式的敲打都不够优雅，可能泰摩那扭一扭的机关扳手才是完美形态吧。\n除开以上，Lagom mini 最大的问题是静电消除不够好，大概是全金属机身的天生缺陷吧，每次磨完豆子，豆仓内一定会遗留大量的银皮粉屑混合物，丢失的 0.1 克大概就在这吧。如果用喷水老办法能缓解一部分，不过会带来新问题 —— 豆子粘在豆仓壁上下不去，甚至是直接卡在颈口，就很尴尬，每次磨完都得打开瞅一瞅。\n\n再吹毛求疵点，一是硕大的电源能不能小型化一点，不知道的还以为是老款 MacBook Pro 的电源呢，如果能改成 C 口支持移动电源直驱就更完美了。二是磨豆速度有点慢，磨 20 克豆子能要个小一分钟，如果是磨 Espresso 的细度，那得到地老天荒。\n\n满分的话，我能给 Lagom mini 打上个 86 分，足够跨入优秀磨豆机的行列，只是优秀如鲠在喉的小问题让你用的没那么顺畅，作为初创团队的首款作品还是值得赞扬的，希望二代能保留优点改进不足，让家用磨豆机市场更卷一点。",

          "description": "前言\n环保问题一直是装修中大家密切关注的重点，毕竟即使选择E1\\E0\\F4级材料，新家具、新柜子都会有气味不断散发出来。装修材料内部和连接处使用的胶会不断分解，散发出醛类、苯系物等挥发性有机物，它们会对人体呼吸系统以及血液系统造成影响。\n\n所以新房通风散味除甲醛是每个家庭都重视的，我的房子次顶楼、南北通，楼前无遮挡，整体通风效果是非常好的。8月初定制柜安装完毕后，我就持续不关窗通风，10月中旬成品家具也正式入屋，后继续通风。两大新房空气污染源分别经过了3个月和一个月的连续通风，如今进入屋内的异样气味感已经明显减少了，为了确定新房的空气质量，计划开展新房空气的自测。\n甲醛检测的国标方法\n\n现在关注室内甲醛的人都知道，国标允许的室内甲醛最高浓度为0.10mg/m³，可靠的测试标准为GB/T 18204.26-2000《公共场所空气中甲醛测定方法》。\n检测的原理就是让空气中的甲醛与酚试剂反应生成嗪，嗪在酸性溶液中杯高铁例子氧化形成蓝绿色化合物，根据其颜色的深浅，以分光光度计检测标准溶液后进行比色，进而给出定量的检测结果。这一方法对醛类物质有很好的选择性，结果可靠。\n从化学角度来讲，这个是非常简单的测定实验，检测结果可靠的核心就是要有严格按照标准规定进行取样，吸收液配置准确，以及有计量溯源可靠的分光光度计和标准物质作为数据支撑。\n即使其它检测手段能向国标检测方法的结果进行标定，那也没有分光光度法的可靠性和准确度。\n分光光度法之所以准，是因为国标明确说明，仅有二氧化硫会对这方法的检测结果造成影响，一般家庭不存在二氧化硫。\n室内甲醛测试的手段与经济投入\n1：甲醛测试盒\n\n甲醛测试盒就是简易版的酚试剂测试法，可以不需要分光光度计，每份测试盒内带有酚试剂吸收液，自行根据指导方法封闭房间，摆放吸收液半小时后，倒入铁酸溶液，显色后对比测试盒内附带的比色卡，以肉眼充当分光光度计，来判断颜色情况。…",

          "description": "最近，我在尝试使用画图思考。虽然只是简单应用，但是收获颇丰，值得梳理总结出来。 我会从电脑和本子两个方面来说说自己的实践。\n电脑\n电脑软件上，我来说说 Excalidraw 和 Craft 这两款应用。\nExcalidraw\n\n说到画图，Excalidraw 这个应用肯定绕不过。我在电脑上的思路梳理，知识分享，还有学习的沉淀，都在高度依赖这个应用。它是一款在线的白板软件，风格和字体偏手绘风格，我很享受在上面涂涂画画的过程。\n\n思路梳理的时候，我会把自己的问题先写在白板上，然后自由发散，记录下现状。接下来，我会通过观察画布上的一个个关键字，去做分类的和关联的操作。在动手的过程中，很可能一些思路就已经慢慢出来。画布可以很好承载网状的思考，通过拖拽，连线，分层，让我在脑子里混乱的思绪，一步步清晰。如果看着画布上的关键字，一时没有找到解决方案，也不用着急，就安静观察，静下心来，慢慢琢磨。\n\n和朋友分享观点或知识，我亦经常在这个白板上画图。有了白板，我们讨论问题的时候，可以把一些发散的问题记录到一个位置，等主要内容分享完之后，回头继续梳理。白板的展示方式，可以更好吸引对方的兴趣和注意力。我也经常感受到，在和别人交流过程中画图，会不知不觉，产生一个新的观点，或者对自己的思路愈发清晰。\n\n最后说说学习的沉淀，抛开做笔记，我最喜欢的就是面对这个白板做知识的总结。写作困难的地方也许是从零开始，梳理知识应该也是。没有参考的情况下，列出知识大纲，结构化总结，是一件困难的事情。就是这种每次面对白板的梳理，让我可以更好检视自己的学习成果。同时，白板画图，使我我对分层学习，有了更直观的感受。\nCraft\nCraft 是一款笔记应用。这款应用好在配图和分享非常方便流畅。我在分享给朋友的一些文字上，会配上一张图片。不要小看文章或者句子的配图，这个配图如果合适，会加深对句子的印象。\n\n除了分享的配图，我还会在学习专业书籍时，对目录大纲做一个梳理，同样会配上方便我联想记忆的图片。看目录标题，思考关联图片，搜索图片，然后上传图片到 Craft 的过程，虽然繁琐，但实在是一劳永逸的事情。我回顾知识框架的时候，一看到图片，就会很自然想到，自己当时为什么选择了这种图，这张图含义是什么，大部分都可以直接根据图片，推敲出章节标题。\n\n找图片，激发自己使用右脑联想记忆，这个过程其实步骤很多。经常遇到找不到合适的图片来表达，在这时，我会在 Excalidraw 上画图。过程虽然花费不少时间，但是在这个思考和主动寻找关联关系的过程，其实已经在慢慢消化和记忆知识。\n\n本子\n便利贴\n我把便利贴当作一个有边界的草稿纸。我在想一些细碎问题的时候，会打开便利贴画一下思路和草图，一个问题，不会超过一张便利贴去思考。举个例子，上周的茶话会，分享前，我在便利贴上圈圈点点，画出大纲和思路。随后我把便利贴揉成一团丢掉，暗示自己思路已经准备就绪。\n\n便利贴的天然边界，和撕下来的特性，很好地辅助了我思考。生活中很多问题会突然出现，便利贴的便利性，就是良好的应对方式。它的第一页，在安静等待着你写写画画，接着被你撕下。一页便利贴没有过多的空间，这个特点，帮助我自然而然去聚焦问题的重点。\n子弹笔记\n为了让生活中很多琐事更有趣，我会在子弹笔记上，用画图的方式去给自己分配任务。比如，清理卧室，衣柜部分很多衣服需要清点，我就会把衣柜的实物画出来。当我清理完一部分格子，我会用荧光笔涂上颜色。\n我在实践中，体会到画图的三个优点。首先是直观，无论是进度还是已经完成的程度，我一眼看上去，都有直观的感知。其次是低压力，看图片去想自己要做什么，和看清单上的文字，压力不一样。最后是愉悦感，看图的时候，因为低压力和直观，让我做事的时候心情更好。\n\n除了通过画图拆分任务，我还使用荧光笔快速分类子弹笔记中的任务。比如，某一天傍晚，我打算采购想要购买的东西。由于子弹笔记是一般是按照流水线的方式记录要任务，我的本子上没有一个页面或者清单专门记录。\n\n很自然地，我拿起某个颜色的荧光笔，在本子上把这几天未完成的购买任务，涂上同样的颜色。很短的时间内，我就快速把购买的东西过滤出来，然后拿出手机去一件件下单。\n总结\n\n从电脑上的画图实践，我学习到，多画图可以捋清思路。合适的配图，能加深印象。在本子上的实践，我学习到便利贴的边界能辅助快速思考。最后是，眼睛，分辨颜色和形状效率很高。\n我的实践，如标题所言，确实非常简单。即便如此，这些实践也不是我自己凭空想象。《认知心理学》《游戏改变世界》《子弹整理思考术》《活用一辈子的读书笔记术》《一页纸工作整理术》，这五本书对我启发很大。学习和生活，都离不开知行合一。希望自己能够在成长的路上，多实践，多沉淀。",

          "description": "人要坚持一件事情真的很难，一不小心，少数派思考就鸽了一个多月。上周六我上了一次「得到」的直播，也是罗振宇老师的年度演讲策划会，在会上我提出了两个观点，在这里跟大家分享一下。\n用实业心态创业，用实业思维做互联网产品\n这句话其实在我脑海中已经很多年了，可能跟我之前从事的传统行业有关系。不管是做哪个行业和产品，我都非常在意它给用户提供的本质价值，比如我推销过纳米汽车清洁产品，就会一直纠结它的实际效果怎么样，不断反馈问题；我出口过弹簧钢丝，也更关注海外客户的使用反馈，了解我们的工艺跟其他国家的差距在哪里。\n但互联网的兴起，好像改变了这些底层规则，因为要快、要规模、所以要免费，羊毛要出在猪身上。不知不觉，服务和产品的本质都被动摇了。我非常感恩互联网，因为这个工具和时代，让给我有了创业的机会，帮我把爱好变成了事业，但我不迷信互联网，它是一个好工具，但不是产品和服务的本质。\n简单举两个例子：\n今天的外卖让我们的餐饮高效便利，但餐饮的本质是菜品和味道，如果菜品难吃又不干净，你送餐的速度的再快也没有意义，我能忍一次两次，忍不了第三次。\n今天的娱乐，让我们随时随地可以听音乐，看电影，但平台的争斗和互卷，让创作者无奈，让好的内容越来越少，最终变得没什么可看了。\n所以，一个产品和服务，要想保持长期可持续的生命力，就要回归用户需求，用实业思维把东西夯实，夯成自己的真正壁垒，它可能会很慢，规模也不大，但它可以穿越周期，做成百年老店。接下来十年，可能是一个慢下来的新周期，这个思维就更加重要。\n直播中有一个提前准备的问题，没来得及讲，我可以在这里补充一下：\n当下环境，你会给准备创业的朋友哪些建议和叮嘱？\n先想好怎样活下来，今天的市场更加残酷，没有红利、没有资本，用户更谨慎和挑剔。\n少讲故事，如果你的业务短期内没法商业化，就要想好长期策略，比如控制成本，小步快跑等等。\n别追风口，多关注细分市场的机会，关注年轻的主力消费人群，未来是创意和个性化的时代。\n不要社恐，不要闭门造车，要主动联络和运用身边的一切资源。\n创新不是颠覆，是将好做到优秀，再把优秀做成经典的过程\n这句话不是我说的，而是来自 150 年历史的德国莱茵公司。三年前我前往德国参观了他们的公司和业务，七天行程的结束，莱茵大中华区电子电气副总裁 Jay 总结了这句话，引发了我的思考。\n巧合的是，我八年前做出口业务的时候，有很多欧洲的客户，我去了解他们的背景，发现大多都是做了几十年的企业。他们都是深耕自己的领域，比如一家制造扫街刷子的公司，从塑料制刷改成钢丝刷，从扫街到扫管道，不停优化工艺，不停的延伸拓展，始终保持自己的市场地位。\n而互联网时代，我们经常讲创新，讲颠覆，强调一个技术出现，就会改变一个行业，我就是这个行业的佼佼者。我们承认趋势的存在，但趋势是波浪，一旦过去了，你还要靠自己的实力去创造价值，只是这个趋势周期比较长，我们还没有真正经历和感受过低谷。\n所以我后来一直思考这句话，它可能就是一个百年企业的运营真谛，不要觉得事情小，而是关注它的价值。150 年前的莱茵公司，是给蒸汽锅炉做安全认证的，因为品质不统一，操作不规范，它经常出现致命的事故，先做好这件事，保证工人的生命安全。后面再一点点拓展到更多的领域，最后形成了人人信赖的品牌。\n做一份少数派的报告\n虽然，以上这些海外企业的成长经历，跟我们的周期和环境有很大区别，但我依然认同这些底层的观点：把一件事情做好做透，拥有你最核心的用户群，先完成你基本的商业闭环，然后再围绕用户和市场的需求去慢慢拓展。这跟以往的互联网思维是基本相悖的，但从更高的维度和更长的周期来看，我依然相信这是正确的。\n我们在直播中聊到，是不是可以整理一个具备这些特质的企业清单，讲讲他们的故事，我们可以把它叫做真正的《少数派报告》，也希望这些案例，能在寒冬之中，引领更多创业者找到自己的方向。",

Of course, the files and folders are only virtual, and so software developers came up with the modern \"desktop\" user interface. Your screen is the top of your \"desk,\" which you can use as a surface for taking out files from their folders so you can review and work on them.

He also claimed that he would get the device implanted in his own head at some point in the future. \nDuring the presentation, Musk said that the company had submitted most of the paperwork needed for a human clinical trial to the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates medical devices in the United States. Previously, Musk had said that he’d hoped for human trials to begin in 2020, and then 2022.

In a video, you can see a shadow of two people: Musk and someone else that resembles Cook. \nGood conversation.
