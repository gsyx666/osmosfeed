They sell my name \"Haqem.com\" at USD$4,999. Whoa too expensive meh. I frustrated at that time! \nThen I'm waiting until 2018, finally the domain name is available to purchase. So happy to hear that sia, I faster make a purchase on Nov, 2018 for my name Haqem.com until now the domain still active.\nOk I think that's all for my personal now get back to main topic New to Dev.to.

Like a basic stopwatch we will have a display to show time, then we will have basic buttons for start, stop, resume and reset. As soon we will hit the start button, timer will be started and two buttons will appear stop and reset. By clicking stop, the timer will be stopped, and a resume button will appear. Lastly, the reset button will reset the timer back to 0 again.\nSo basically this is going to be a beginner-friendly project, so let’s make this project step-by-step.\nBasic knowledge of ReactJS.\nBasic knowledge of React hooks.\nBasic knowledge of React props.\nGood knowledge of React Components.\nLet us start with App.js component, we have imported DisplayComponent.js and BtnComponent.js components, in which we will add structure for button and display. Then we also imported useState hook, so we can make use of it to get variable time. Now we have created state for time with initial 0 values for ms,s,m,h, which is actually for millisecond, second,minute and hour.\nThen in return statement, we have called these two components in a div. And we have passed time as a prop for . Okay, so this is not for all for App.js we will do some changes as we progress in the Application.\nRead More\nThen in return statement, we have called these two components in a div.

          "description": "VLC 媒体播放器是 最好的媒体播放器 之一。这款跨平台播放器功能丰富，可以播放任何可用的媒体格式。\n\r\n你会惊讶地发现 VLC 不仅仅是一个视频播放器。它可以对你的媒体文件做很多事情。\n\r\n我们分享过 使用 VLC 下载 YouTube 视频 的 VLC 技巧。\n\r\n让我再和你分享一个。用 VLC 裁剪视频怎么样？这不是 裁剪视频 的最佳方式，但它可以作为一个选择使用。\n\r\n使用 VLC 裁剪视频\n\r\n在 VLC 中裁剪视频本质上意味着从所需部分的开头到结尾录制视频。默认情况下，录制控制工具通常在 VLC 面板中不可见。\n\r\n让我详细介绍一下步骤。\n\r\n步骤 1：启用高级控件\n\r\n要获取控件，你需要使其在主控制面板上可见。\n\r\n首先选择“视图View”选项，然后选中“高级控件Advanced Controls”复选框。现在，如截图所示，出现了带有几个按钮的新控件行。\n\r\n\n\r\n步骤 2：打开视频\n\r\n为了裁剪视频，你需要在 VLC 中打开它。你可以通过“媒体Media > 打开文件Open File”在 VLC 播放器中打开视频：\n\r\n\n\r\n或者你可以使用 Nautilus 文件管理器中的 VLC 打开视频文件：\n\r\n\n\r\n步骤 3：使用 VLC 的录制功能裁剪视频\n\r\n打开视频文件后，将时间线设置为所需输出的起点并暂停视频。之后，按“录制”按钮并播放视频。\n\r\n\n\r\n当达到所需输出的终点时，暂停视频并再次按下“录制”按钮停止录制。\n\r\n\n\r\n这应该将裁剪后的输出保存到你的 ~/Videos 目录中。\n\r\n\n\r\n故障排除：无法识别的输出文件\n\r\nVLC 以 .ts 文件格式录制视频。这在 VLC 中受支持，你可以根据需要使用它。但是 Ubuntu 中的许多其他播放器，包括本地视频播放器，都无法识别该格式。因此，在这种情况下，有两种解决方案。\n\r\nGnome-Video 提示安装 GStreamer 包\n\r\n当你尝试打开文件时，GNOME-Videos 会提示错误并建议安装 Gstreamer 多媒体编解码器。\n\r\n\n\r\n你可以点击上图所示的 “在 Ubuntu 软件应用中查找Find in Ubuntu Software” 按钮，这将打开 Ubuntu 软件中心。你可以在那里安装所需的编解码器包。\n\r\n\n\r\n同样安装 Gnome-videos 并使用它打开视频将解决问题。\n\r\n使用 VLC 转换视频文件\n\r\n如果你不想为此安装任何额外的软件包，你可以使用 VLC 本身将 .ts 文件转换为 mp4 格式以在任何其他播放器中播放。\n\r\n为此，打开 VLC 并在“媒体Media”菜单下选择“转换/保存Conver/Save”选项。\n\r\n\n\r\n现在，使用“添加Add”按钮提供需要转换的文件的位置，然后选择“转换/保存Conver/Save”，如截图所示。\n\r\n\n\r\n选择所需的输出配置（MP4）并为输出设置文件名，然后按“开始Start”。\n\r\n\n\r\n这将开始转换，并根据源的时长决定转换时间。完成后，你可以从 ~/Videos 目录访问转换后的输出。\n\r\n\n\r\n总结\n\r\n虽然确实可以使用 VLC 播放器来裁剪视频，但整个过程与专门的 视频编辑器 完全不同。\n\r\n最大的问题是你需要观看所有裁剪部分才能完成裁剪，如果你要裁剪跨越数分钟的视频的一大部分，这就不方便了。\n\r\n无论如何，这个很酷的功能在某些情况下可能是一个方便的工具，比如你想要的只是裁剪一个特定的小剪辑或从电影场景中制作一个 Gif。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/vlc-trim-video/\n\r\n作者：Sreenath 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "作为一名iPhone用户，快捷指令是系统中我觉得很有趣但实际上用得不是很多的应用。\n最初对快捷指令的理解仅限于将多个操作步骤简化成一个，最直观的应用就是在功能日益繁杂的APP中实现功能的一键直达，比如疫情期间的健康码。\n但深入探究一番后，我认为快捷指令的本质其实是打破各个APP沙盒的壁垒，实现不同应用程序的能力互通，提升个人的自动化水平。\n但事情情况并不尽如人意，虽然快捷指令编辑器提供了足够强大的编辑器，但三方应用对其支持并不好，大多数APP还是尽可能期望把用户圈在自己的生态中，没有开放足够的能力出来，这也是一款生态级应用的无奈。\n想象中的快捷指令\n现在应用商店的APP已经足够多，可以帮助人们解决足够多的问题，但有时候一款应用并不能完全解决某项任务，需要多个应用配合操作，如果用户可以随意调用应用中功能并组合成自己所需要完成特定任务的能力，那么用户体验和效率都将提升到新的高度。\n想象一种场景，当我在观看自己感兴趣的外语视频时，因为语言的障碍可能不能足够理解视频内容，我需要一些辅助支持：我希望翻译软件能够帮我把外语翻译成母语，甚至希望语音合成软件将翻译后的语言读出来。孤立地看这个场景中的每个需求，都有应用能很好得实现：视频网站能够提供我感兴趣的内容，翻译软件能将语言进行较高准确度的翻译，语音合成软件能够将文字朗读出来。但是当这三个需求点分布在三个不同的APP时，用户就难以较高效率完成这个场景的任务。实际上每个APP的能力都被封锁在了自己APP里面。\n\n上面说的这个场景我自己就有，但是因为没能使用现有工具很好使用，只得自己动手做了一个插件，可以朗读B站上面带有字幕的视频，因为微软的中文语音合成做得比较好，所以先放在Edge浏览器上了，目前还只支持带外挂字幕的视频，大家感兴趣也可以使用。\n\nB站视频字幕朗读（中文同传）插件地址-> Microsoft Edge Addons\n现实中的快捷指令\n虽然当前快捷指令还不够优秀，但对于日常效率的提升还是有一定帮助的，特别是对于实现与苹果自带应用的互通。\n举个使用的例子，每天早上我会用笔记软件记录一下昨日回顾、思考以及今日的计划，对于今日计划，我希望用待办应用去跟踪计划中事项的状态，但是手动把写过的东西在另一个APP里面再写一遍实在是太过愚蠢，于是我就写了快捷指令去实现。\n\n实际使用中，只要选择对应的文本并在共享表单中点击对应的操作就可以同步到系统自带的提醒事项中，在mac上还可以添加快捷键一键实现（应该还可以通过「自动化」省去手动操作这一步）。\n当前的快捷指令有三个亮点：\n\n在快捷指令的编辑上采用图形化拖拽操作，相对于写脚本，这种操作显得更加友好，并且也可以支持自定义脚本的加入，甚至让我一度觉得学编程的第一个应用是用快捷指令写得；\n在快捷指令的运行上打通了Siri、小组件以及共享操作，特别是后者，为与三方应用的结合提供了基础的平台；\n加入了自动化功能，可以根据一定的规则直接省去了用户主动调用快捷指令这一步。\n\n但要让更多的人在更多场景下使用快捷指令，还有着一些明显的不足：\n\n上手使用上有一些门槛，官方没有详细的教程，虽然提供了一些案例，但是大多数人应该没有耐心仔细去看快捷中心中那些精选的指令是如何实现的，这点Mac上快捷指令前辈「自动操作」可能给点其启示，其中「录制」功能可以通过「我做给你看」自动识别操作中的事件；\n快捷指令的分发做得还不够，既然不是每个人都能轻松使用快捷指令，那么获取现成的快捷指令则更加重要，但快捷指令中心中精选的指令本土化、个性化做得并不好，我觉得如果能根据用户所安装的APP来个性化分发常用的快捷指令会更友好；\n三方应用的能力开放明显不足，大多数的使用场景还是围绕在苹果自带应用提供的能力，这点极大限制了快捷指令的应用场景；\n使用Siri来激活快捷指令时对于指令的识别非常差，官方有说使用快捷指令的名称就可以通过Siri调用，但实际使用时不时语音识别不出来就是调用的指令不正确；\n\n有趣的是，在WWDC2022中，我们看到苹果开始推广App Intent框架，通过为应用开发者提供更多系统级的入口曝光来吸引他们将其应用所能满足的用户意图曝光给系统，从而使得系统可以通过学习用户行为实现跨应用的能力整合。\n结语\n很多人即使生活中充满重复的事情也不会去探索提高效率方式，因为对比眼前简单的操作，去探究增进效率操作的所花费的学习努力带来的成本更加高，只是把时间线拉得足够远，才能看见效率提升所带来收益。\n自动化所存在的意义是帮助人完成任务并节省时间，虽然我们每个人都已经拥有足够多的计算设备，但我们并没有充分发挥其拥有的算力，个人的自动化仍是一个尚待开发的领域。\n期待未来的快捷指令能为个人的自动化增添更多的可能性。",

I'll cover the basics of open source, whether you're interested in contributing to a project or want to be in the loop at a new job where the term keeps getting thrown around.\nFull disclosure: I am a person with little technical experience, working in the content-design fringes of a very technical open source environment.

Ryne Miller, the general counsel at FTX US, didn’t confirm a hack, but said on Twitter that the company made the move to “mitigate damage” caused by the potential theft, as transferring funds offline, or to “cold storage,” helps prevents outsiders from gaining access to them.\nThe millions in funds evaporated from the platform shortly after FTX filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on Friday, affecting the domestic FTX US trading platform, the global version of FTX, and Alameda Research.

Apple’s 10th-gen iPad is on sale for $399 at B&H Photo in its base 64GB configuration with Wi-Fi. While this new model comes in four different colors, B&H’s $50 discount is only on the blue one — at least, until November 13th at 11:59PM ET when this deal is set to expire (if it doesn’t sell out first).\nThis new iPad model may not be the no-brainer purchase its base-model forebears have been — since it starts at a much higher price than the ninth-gen version, which is still available for $299 — but it’s got some nice improvements.

          "description": "@SocialBoat\n\nToday we launch SocialBoat for Women. Motivation to create this came from my mom's (@seema_jain3) fitness journey. I have seen the handwork and struggles she put in to get fit and how it essentially transformed her life. \n\nSome critical problems that I saw -\n1. Lack of time \nMy mom used to manage the home, and this essentially made her mornings and evenings very busy. Mid day is usually too hot to workout outside and fitness centers are usually closed at this time.\n\nI would see her get up at 5am :sunny: everyday, to go for her quick 30 minute walk.\n\n2. Lack of relevant programs \nMy mom gained a lot of weight post her pregnancy, and she struggled to find any relevant programs to lose it. Most gyms had male oriented bulk up programs, and fitness classes were usually too intensive for her.\n\nShe started learning Yoga from a book, and then Pilates from YouTube videos. She tells me it took her 4 years to gain the confidence she had back in college.\n\n3. Her New Program for women \nAfter her at home transformation, she learnt jazz and hip hop dance, performed at multiple venues around the country and recently started a fitness program for women called - Yogalates. An amalgamation of yoga, pilates and dance for women.\n\nShe takes classes on zoom and more than 100 women have joined her program.\n\nScaling up the concept \nOur goal with SocialBoat is to take some of these learnings and make high quality fitness accessible to >100M women around the country.\n\n- A program one can follow from their home\n- Is accessible anytime during the day\n- Tailored to women specific needs\n- Evolves with different life stages\n\nExcited to see how people at ProductHunt find it. Please reach out to us if you have any questions or suggestions!\n\nThank you\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "@tw__ recently got into programming and so we decided to build a small project together. It was important to us that it had a manageable scope but was still useful. So we agreed to build a wishlist app that let's you organize your wishes and share them with your friends and family.\n\nThere are already dozens of apps like this out there with similar features, but we found them incredibly frustrating and confusing to use, therefore our goal was to try and build an app that works better and has a more modern look.\n\nSome highlights of the Wishbear 🐻 app:\n\n- 👤 No registration required, starting to use the app is literally just a single click of a button. Your session will be stored in your browser but you can submit your email address at any time in order to access your wishlists on other devices.\n\n- ✨ When you add a wish from a link to an online shop, the product details will be loaded for you automatically. That works for almost every shop out there, with a few exceptions that don't provide metadata or block our crawler.\n\n- 🔐 Visitors of your wishlist can mark your wishes as reserved so that nothing is given away twice.\n\nGive it a try, it's really easy to get started and we'd love to hear what you think!\n\nCheers,\nNiklas & Thomas\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
