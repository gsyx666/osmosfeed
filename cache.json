Hooks are built-in APIs that come with React and allow developers to interact with React state and lifecycle features in React. Hooks do not work inside classes, so they can only be used inside functional components. Developers can also decide to create custom hooks.\nReact allows for developer discretion, and more so than most UI libraries, it enables you to rethink the standard approach to designing UI components, such as by creating views using React and JSX's abstraction mechanism rather than the typical DOM specification.\nIn this article, we will discuss the…",

This is because the useRef hook does not cause any rerenders. It is used to store the reference of the DOM element.\nIn this blog we saw how to use useRef hook instead of useState hook. This is useful when we want to store the value of the input field without causing any rerenders 👌\nSo that's it for this blog.\nTwitter <3",

Unfortunately, right now, its only supported for deno test but not for deno run.\nThis seems unnecessarily limiting, since it makes measuring coverage in a running Deno server by running API tests against it convoluted - but not impossible. This blog outlines a workaround that lets you achieve just this. Thanks to an idea from zachauten.\nLet's say you had a bunch of Postman API tests written up for testing a Deno HTTP REST API server that you execute using the excellent newman CLI collection runner. Further, lets say you wanted to measure code coverage from running these API tests.\nYou would think you would be able to do something like this:\n# Start Deno HTTP server and put it in background\ndeno run…",

          "description": "在这篇文章中，我们将介绍如何在 Ubuntu 服务器 22.04 上设置静态 IP 地址。\n\r\n\r\n强烈建议在 Linux 服务器上使用静态 IP，因为它会在重启后保持不变。静态 IP 对邮件服务器、Web 服务器和文件服务器等服务器起着重要作用。\n\r\n准备条件\n\r\n\r\n最小安装的 Ubuntu 服务器 22.04\n\r\n具有 sudo 管理员权限的普通用户\n\r\n\r\n在 Ubuntu 服务器 22.04 中，网络由 netplan 程序控制，因此我们将使用 netplan 在 Ubuntu 服务器上配置静态 IP 地址。\n\r\n注意：我们不能使用 nmcli 程序，因为它不是 Ubuntu 服务器上默认安装的一部分。\n\r\n在 Ubuntu 服务器 22.04 上设置静态 IP 地址\n\r\n登录到你的 Ubuntu 服务器 22.04，查找 netplan 配置文件。它位于 /etc/netplan 目录下。\n\r\n$ cd /etc/netplan/\r\n$ ls -l\r\ntotal 4\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 116 Oct 12 04:03 00-installer-config.yaml\r\n$\r\n\n\r\n运行以下 cat 命令以查看 00-installer-config.yaml 的内容。\n\r\n注意：配置文件的名称可能因你的设置而异。由于它是一个 yaml 文件，因此请确保在编辑时保持缩进和语法。\n\r\n$ cat 00-installer-config.yaml\r\n\n\r\n输出：\n\r\n\n\r\n根据上面的输出，它说我们有 ens33 接口，它正在从 DHCP 服务器获取 IP。查看接口名称的另一种方法是通过 ip 命令。\n\r\n现在，要配置静态 IP 代替 DHCP，使用 vi 或 nano 编辑器编辑 netplan 配置文件并添加以下内容。\n\r\n$ sudo vi 00-installer-config.yaml\r\n# This is the network config written by 'subiquity'\r\nnetwork:\r\n  renderer: networkd\r\n  ethernets:\r\n    ens33:\r\n      addresses:\r\n        - 192.168.1.247/24\r\n      nameservers:\r\n        addresses: [4.2.2.2, 8.8.8.8]\r\n      routes:\r\n        - to: default\r\n          via: 192.168.1.1\r\n  version: 2\r\n\n\r\n保存并关闭文件。\n\r\n\n\r\n在上面的文件中，我们使用了以下内容，\n\r\n\r\nens33 为接口名称\n\r\n用于设置静态 IP 的地址\n\r\nnameservers 用于指定 DNS 服务器的 IP\n\r\n用于指定默认网关的路由\n\r\n\r\n注意：根据你的环境更改 IP 详细信息和接口名称。\n\r\n要是上述修改生效，请使用以下 netplan 命令应用这些更改：\n\r\n$ sudo netplan apply\r\n\n\r\n运行以下 IP 命令查看接口上的 IP 地址：\n\r\n$ ip addr show ens33\r\n\n\r\n要查看默认路由，请运行：\n\r\n$ ip route show\r\n\n\r\n上述命令的输出。\n\r\n\n\r\n完美，以上命令的输出确认静态 IP 和路由配置成功。\n\r\n这就是这篇文章的全部内容。请在下面的评论部分发表你的问题和反馈。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.linuxtechi.com/static-ip-address-on-ubuntu-server/\n\r\n作者：Pradeep Kumar 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "前天，我收到了腾讯官方发来的一个警告：\n\r\n\r\n“因用户投诉并经平台审核，你的小程序涉嫌滥用小程序接口能力，影响用户体验行为。”\n\r\n\r\n惊讶之下，我发现是我们几年前为了解决公众号文章内不能放置链接而开发的“文章助手”小程序被警告了。\n\r\n众所周知，一般情况下，微信文章不能像网页一样放入链接的。对于一般的文字性内容，这其实并无大碍，但是对于我们这种技术类文章，常常会有一些链接，以便读者可以深入了解相关内容。因此，这种限制对我们来说是一种缺陷，为了解决这种问题，我们陆续想过几种方法，比如利用文末的“阅读原文”、在文章内注明完整链接等。最后，我们在 2019 年想到可以开发一个小程序来 辅助提供 这个链接。\n\r\n通过一些 简单的方式，可以在你的微信文章中需要放置链接的地方嵌入这个“文章助手”小程序。用户只需要点击该小程序链接，即可显示该链接，并自动复制链接到剪贴板，然后只需要打开浏览器粘贴访问即可。\n\r\n我自己对这种委曲求全的解决方案感觉比较满意。\n\r\n现在，这个有两年没有继续添加新功能的小程序被警告了。于是我仔细查看了警告内容，在腾讯官方提供的《微信小程序平台运营规范》中是这样说的：\n\r\n\r\n5.15.4 滥用操作剪切板接口\n\r\n在用户使用剪切板功能进行复制操作后，恶意、强行中断小程序内功能服务或业务的完整流程，要求用户跳转或使用其他方式才可完整体验业务流程，影响用户体验。\n\r\n用户未进行任何操作情况下，小程序默认读取用户剪切板信息。\n\r\n\r\n考虑到申诉基本上不会得到解决（事实上我申诉了，也被驳回了），我只能修改相关代码，将以下行为做了调整：\n\r\n\r\n不检测剪贴板内容长度（原本是为了避免当剪贴板内有较多内容而被覆盖）\n\r\n不自动复制链接到剪贴板，而需要用户手动点击一下才复制\n\r\n\r\n以我的估计，这样就不算滥用了吧？……\n\r\n然而，新版本提交之后，紧接着，“文章助手”小程序就被封了剪贴板能力：\n\r\n\r\n因用户投诉并经平台审核，发现帐号已发布的服务涉嫌滥用小程序接口能力，影响用户体验\n\r\n已封禁服务的“操作剪贴板”能力\n\r\n\r\n哑然。\n\r\n无奈之下再次发起无用的申诉（已被驳回），并寻求客服解答。经过漫长的等待，客服给出了如下答复：\n\r\n\r\n审核部门排查发现你的小程序内活动通过文本口令引导跳转其他渠道体验或进行，属于滥用剪切板能力 请开发者对小程序进行全面排查以及整改，将涉及违规的内容移除(包括但不仅限于内容展示、代码、路径等)，如有隐藏内容、路径、代码等，也需一并移除\n\r\n\r\n呵，合着是不让用户粘贴链接到浏览器啊！\n\r\n原本“文章助手”小程序内会提示用户“链接已复制，请在浏览器内粘贴打开”，看来这是摸了老虎屁股了。\n\r\n而没有剪贴板能力的“文章助手”小程序，可以说是已经失去了一半用处。\n\r\n那现在我有两个选择：\n\r\n\r\n放弃这个小程序（这样我也不用每个月支付云开发的 20 元费用，需要说明的是，这个小程序是完全免费，没有任何广告和赞助，公益提供给任何人使用的）；\n\r\n看看是否还有抢救的机会。\n\r\n\r\n考虑到这个小程序已经累计有了 16 万用户，并为近 50 万个链接提供过服务，如果就此关闭，是对既往用户的不负责。因此，经过我灵机一动，我考虑可以完整地显示链接，让用户自己复制，至于复制后干什么，我不说，我也不知道，我也不想知道。\n\r\n所以，你看的 0.4.7 版的“文章助手”就是这样了。\n\r\n至于这样是否还会触犯腾讯的禁忌，我就不知道了，只能说，大家且行且珍惜吧。",

          "description": "Kubuntu 22.10 可能不是最令人兴奋的升级。但是，它包括了一些有用的变化。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nKubuntu 是 Ubuntu 的一个官方版本，它在一个精致的 KDE 驱动的软件包中提供了很多功能。\n\r\nKubuntu 22.10 的发布带来了各种改进和一个 KDE Plasma 的更新版本。\n\r\n让我们来看看这个版本的亮点。\n\r\nKubuntu 22.10 有什么新变化？\n\r\n\n\r\nKubuntu 22.10 带来了很多更新，其中一些重要的更新包括：\n\r\n\r\nKDE Plasma 5.25\n\r\nLinux 内核 5.19\n\r\nPipeWire\n\r\nFirefox 104\n\r\nQt 5.15.6\n\r\n\r\n\r\n💡 Kubuntu 22.10 将被支持九个月，直到 2023 年 7 月。如果你想要稳定而不是功能，你应该更喜欢使用 LTS 版本。\n\r\n\r\nKDE Plasma 5.25\n\r\n\n\r\n尽管最近 KDE Plasma 5.26 已经发布了，但 Kubuntu 22.10 还是搭载了 KDE Plasma 5.25。\n\r\n然而，KDE Plasma 5.25 与 5.24 相比仍然是一个重大的更新，它包含了很多改进，例如，加强了对触摸板/触摸屏的支持，升级了用户界面等等。\n\r\n你可以阅读我们对 KDE Plasma 5.25 的报道来了解更多。\n\r\n\r\nKDE Plasma 5.25：颜色、主题和其他改进\n\r\n\r\n另外，你可以期待 KDE Plasma 5.26 作为一个小版本发布，而不是作为 Kubuntu 22.10 发布的一部分。\n\r\n默认采用 PipeWire\n\r\n像大多数基于 Ubuntu 22.10 的发行版一样，PipeWire 是这个版本的 Kubuntu 的默认音频/视频处理器。\n\r\n它取代了 PulseAudio，众所周知，它与 Ubuntu 22.10 不兼容。\n\r\nLinux 内核 5.19\n\r\n\n\r\nKubuntu 22.10 采用了最新的 Linux 内核 5.19，这应该会带来对 ARM SoC 和 Arc Alchemist GPU 的支持、Btrfs 的各种改进、对 AMD RDNA3 图形的初步支持等等。\n\r\n测试用的 Wayland 会话\n\r\n\n\r\nKubuntu 22.10 具有对 Plasma Wayland 会话的初步支持，但它仅用于测试目的，并不是一个完整的集成。\n\r\n\n\r\n其他升级\n\r\n其他一些更新包括：\n\r\n\r\n自定义桌面重点颜色\n\r\n默认浏览器是 Firefox 104 Snap\n\r\nQt 5.15.6\n\r\nLibreOffice 7.4\n\r\n改进的应用程序商店\n\r\n\r\n要探索更多关于该版本的信息，请参考 官方发布说明。\n\r\n下载 Kubuntu 22.10\n\r\n你可以从 Ubuntu 的中央镜像库 或其 官方网站 下载最新的 ISO。\n\r\n\r\nKubuntu 22.10\n\r\n\r\n它的官方网站可能需要一段时间来提供 ISO。\n\r\n💬 你对这个版本感到兴奋吗？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/kubuntu-22-10-release/\n\r\n作者：Sourav Rudra 选题：lkxed 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "之前，我在《论文读不懂怎么办？》一文中，给你介绍了论文阅读遇到问题时的几个解决方法。尤其是介绍了你可以求助的免费资源和路径，它们包括但不限于：\n\n幻灯\n博客\n视频\n课程\n代码\n\n那篇文章，在知乎上获得了 2600 个赞（截止 2022 年 10 月）。我相信，对于很多同学，起到了帮助。\n\n只不过，环境和技术在变化，我们解决问题的方法和思路，也应该与时俱进。\n这不，因为有了大规模自然语言处理模型的加持，阅读论文时遇到不认识的名词，或者无法理解作者的简单解释时，我们有了一种新的对策。\n具体的方法，就是人工智能替你阅读后，把内容综合整理，结合上下文转换成简单清晰的语言，再反馈给你。\n这个想法，其实并不新鲜了。翻看近几年自然语言处理领域的论文，你能看见不少相关的研究。\n只不过，那些研究成果只存在论文中，或者是在某个实验室的电脑里面，普通人根本无法接触，更不要说利用了。\n这回可不一样，有人（ \\@amanjha__ and \\@functionofjade）居然真的就做了个产品出来。\n这个应用的名字，叫做 explainpaper ，非常直白吧？\n\n使用起来也特别方便。不用去菜单里面点选找寻。只要你把论文传上去，高亮某一个词语、短语或者段落，人工智能就会自动为你解读。\n\n不仅如此，你还可以就着 AI 反馈的结果，继续追问。\n这种应用演示不大适合图文。所以我干脆为你做了 一段演示视频，你可以先看看。\n \n \n看完之后，感受如何？\n反正不少小伙伴表示，很兴奋。\n\n这东西背后的技术是啥？当然还是咱们的老熟人 ------GPT-3.\n其实 GPT-3 这模型的特点，说穿了就是大。因为模型庞大，参数众多，所以从海量语料库里积攒的「认知」就多。注意我这里刻意回避了「知识」这个词儿。\n\n（资料来源：t.ly/cY1kn）\n从上图中，你不难看到，现在的文本和代码生成中，GPT-3 都占据了重要位置。\n我喜欢共享内容的原因之一，是视频发出后总可以获得观众进一步的反馈。不少的问题，都会激发我的思考。\n例如有小伙伴在视频后面提问，说这个东西能不能帮着理解中文论文啊？\n\n这是个很好的问题。毕竟很多国内人文社科研究生平时阅读的论文，更大比例是中文的。\n我一开始觉得这个问题问得有些太贪心了。对于一个外国人做的刚上线应用，你指望人家立即支持阅读中文，还能看懂中文的研究论文，不大现实吧？\n刚要回复，我突然想起来 上次在 Lex 上面的教训了。既然 explainpaper 的底层模型是 GPT-3 ，那它本来就该认得中文啊。\n为了确保回答准确，还是实际测试一下吧。我传了一篇自己的论文上去。\n\n中文划线高亮之后，AI 反馈的结果让我有些吃惊。\n尽管 explainpaper 并不能直接用中文来解释信息。但它可以立即识别出「知识管理」就是 knowledge management ，然后进一步解释下去。\n下面这段解释，就更有意思了。\n\n它先广泛解释「插件」是啥，然后结合本文的上下文，指出 Roam Toolkit 是一种插件，并且描述了它的功能。\n不仅如此，从下图可以看出，就连划线的时候字符之间出现了空格间隔，也依然能正常识别和解释。\n\n下面，我故意找了个文中没有进行详细解释的「概念网络」，结果是这样的。\n\n我能确定，这解释里面出现的「宠物」、「猫」、「狗」啥的，肯定没在本文正文出现过。\nEvernote 这一段，让我愣住了。\n\nExplainpaper 居然是准确识别了这张表格，并且把内容总结梳理，然后用英文输出了出来。\n上述的演示，是不是回答了读者的问题呢？我觉得算不上。从需求分析来看，人家看中文论文遇到术语不清楚，自然是需要中文的解释。你再弄成英文给我，这......\n可换个角度想想，这东西帮助外国人阅读中文论文，可是再好不过了。遇到中文专业词汇，随时可以获得准确的英文解释，而且阐述还贴合论文的上下文。外国人读中文论文，将减少很多障碍。这或许可以快速提升中文论文的影响力，妙啊！\n另外，目前 explainpaper 缺乏中文解释能力，也给国内的开发者提供了发展空间。希望早日看到更多 AI 实际应用上线，帮助国人理解中文论文。\n我期待你能自己尝试一下这款在线应用。至少在目前，它是免费的。而且因为上传的都是公开发表的论文，也不存在用户隐私泄漏问题。所以可以放心大胆地尝试 ------ 特别是对于最近要写文献综述的小伙伴来说。\n欢迎你把自己测试的结果和经验心得，分享在留言区。咱们一起交流讨论。\n祝论文阅读愉快！\n如果你觉得本文有用，请充电。\n如果本文可能对你的朋友有帮助，请转发给他们。\n欢迎关注我的专栏「科研利器」，以便及时收到后续的更新内容。\n \n \n延伸阅读\n如何高效入门 Logseq ？\n互联网上的时光机器\n如何高效学 Python？\nVOSviewer 中文视频教程\n【知识星球精选】刻意练习区的辅助线",

          "description": "2022国庆七天，秋高气爽良辰美景怎可辜负？驾驶着 Model 3，带上小米 11 Ultra，一路向西北从惠州到桂林。\n\nModel 3 标续版提车于2021 年 12 月，表显续航 423 公里，1.6 万公里后表显降为 418 公里。\n去程全长 627 公里，途径佛山百利达广场特斯拉超充站充电一次约 15 分钟，在贺州境内高速上充电一次约 25 分钟。\n佛山百利达广场特斯拉超充站选址非常好，就在高速出入口附近，上下高速很方便。贺州境内高速上的快充表现不错，功率一度飙到充电 800 km/h 以上。\n\n提车至今对 Model 3 的续航表现基本满意，天气凉爽的情况下表显多少就能跑出多少，甚至有时候实际续航还会超出表显，不同天气状况下的真实续航表现可以看我的 B 站自驾游视频。\n晚霞迎接我们一路向西\n到达桂林市临桂区已是晚上 10 点 15 分左右，办好入住第一件事就是去吃一碗桂林米粉。可能因为去的是商业步行街，美食比较商业化，即使当时比较饿了，这碗粉也没有给我带来美味的感觉。\n\n重头戏在第二天的龙脊梯田之旅。龙脊梯田位于桂林龙胜县东南部和平乡境内的龙脊山。龙脊梯田距龙胜县城27公里，距桂林市80公里，景区面积共66平方公里，梯田分布在海拔300至1100米之间，坡度大多在26至35度之间，最大坡度达50度。\n从临桂区去龙脊梯田景区大门口要一个半小时左右，桂林真大啊，查了下比北京还要大 1 万多平方公里\n根据疫情防控要求，散客只能在景区收费处外面的广场购票，票价 80 元/成年人，和售票处价格一致。\n工作人员告知我们，双向单车道的蜿蜒的山路加上堵车，从景区售票处到龙脊梯田里的几个寨子还要差不多 1 个小时的车程。国庆期间人特别多，如果按常规路线开车去名气最大的大寨，开车到坐缆车的地方要 1 个多小时，排队花钱坐缆车还要1个多小时，工作人员收费给我们指明了一条别的路去千层天梯，美景不打折，还可以开车到达。\n\n工作人员收费指明的这条路应该是尚未完全开发的新路，路上看到了多处没有做固化工程的山坡，不少路段有落石和滑坡泥土，还有一个地方路面塌方，行驶起来要格外小心。\n使用长焦拍下这张照片，脑海里突然响起《断背山》的配乐，给人一种氛围宁静的感觉\n一个多小时后终于达到千层天梯，话不多说欣赏美景吧，看看小米 11 Ultra 记录的龙脊梯田，先来一张全景图。\n\n这张全景图是在千层天梯处拍的，当天天空中飘着淡青蓝色的烟雾，有一种烟雨朦胧的感觉，阳光洒在稻田上勾勒出明暗的分界线，小米 11 Ultra 非常好地还原了真实的色彩和光影。\n当时在梯田附近一家民宿停车吃饭，两荤一素一共三个菜（牛蛙+鱼+青菜+米饭）加免费停车 120 元左右，坐在民宿楼下的台阶上吃饭吹风欣赏美景十分惬意，可以说物超所值。\n\n使用小米 11 Ultra 以来最满意的就是它的长焦表现，镜头压缩空间集中表达内容可以拍出非常有故事感的照片。以下照片应该都是 5x-30x 范围内拍摄的（具体记不清了），画质表现超出预期，当天的良好光线也功不可没。\n 后期调色套了滤镜\n11 Ultra 的主摄表现不错，成片有光影层次，色彩过渡自然，数码味和锐化较少，和肉眼所见十分接近。\n\n当然，小米 11 Ultra 拍照也不是十全十美的，成像慢、多颗摄像头切换动画生硬、逆光自拍效果一般、超级夜景容易糊等等。不过考虑到 3699 元的价格，这些问题也都可以忽略了。\n最后附上一些桂林游玩期间的美图（部分有后期），推荐大家去桂林玩，一座现代和古典，先锋流行和土著闲适相结合的奇妙城市，当地人比较友善，这次去也没遇到宰客行为，花费物超所值，值得一去。",

          "description": "灵动岛是今年iPhone的热点更新。我们在早期的时候，看到了很多针对灵动岛的玩法，比如在岛的周围养宠物、用灵动岛打游戏、适配灵动岛的挖孔壁纸等。\n但是，这些玩法从系统和功能层面，并没有用到真正的“灵动岛接口”。在苹果开发者文档中，灵动岛实际上是一种“实时活动”。在某些用户需要实时关注状态变化的场景下，为用户展示信息。比如实时更新比赛数据、实时更新外卖进度、实时更新计时器、实时更新地图导航指引等等。\n如果iPhone安装了iOS 16.1系统，在iPhone 14 Pro机型上，实时活动可以在灵动岛和锁屏界面展示；而在非iPhone 14 Pro机型，则只在锁屏界面展示。\n\nOneWidget如何定位灵动岛？\n仔细阅读苹果开发者文档之后，我们发现实时活动的实现方式和小组件有非常多重叠的地方。同时，不管在锁屏界面还是“展开的”灵动岛位置，它的尺寸都很像中尺寸的桌面小组件。再者，实时活动不能够交互、也不能有动画、不能随时刷新，这些和小组件都太像了。所以，我们最终把实时活动定位成“一种特殊的小组件”。\n当我们把“灵动岛”定义为“实时展示的小组件”，那么一切就更简单了，原则上小组件能够实现的它都可以实现。只是我们需要额外思考，在锁屏和灵动岛这两个特殊的位置，用户凭什么要展开来用它。\nOneWidget怎么做灵动岛功能？\n在迭代产品的2年多时间里，OneWidget的各种类型的小组件从用户那里得到了很多不错的回馈。当我们复盘这些小组件，用户最关心的是三个关键词：实用、美观、趣味。所以，设计灵动岛这个特殊的小组件，我们应该做的也是实用、美观、趣味。另外补充一点，对于很多用户来说，美观、趣味也是一种实用价值，美观带来个性化的装饰、趣味带来功能的尝鲜探索。\n从实用和便捷角度，我们设计了“启动之岛”和“健康之岛”。\n从美观和趣味角度，我们设计了“宠物之岛”和“摆烂之岛”。\n\n如何开启灵动岛？\n如果iPhone更新到iOS 16.1以上，下载OneWidget 的3.6.0以上的版本之后，可以进入个人中心找到主入口。在灵动岛配置页面，选择需要开启的“岛屿”，当App进入后台或者切换到其他App，实时活动就已经开启在了锁屏界面和灵动岛区域。\n配置入口我们还单独设计了一些细节：会动的海平面、开启后的彩色提示框、预览效果等。\n\n宠物之岛\n用户可以在“宠物之岛”领养一个自己的电子宠物，它每天陪你玩、会饿、会困、会渴，在不同的状态下用户需要点击不同的操作。我们给宠物取了一个名字叫做“岛岛”，领养之后，在App内还会显示领养的天数。岛岛除了不同的状态，也有可能会出去玩耍，只有等他回来才能再次跟他互动。为了满足个性化，宠物“岛岛”还允许自定义颜色，现在我们支持了7种颜色的切换。\n\n启动之岛\n“启动之岛”可以允许用户添加快速启动App或者小程序的入口，常驻在锁屏界面和灵动岛里，展开之后即可点击一键直达的App。用户可以添加1~6的常用启动入口，根据添加的数量变化，图标和间距会自动调整来适应合适的布局。和锁屏小组件、桌面小组件一行，这里的启动器入口支持添加常用的App、微信支付宝的二级路径、微信和支付宝的小程序入口。\n\n摆烂之岛\n“摆烂之岛”将随机展示一些“反鸡汤”的插画和文案。这个功能为了满足“趣味性”，该卷的时候卷，该躺的时候也要好好躺。偶尔摆烂无可厚非，休息是人之常情。\n\n健康之岛\n“健康之岛”实时展示用户当天的健康数据，比如步数、运动时间、消耗能量、身高、体重等。尤其是对于每日会更新变动的数据，是可以查看更新数据的（不过目前系统刷新问题，会有较多延迟）。\n\n \n以上就是OneWidget关于灵动岛功能的思考和功能的介绍。希望帮助大家了解灵动岛，也能够帮助大家通过这些小功能体验到灵动岛（实时活动）的用法。我们将继续做好一个“装修产品”，带来更多实用、美观、有趣的功能。\n回见。",

Meta pushed back on these claims and accused the outlet of using “fabricated” evidence.\nAfter Meta and several experts online found inconsistencies in The Wire’s reporting, the outlet decided to suspend access to its stories on October 18th and conduct an “internal review” of the documents it used as evidence. It later retracted its report on October...\nContinue reading…",

In particular:\n\n- They're difficult for the viewer to follow\n- The area of focus is sometimes too small to see\n- An absence of context and flow\n- Overall: looks plain, flat, dry, and hella boring 😴\n\nPresenting elevates your demo so that it engages and captivates your audience:\n\n- Get going in minutes with simple controls\n- Designed to be easy to use, no experience required\n- Use multiple input types (video / image / text)\n- Zoom, rotate and pan animations ✨\n- Custom design formatting options\n- Export to video (in up to 4K resolution, 60FPS)\n- Presentation mode (like a powerpoint)\n\nWith Presenting, you can create an engaging presentation — just like the video in this post — which was put together entirely in the Presenting app itself, without any post-processing or editing.\n\nIf you're a designer, app maker, marketer, product manager or agency, you could find Presenting helpful to level up your presentations, whether they be portfolios, product videos, tutorials or sales pitches.\n\nEnough said — please watch the video and check out the website, where it's free to download the macOS app to try.\n\nFor extended use beyond the trial period, you'll need a license key from our store, which you can buy right now at a huge discount to celebrate this launch! 🎉\n\nIf you have any feedback, questions or comments, let me know! I'll be around for the next 48 hours replying to EVERYONE.\n\nThank you! 🥳\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

Existing methods for talent evaluation are insufficient for modern online-based work, leading hiring to happen within exclusive inner circles. This fails both builders and hiring organizations – thus a year ago, we teamed up to make your achievements matter again.\n\nWe at Kleoverse are developing the portfolio for web3 builders. We have built a protocol – Proof-of-Talent – to verify and record achievements on-chain. You can create skill scores based on your achievements and gather this information into an intuitive, highly actionable portfolio. Dozens of organizations are already looking for new talent based on close to 25,000 created portfolios.\n\nThis is what you can expect:\n\n📝 Web3 portfolio, designed and built to serve web3 builders\n⛓ Blockchain-verified working history with actionable skill scores\n⚡️ NFT-based badges for open-source contributions and other achievements\n🤝 +700 listed jobs from leading web3 organizations\n📈 Rapidly growing community of 25,000 signed-up users\n🛠 Tooling for organizations hiring builders\n📯 Lots more!\n\nProof-of-Talent verifies skills objectively and transparently. Our goal is to enable fair and highly accurate matches between projects and builders based on proven skills, not networks or status signals. Starting from web3, we want to uncover hidden talent across industries everywhere in the world.\n\nThe product is free to use for both users and organizations. We hope to see many of you in our community, joining our journey of revolutionizing talent measurement and signaling on the web 💚\n\nOur whole team will be here today answering your questions and chatting with the community.
