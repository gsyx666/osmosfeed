A kilt, which is a skirt with pleats at its back and resembling a long skirt of knee-length, is a garment that looks like a kilt. It is the Scottish national garb and has been associated with both the Irish and Scottish heritage for centuries. The ancient pedigree of the Irish kilt is not what most people know. It is believed that this trait was first incorporated into Irish heritage in 1800.\n*Irish Kilts – Are Irish kilts worn by the Irish?\n\nIf you see someone in a kilt, it is likely that you think he is from Scotland. Because kilts from Scotland are very well-known all over the globe, Did you know that kilts are a part of the Celtic heritage for many centuries?

          "description": "在中国，有各种节日，有各种情人节。\n\r\n最早是从西方传来的所谓公历 2.14 的“情人节”，后来又有了 3.14 的“白色情人节”。然后，人们觉得这些节的洋味太重，何不把中国的农历七夕当成中国传统的情人节呢？而随着二次元一代，谐音梗也开始流行，不知道是谁滥觞，5.20 也被当成了一种情人节，因为谐音是“我爱您”。\n\r\n前几天，我的朋友 aulus Wren 跟我说，有位内核开发者在 Linux 内核邮件列表中向 Linus Torvalds 请求，将刚刚准备进位到 6.0 的版本号在 5.20 上停留一次，他认为这是一个在中国宣传 Linux 的好机会。就在前几天，Linus Torvalds 刚刚在邮件列表中 宣布 了 Linux 5.19 正式发布，并通告下一个版本准备“进位”到 6.0 了。\n\r\n说起来 Linux 内核的版本号，比较有意思的是从 3.0 开始主版本号就没有什么特别的意义，只是当次版本号太大时，Linus 觉得过大的数字会让他困扰，因此就“进位”到主版本号了。比如，2.6.39 之后就是 3.0，3.19 之后就是 4.0，4.20 之后就是 5.0（之所以没有在 4.19 就开始进位，也许是 Linus 忘记了）。所以，按照这种不严格的 20 进制，该进位了。\n\r\n这位名叫 Zhang Boyang（让我们称他为“张同学”）的内核开发者在内核邮件列表中向 Linus Torvalds 发起倡议：\n\r\n\r\n您能不能考虑使用 5.20 作为下一个 Linux 版本号，而不是 6.0。“5.20” 这个数字在中文中是一个文字游戏，代表 “我爱您”，所以 “Linux 5.20” 在中文中可以被读作 “我爱 Linux”。 \n\r\n\r\n他认为，这可以引起一些广泛传播，可以宣传 Linux。这个 消息 传播到国内后，褒贬不一，有人认为这是一件有趣的事情，可以向更多不了解 Linux 的人宣传 Linux；也有人认为，这事太无聊了。\n\r\n但是这封邮件并未带来什么影响，可能是它发出的时间恰逢周末，也没有得到 Linus Torvalds 的回复。\n\r\n眼看过去了一周，合并窗口接近关闭了，看来修改版本号这件事希望渺茫，张同学 再次发出 了他的倡议，请 Linus Torvalds 考虑给该版本一个命名：\n\r\n\r\n您能不能考虑将下一个 Linux 版本（5.20 或 6.0）命名为 “I love linux”？……即使下一个内核版本号是 6.0，我想对于讲中文的人和不讲中文的人来说，表达我们对 Linux 内核的爱可能都是一个好主意。\n\r\n\r\n而历史上，Linux 内核的一些版本有特别的名称，比如 Linux 5.17 就被命名为 “Superb Owl”（“超级碗”的一个文字游戏）。\n\r\n这一次，他的邮件得到了六位中国的 Linux 内核开发者的支持。但是，依旧没有得到 Linus 和其它国家开发者的回应。\n\r\n在大家的回应中，有人对 5.20 这个节日做了进一步解释，以及表达了一个并不浪漫的已婚男人对各种情人节的紧张，并表示这样的 520 挺好，不需要专门准备礼物。也有人表示，这是内核列表里面一次较大规模的“文化输出”，就像我们对美国人的“超级碗”无感一样，外国人对我们的 520可能也没什么感受。\n\r\n原本，我以为，这件事就此作罢了。不料 Linus Torvalds 在昨天发布 Linux 6.0-rc1 时，专门提到了这件事，他说，\n\r\n\r\n如果你愿意，你可以继续叫它 “Linux 5.20”。\n\r\n\r\n并且，Linus Torvalds 在这份公告里面再次重申了，主版本号变化并不代表有根本性的变化，他早就摒弃了“主版本号是有意义的”的说法了，而采用分层的版本号只是为了使版本号容易记忆而已。\n\r\n老王觉得，张同学这件事办的很好，诸位在内核邮件列表回复的同学也很给力。说到底，我们对 Linux 就是一种热爱，为什么不借着各种可能的机会来宣传它呢？虽然，Linux 越来越用在各种严肃的场合，但是 Linux，乃至开源，其本底一直是一种极客文化，“Just for Fun”，所以，为什么不呢？虽然，由于文化差异，没有得到太多的回应，但是我们的“文化输出”才能让世界对我们有更多的亲近。\n\r\n那么，你的看法呢？\n\r\n另外，你认为这样的版本号有趣吗？你会向你的爱人（如果不是计算机的话）讲这个故事吗？为了这个有爱的版本号，你是否会为 Linux 内核或更广泛的 Linux 做些什么吗（比如去修个 Bug，让你的痕迹留在 Linux 5.20 中）？\n\r\n（题图修改自：ninchanese.com）",

          "description": "www.rocketlane.com). \n\nLast year in June, we came to you with Rocketlane, a purpose-built customer onboarding platform made for CS, Onboarding, and Implementation teams to help them:\n ⏰ Shorten time-to-value\n💪 Hit project goals consistently\n🤩 Deliver a 5-star customer experience\n\nIn the last 13 months, we’ve shipped a ton of features including templates, automated status updates, and built-in time tracking, to name a few. Our clientele includes the likes of Mixmax, Mosaic, Chargebee, Yellow.ai, Delhivery, and parcelLab and we are now a leader in Client Onboarding on G2.\n\nAccording to a study by Mckinsey, 70% of digital transformation projects fail and poor resource management is one of top reasons. Rocketlane aims to fix that! We’re\nthrilled to announce the launch of Resource Management. The module helps leaders with staffing and planning, and gives them visibility into the team's workload which is critical for projects with longer implementation cycles.\n\nThe key areas that this module will help you with are:\n\n➕ Workload balancing: Manage your team’s workload in real time. Get a complete picture of everyone’s capacity at a glance, and easily drill down to know additional details.\n\n➕ Resource utilization: See actual vs. budgeted hours and the members allotted to the projects along with the time they are spending on each project.\n\n➕ Demand forecasting: The module intuitively computes the demand, helping teams forecast with accuracy.\n\n➕ Resource planning: Add resource placeholders to templates so next time you create a project all your staffing requirements are automatically accounted for.\n\nWe’ve a 14-day trial so give it a spin and share your feedback! Link to Rocketlane's resource management: https://rocketlane.com/resource-...\n\nWe’re also offering a free Customer Onboarding Audit for the PH community. Visit https://maturitymodel.rocketlane... and get custom insights to improve your customer onboarding methodology.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

          "description": "Eraser is built for engineers. Technical whiteboarding requires a particular set of primitives. That's why Eraser replaces sticky notes with markdown support, code blocks, cloud icons, and code-generated-diagrams (aka diagram-as-code).\n\nEraser is built for speed. In real-time conversations, one less click and keystroke makes the difference between a fluid conversation and a clunky one. That's why we have a keyboard-first approach to diagramming and a clean, minimal UI. In Eraser you can drawn an entire diagram without your hands leaving the keyboard, and when you need a tool, it's easy to find.\n\nEraser can create visual docs. Too often, diagrams are drawn in some diagram tool and pasted into a doc editor. Updating content requires straddling two different tools. Eraser has a built-in note editor so you can write and draw in one tool. This makes it the ideal repository for your team's visual docs – technical design docs, architecture documentation, and system design interview artifacts.\n\nCurious to see more? Here are:\nA 90-second walk-through video\n12 short clips showing key features (scroll down on our landing page)\nA gallery for your inspiration\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

But 1,000’s of dollars for a changelog tool? In this economy? We figured “hey, why not make it free”, so we did!\nNow, even if you’re not using Ignition’s full set of GTM orchestration tools, you can easily:\n\n* 💬 Collect customer feature requests\n* 📈 Allow customers and teammates to vote, discuss, and prioritize feature requests\n* 📣 Publish announcements to internal teams and public changelogs\n* 🙋 Collect and segment lists of customers interested in upcoming features\n\nThe coolest part?  This is a natural extension of Ignition’s core product, so when you’re ready to really supercharge your launch process, you can easily connect these feedback and announcement workflows to product roadmaps, personas, and launch plans.  To celebrate, we’re even offering 90% off Ignition for the first year if you upgrade to a paid plan — just email “support [at] haveignition.com“ telling us you came from Product Hunt and we’ll apply your discount :).\n\nHopefully Ignition helps some of you out <3.  \n\nWould love to hear what you think!\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
