These operators then return new data collections, which allows the chaining of operators in a functional way while keeping scalability in mind.\nFor most data engineers, Spark is the go-to when requiring massive scale due to the multi-language nature, the ease of distributed computing or the possibility to stream and batch.

          "description": "What is Telehealth and Telemedicine?\n\n\nTelehealth app development and Telemedicine app development are both used to improve patient health outcomes by providing remote access to medical care. Telehealth app development allows patients to connect with doctors and other medical professionals using their smartphones, laptops, or other devices. This type of app development can be used for a variety of purposes, including monitoring vital signs, sending reminders for appointments or medications, and providing educational resources. Telemedicine app development takes telehealth one step further by allowing patients to consult with doctors and other medical professionals via video conferencing. This type of app development can be used for a variety of purposes, including diagnosis and treatment o…",

          "description": "Keys in React\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Introduction to Keys\n\n\nA “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements in React. Keys are used in React to uniquely identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted. In other words, we can say that keys are used to give an identity to the elements in the lists. It is recommended to use a string as a key that uniquely identifies the items in the list.\nBelow is the updated code with keys:\n\nThis code will give the same output as that of the previous code(demonstrated in the List module) but this time without any warning. Keys are the most useful when we create components dynamically or when there is alteration of any sort in the list.\nConsider a situation where you have created a separate component for list items and you are extracting list items from that component. In that case, you will have to assign keys to the component you are returning from the iterator and not to the list items. That is you should assign keys to and not to “li” tag. A good practice to avoid mistakes is to keep in mind that anything you are returning from inside of the map() function is needed to be assigned a key.\n\nMenuItems is the component to be extracted.\nNavmenu is the component that will return an unordered list.\n\n\nThe code above can be found in the link given below:\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/keys-in-comp-qbuoks",

          "description": "为了简化 Java 的繁琐，我制作了一个 Groovy 工具来分析我的音乐目录。\n\r\n\r\n最近，我一直在研究 Groovy 是如何简化略微繁琐的 Java 的。在这篇文章中，我开始了一个简短的系列，通过创建一个分析我的音乐目录的工具来演示 Groovy 脚本。\n\r\n在本文中，我将演示 groovy.File 类如何扩展和精简 java.File 并简化其使用。这为查看音乐文件夹的内容提供了一个框架，以确保预期的内容（例如，cover.jpg 文件）就位。我使用 JAudiotagger 库 来分析音乐文件的标签。\n\r\n安装 Java 和 Groovy\n\r\nGroovy 基于 Java，需要安装 Java。 Java 和 Groovy 的最新和稳定的版本可能都在你的 Linux 发行版的仓库中。 Groovy 也可以直接从 Apache Foundation 网站 安装。对于 Linux 用户来说，一个不错的选择是 SDKMan，它可用于获取 Java、Groovy 和许多其他相关工具的多个版本。对于本文，我使用以下 SDK 版本：\n\r\n\r\nJava：版本 11.0.12-open 的 OpenJDK 11\n\r\nGroovy：版本 3.0.8\n\r\n\r\n音乐元数据\n\r\n最近，我重整了我的音乐消费方式。我决定使用优秀的开源 Cantata 音乐播放器，它是开源 MPD 音乐播放器 的一个前端。我所有的电脑的音乐都存储在 /var/lib/mpd/music 目录下。在该音乐目录下有艺术家子目录，在每个艺术家子目录下有专辑子目录，包含音乐文件、cover.jpg，偶尔还有 PDF 格式的内页说明。\n\r\n我绝大部分的音乐文件都是 FLAC 格式的，有一些是 MP3 格式，可能还有一小部分是 OGG 格式。我选择 JAudiotagger 库的一个原因是它可以透明地处理不同的标签格式。…",

          "description": "我们在使用 Fedora Linux 时有不同的偏好。例如，有些人选择 Fedora Linux，是因为 Fedora Workstation 默认使用 GNOME 作为其桌面环境。但也有一些人想使用 Fedora Linux 但想使用不同的桌面环境。或者也有一些人使用 Fedora Linux 有特定的需求，但不想被系统配置和应用安装所困扰。甚至有些人想根据自己的需要自由安装 Fedora Linux。因此 Fedora Linux 根据你的需要提供了多个版本。本文将介绍不同的 Fedora Linux 版本。\n\r\nFedora 官方版本\n\r\n我们从 Fedora Linux 的 官方版本Edition 开始，即 Fedora Workstation、Fedora Server 和 Fedora IoT。 Fedora Workstation 是 Fedora Linux 的官方版本，可以安装在笔记本电脑和台式电脑上。此版本附带 GNOME 作为默认桌面环境和各种标准应用，因此 Fedora Linux 已为日常使用做好准备。而 Fedora Server 专门用于服务器用途，提供邮件服务器、DNS 等的安装。最后一个是 Fedora IoT，用于物联网和边缘设备生态系统。\n\r\n在 Fedora 项目网站主页上，你可以找到另外两个版本：Fedora CoreOS 和 Fedora Silverblue。Fedora CoreOS 是一个自动更新的操作系统，旨在安全、大规模地运行容器化工作负载。而 Fedora Silverblue 是一个不可变的桌面操作系统，旨在支持以容器为中心的工作流。\n\r\n\n\r\n更多信息可在此链接获得：\n\r\n\r\nhttps://getfedora.org/\n\r\n\r\nFedora 定制版：可选桌面\n\r\nFedora 定制版Spin 很受那些非常在意桌面…",

          "description": "这个周末又被封在家里了，去不了咖啡厅工作，客厅里唯一的办公位被麦嫂占领，两个孩子也很无聊，跑老跑去不得消停。于是，我也选择躺平了，一天睡两觉，醒了就刷视频、看电影。但偶尔又会想起公司的事；疫情各地物流受阻，电商收入又要受到影响；定好的品牌视频拍摄，可能又要因为疫情而延期；想着想着，心中又开始焦虑了，就这样在躺平、焦虑，焦虑、躺平之间反反复复，心情更差了。\n其实回头想想，在整个创业过程中，这点焦虑都属于家常便饭，但大部分人可能会困在焦虑之中，难以自拔。今天就聊聊我曾经最焦虑的几个阶段，也许能给大家一点参考吧。\n2015 年，为了公司业务转型，我开始尝试寻找投资人。性格内向且缺乏经验的我，除了要面对外部的各种质疑，还有应对内部的复杂关系，老股东该如何安顿？合伙人该怎样分配？每一次谈话，每一次邮件发出之后，都会让我无比焦虑。那段时间，我经常无意识的在街上暴走，或者去海边呐喊宣泄，情绪一直处于过山车状态，非常抑郁。直到融资搞定之后，我安排的第一件事是去医院做了全面体检，特别担心身体会出现大问题。\n焦虑归焦虑，真正解决问题的方法，还是要不停的尝试，通过理性沟通处理各方的诉求，该留的留，该走的走。突破自己原有的圈层，放开性格包袱，去寻找更多的可能性。所以，最终的融资不是来自投资公司，而是来自客户、同行和用户。\n2017 年，迎来了又一次创业考验，好不容易融到的一点钱，很快就花完了，马上就要进入发不出工资的窘境。现在想想其实也怪自己，拿到投资的一年时间里，过度的沉醉于资本市场逻辑当中，把大部分精力放在 BP 故事里，忽略了公司管理和业务聚焦，且一度自我感觉良好。\n此刻摆在眼前只有两条路：要么想尽一切办法支撑下去，要么选择清算并关闭公司。但这两条路都很难。不能再指望外人援助，靠自己就只能抵押房子，一旦失败，全家归零。想想已经积累数年的内容、用户、品牌，如果选择结束，也很难再有这样的机会了。何况我们确实做着正确且有价值的事情，只是我们还没有掌握更好的商业模式。\n一边筹措资金，一边送走部分团队，一边重新走出去约见客户。让客户了解我们的内在价值，哪怕是很小的客户，哪怕没有预算也无所谓，做好服务，以真诚换真诚。因为有前面的积累，加上团队的努力，半年之后，公司就能自己运转了。\n2020 年，公司业务已经稳定了，且略有盈余，我也终于还完了大部分贷款，总算可以轻装上阵。没想到春节刚过，新冠疫情全面爆发，全体成员隔离在家。刚刚起步的电商业务，直接就休克，客户拜访计划也全都暂停。说内心不慌是不可能的，焦虑情绪也开始了，但天灾面前，似乎也没什么办法。\n既然公司业务上没办法，就做点力所能及的事吧。无意间在工作群里发现了疫况小程序，可以通过地图定位周边疫情风险，我仔细研究发现是之前认识的开发者做的，聊天一问才知道，他也正在发愁中，数据录入、服务器压力，马上就撑不住了。于是我立刻动员了产品开发团队，参与到这个小程序的支持中，重构界面、扩容服务器、招募数据志愿者、紧急制作疫情科普防护内容，每天熬十几个小时，连续一周，竟然把这个小服务提供给三千万人。\n这段时间的无偿投入，虽然没有多少商业收益，却让更多人知道了少数派的存在，展现了团队的价值观，也间接验证了优质内容的多重价值。\n经过这些事情之后，我个人的抗焦虑能力算是大幅提升，并且也建立了应对原则。人非圣贤，孰能无虑，适当的放低预期，知足常乐。另一方面，既然焦虑不可避免，就不要轻易放弃思考和行动。要知道宏观环境下，很多问题都是阶段性和周期性的，它总会过去或者从头再来，但你的人生经历只有一次，你的行动将决定自己未来的走向。不管有多焦虑，都应该先选择承担起当下的责任，因为转机就发生在这个过程之中。\n换个角度来看，这世界上还有很多人，正在面对着各种生存、病痛、离别、各种不可逆转的人生变故，他们可能都还没有焦虑的机会，相对来说，我们依然属于幸运的多数派了。",

          "description": "7 月 29 日，Beyoncé 发布了时隔六年的录音室专辑 Renaissance。Beyoncé 在这张专辑以电子舞曲为底色，探讨了关于性别、种族、接纳与和解的议题。自发布起，这张专辑也获得了乐评与听众的广泛好评，除了到现在还没有发正经 MV 这件事1。\n除去对社会议题与个人议题的人文关怀，这张专辑一个极大的特点就是「听感流畅」，在保持专辑主题内涵一致的前提下，歌曲与歌曲之间衔接自然，节奏的变化与旋律的流动没有带来割裂。如果你在 Apple Music 或其他支持「无缝播放」的平台按顺序播放整张专辑，会发现在大部分时间，你甚至无法听出两首歌之间的区隔，上一首歌最末的点题同时成为下一首歌的引子。而这正是我们今天的主题：无缝播放、segue 与概念专辑。\n \n在数字音乐之前的年代，无缝播放（gapless playback）根本算不上一个值得单独拿出来的概念。当一张黑胶唱片或磁带被灌录好，送到消费者手上时，往往也是像灌录的过程一样，从头开始一直播放到底的。专辑的封底或是歌词本可能会标注不同歌曲时长或所在的时间点，但整个播放的过程是连贯的。\n这样的播放习惯与介质特性给了一些擅长以概念构建专辑的艺术家机会。其中最典型的就是 Pink Floyd 乐队的「摇滚歌剧」专辑《The Wall》，与围绕时间、死亡和精神疾病的《The Dark Side of the Moon》。这支乐队非常明显的特征，就是专辑中常常毫无断点或停顿。其中，后者甚至在灌录之前，先行在剧场不间断地演出完四十余分钟的全长，如同一出无法停止的舞台剧；唱片则为未能到达剧场的听众带去同样的连贯体验，随着音乐进行感受唱片中讲述的孤独、恐惧与对现实的嘲讽。这种处理方式就被称作「segue」，直译作「无间断地从一段（音乐或场景）自然转向另一段」，在模拟音乐时代，甚至绝大多数的 CD 中，这是一件非常自然的事，因为音乐就是…",

So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.\n\n3x3 可以轻松的记录日常的时间线，可以关联每日、周、月、年、甚至人生的待办或者标签，并且待办之间可以进行双向链接\n做3x3的想法就是，过了很多年之后，我还可以方便的找到当天做过有意义的事情\n然后可以将所有事情串联起来，比如我学习一样事情，阅读一本书，可以清晰的知道每个阶段的过程，甚至你可以制作你自己的10000小时计划\n3x3 的设计想法在 2018 年初，就有了，当时我还做了一个简单的网页，它…",

          "description": "在 WWDC22 上，Apple 发布 iOS 16 的时候，公布了一个功能叫实时活动，并向开发者开放 Live Activities API。\n\n那么什么实时活动呢？\n实时活动是一种新的交互式消息通知，用户可以在 iPhone 的锁屏界面看到事件的实时更新。比如球赛的比分、打车或订餐的订单状态、运动锻炼的实时数据等。这种消息通知形式允许开发者在实时活动期间更新单个交互式通知，而不是每次有状态更新时都发送新通知。通过减少发送的通知数量，同时使信息更易于访问。\nUber海外版团队设计的实时活动界面\nApple 在 iOS 16 开发者测试版 Beta 4 首次向开发者提供 ActivityKit 开发套件，首次在真机实装，随后在 Beta 6 和 Beta 7 并没有在真机实装实时活动功能。开发者目前只能在模拟器测试这项功能，或者降级回 Beta 4 或 Beta 5。Apple 在开发者网站也明确表示实时活动不会在首个 iOS16 正式版推出，而是在今年晚些时候的正式版突出。下图是模仿目前已有的原神安卓小组件、iOS 小组件做的实时活动版小组件。到了 8 月 16 日一大早用手机更新 Beta 6 之后，手机就不能运行和测试实时活动了，随后也看到其他开发者反馈实时活动在 Beta 6 版本没有实装。本文后面的截图只能在模拟器截取了，但模拟器不能更改壁纸，只有黑色背景。\nXcode真机调试报错ActivityKit没实装\n实时活动界面部分是小组件扩展，开发者使用 WidgetKit 功能和 SwiftUI 编写界面布局，ActivityKit 是处理配置、启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动是一种消息通知，是一种可以自定义界面布局和更新状态的消息通知。下图是普通类型的消息通知，或许以后能看到换了界面布局的降雨提醒。\n普通的消息通知类型\n实时活动要求和限制\n与小组件不同的是，小组件是通过时间线机制更新界面数据，实时活动是通过远程推送或 ActivityKit 从主应用程序来启动、更新和结束实时活动。实时活动无法访问网络或接收位置更新，下图网络请求图片失败。\n\nActivityKit 更新和远程推送通知更新的更新动态数据大小不能超过 4KB。\n实时活动界面不能包含可交互元素，例如按钮和 WebView。当用户点击实时活动界面，将会打开主应用程序。\n自定义实时活动的用户界面时，系统会忽略任何自定义动画，但可以使用系统自带的时间文本动画，当实时活动的动态内容发生变化时，系统会执行一些动画。文本视图通过模糊的内容过渡动画内容变化，系统为图像和 SF Symbols 符号动画内容过渡，根据内容或状态更改从用户界面添加或删除视图，视图会淡入淡出。\n系统自带的时间文本动画系统为图像内容变化作出的动画效果\n在开发者网站的描述中，如果实时活动的高度超过 160，系统可能会截断它。在实际测试中，实时活动界面最小高度为 64，最大高度可以达到 220。目前实时活动功能还不是正式的版本，有可能在之后的测试版本会有改变。\n\n当用户在 App 首次启动时，点击允许应用程序发送通知时，就代表允许 App 发送实时活动通知，不允许则不会收到实时活动的通知。之后在系统设置 - 对应的 App -实时活动，可以关闭/开启实时活动权限。\n实时活动权限位置\n实时活动有 4 种活动状态，分别是：等待中、正在进行、成功、失败\n实时活动在锁屏界面显示的时候，用户可以左划，点击清除按钮将其清除。用户没有清除的情况下，实时活动最多可以处于活动状态 8 小时，如果用户或应用程序尚未结束活动状态，系统会自动结束它。在此结束状态下，实时活动会在锁定屏幕上最多保留 4 个小时，最后系统会将其删除。\n\n目前实时活动功能还在测试状态，开发者们还在为他们的 App 设计和测试这一项功能，下图是收集几款目前在测试中的实时活动的例子。\n一些例子展示\n关于实时活动这一功能的一些设想。在这个功能正式上线后，除了官方和大部分媒体提到的比赛比分、运动训练状态、行程状态、订单状态等这些功能以外，我们或许还可以看到这些功能：某餐饮 App 提醒你周四中午吃啥；原神体力、宝钱、参量质变仪到点提示上线领取；购物平台推送提醒商品抢购即将开启、正在抢购还剩余 69 件并且在不断减少等之类的功能。\n\n以上就是关于实时活动这个功能的一些介绍和想法。之前的一篇锁屏天气的文章和视频会有评论说解锁在桌面小组件就能看到天气了啊，左划负一屏添加小组件就能看到天气了啊。不过对于我这种手机懒得解锁的用户来说，对于锁屏实时活动这个功能是非常期待的。大家对于实时活动这个系统特性及功能有什么想法和期待呢？",

          "description": "Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nSony is rolling out a new PS5 system software update that includes 1440p resolution support, a new gamelists feature, and UX and social improvements. Testing for 1440p on PS5 first started in July, and now all PS5 owners will be able to access the software update.\nThe new 1440p option allows PS5 owners to pick this resolution on compatible TVs and monitors. If games fully support 1440p then they’ll natively output at this resolution, otherwise 4K games will improve anti-aliasing by using supersampling down to 1440p output. The only drawback is that Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) won’t be supported at 1440p, and will only work at 1080p and 4K on the PS5.\nThis new PS5 update also includes a gamelists feature, which is essentially folders for...\nContinue reading…",

          "description": "The new PS5 (1200) internals. | Image: Austin Evans (YouTube)\n    \n\n  \nSony has totally revamped the internal design of its latest PS5 models. A revised PS5 model started appearing in Australia last month, and now YouTuber Austin Evans has taken a look at the internals and discovered a lot of changes. Sony is using a new, smaller motherboard for the PS5, different cooling, and has even changed the SSD enclosure.\nAll of these changes add up to another weight reduction, but no obvious changes to the exterior of the PS5. The real big change is the updated motherboard in the PS5. It has shrunk by around two inches, and the cooling for the PS5 is slightly different thanks to an additional heat pipe at the rear and a smaller heatsink.\n\n\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve seen a redesigned cooling solution on the PS5....\nContinue reading…",

That’s because Sonos makes speakers that — more often than not — boast great sound quality, support for all the major streaming platforms, and simple multi-room functionality. Unfortunately, however, those perks often come at a high price. Sonos products aren’t cheap, and, outside of the occasional rogue discount, they rarely go on sale. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean there aren’t ways to save at least a few dollars on Sonos gear.\n\n\nIf you’re comfortable buying refurbished, for example, you could save a decent amount.

The Merge is arguably one of the most anticipated events yet in cryptocurrency history, when the Ethereum blockchain will switch from a disturbingly energy-hungry method of validating transactions to a new strategy that uses a fraction of the electricity as the network gobbled up before. \nThe transition is supposed to slash Ethereum’s energy consumption by a whopping 99.95 percent.
