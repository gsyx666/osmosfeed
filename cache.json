Previously, both frameworks had React-like rendering strategies. Now, they will have a rendering strategy more similar to SolidJS, with signals feeding precise updates into the DOM, with no need for components to rerender. This is what enables SolidJS to have performance almost as fast as imperative vanilla JS.\nHowever, if you're used to React, it's easy to focus too much on the performance aspect, and miss the real point of reactivity: better code organization. We could always directly update DOM nodes in event handlers if we were just trying to achieve optimal performance. But reactivity increases developer productivity by all…",

Don’t keep secrets in an environment variable\nIt's a good practice to have your objects use a secret in an environment variable since other parts of your system can access environment variables.

          "description": "It has been almost 4 weeks since I started developing palpatine. In this week I have added couple more features to support markdown files. If you missed the first post on palpatine, you can read it here. The static site generator I am building is a real world tool, so I want to make it efficient and my goal is to help users find information they need as quickly as possible. Palpatine now supports horizontal rule and inline code features to help you compose your interactive documentation with ease. See the demo with the new markdown features.\nRegarding the features I stated above, I initially filed separate issues Issue #9 and issue #10 and created separate branches for each feature. There are couple ways I know to create branches through terminal. One of them is;\n  git branch <branch-name> # creates a new branch\n  git checkout <branch-name> # switches to the new branch\n\nThis is the way I used to create branches. But I found out that there is a better way to create branches and switch to them in one command. The command is;\n  git checkout -b issue-10\n\nThis command little bit more efficient compared to the previous one. It creates a new branch and switches to it in one command. \nAfter I finished  the features, I merged the branches to the  main branch. I used the following command to merge the branches to the master branch;\n  git merge issue-10\n\nThe fun part was watching all changes from the different branches merge to the main branch. I achieved this smoothly without crashing any part of the code. I did not have any merge conflicts this time as I was careful about what I was changing and merging. \n\n\n\nIssue\nClosed by\n\n\n\n\nIssue #9\n2296034\n\n\nIssue #10\n37d8c11",

Eisenhower 的一句话。画一个水平和垂直分割的方框。在列上标明“紧急”和“不紧急”，在行上标明“重要”和“不重要”。\n\r\n\n\r\n一个艾森豪威尔矩阵。（Kevin Sonney, CC BY-SA 4.0）\n\r\n你可以把待办事项上的任务放在其中一个框里。但如何知道一个任务应该放在哪里？紧迫性和重要性往往是主观的。因此，第一步就是决定什么对你来说是重要的。我的家庭（包括宠物）、工作和爱好都很重要。如果待办事项上的东西与这三件事无关，我可以立即把它放到 “不重要” 行。\n\r\n紧迫性是一个比较简单的问题。一件事需要在今天或明天完成吗？那么它可能是 “紧急的”。一件事是否有一个即将到来的最后期限，但离那个时间还有几天/几周/几个月，或者它根本就没有最后期限？当然是 “不急的”。\n\r\n现在我们可以将这些框转化为优先级。“紧急/重要” 是最高优先级（即第一优先级），需要首先完成。接下来是 “不紧急/重要”（优先级 2），然后是 “紧急/不重要”（优先级 3），最后是 “不紧急/不重要”（优先级 4 或根本没有优先级）。\n\r\n请注意，“紧急/不重要” 是第三位，而不是第二位。这是因为，人们花了很多时间在那些看似重要的事情上，只是因为它们比较紧急，实际上这些事并不是重要的。当我看到这类事项时，我会问自己一些问题。这些任务需要我具体完成吗？这些任务我可以要求其他人去做吗？它们对其他人来说是否重要和紧急？而这是否改变了它们对我的重要性？也许它们需要重新分类，或者我可以要求别人完成，并将它们从我的清单中删除。\n\r\n\n\r\n确定优先级后。（Kevin Sonney, CC BY-SA 4.0）\n\r\n对于“不紧急/不重要”框中的事项，有一个问题要问，那就是 “这些事情到底需不需要放在我的清单上？”说实话，我们经常用那些不紧急或不重要的事情来填满待办事项清单，但其实完全可以将它们从清单上删除。我知道承认 “这事永远不会完成” 是很难的，但在接受这个事实后，把这个事情从清单上删除并且不用再为它担心，是一种解脱。\n\r\n经过这一切，看着清单很容易说出：“这是我现在需要做的事情。” 然后完成它。这就是待办事项的作用：为一天提供指导和重点。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/21/1/prioritize-tasks\n\r\n作者：Kevin Sonney 选题：lujun9972 译者：Veryzzj 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Audacity 的新更新带来了一些重要功能，例如 VST3 插件支持和新效果按钮。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nAudacity 3.2 来了，这是这个最流行的自由开源音频编辑和录制工具之一的小版本更新。\n\r\n此版本是在之前的主要版本 Audacity 3.0 发布一年多之后发布的。\n\r\n即使在去年引起争议 之后，它仍然是目前最好的 Linux 音频编辑器之一。\n\r\n此版本有许多新增功能，例如对VST3 插件的支持、对 Apple 芯片、FFMPEG 5.0 的支持等等。\n\r\n让我们快速了解一下 Audacity 的新功能。\n\r\nAudacity 3.2：有什么新功能？\n\r\n这是一个小版本更新，带来了重大的变化和补充。\n\r\n一些主要亮点包括：\n\r\n\r\n支持 VST3 插件。\n\r\nApple 芯片支持。\n\r\nFFMPEG 5.0。\n\r\nVST3、LV2、音频单元和 LADSPA 的实时功能。\n\r\n用于实时效果的专用按钮。\n\r\n删除对 Linux 系统的 JACK 要求。\n\r\n对用户界面的各种调整。\n\r\n\r\n新的效果按钮\n\r\n\n\r\nAudacity 的界面中添加了一个专用的实时效果按钮，使用户可以轻松地即时下载和应用效果。\n\r\n你可以访问官方维基 了解有关此功能的更多信息。\n\r\nVST3 插件支持\n\r\nAudacity 3.2 还引入了对 VST3 插件的支持，这使用户能够利用 VST3 的高级音频处理功能，包括高效利用 CPU、更好地处理 MIDI、支持 MIDI I/O 等等。\n\r\n将音频上传到云端\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Audacity 中加入的另一个令人兴奋的功能是，可以选择直接从应用程序中分享音频到 Audacity 的新云音频平台 audio.com。\n\r\nFFMPEG 5.0\n\r\nAudacity 现在也支持了 FFMPEG 5.0；这确保了用户可以利用最新的开源音频/视频库套件。\n\r\n苹果芯片支持\n\r\n此版本还为基于 arm64 架构的 Apple 芯片带来了 macOS 支持。\n\r\n下载 Audacity 3.2\n\r\n你可以通过其官方网站、GitHub 发布区、Flathub 或 Snap 下载最新的 Audacity 版本。\n\r\n\r\nAudacity 3.2 下载\n\r\n\r\n💬 你会尝试 Audacity 3.2 吗？我认为对VST3插件的支持应该是一个改变游戏规则的因素，你怎么看？在下面的评论部分分享它！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/audacity-3-2-release/\n\r\n作者：Sourav Rudra 选题：lkxed 译者：littlebirdnest 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "在正式开始教程之前首先说明一下目前国行系统的状态：最新版三星云（5.2.00.5）屏蔽了OneDrive备份的入口，直接删除了相关备份软件的服务。因此要在国行系统机器上继续使用OneDrive备份需要降级三星云。如果对Samsung Pay没有需求而对同步有比较大的需求，最简单的方法是刷港版系统。本教程基于One UI 4.1，国行S20。所有需要的安装包均可在教程链接或者apkmirror网站上找到。\n在开始之前需要的准备：一个非大陆地区的三星账号，一个微软账号（需要是个人账号），一个非国行系统的三星手机（也可以是你的国行设备刷港版系统），以及一部国行系统的三星手机（操作对象）。\n第一步，绑定三星账号和微软账户。\n在非国行系统的手机上登录三星账号，然后在相册的设置里，找到云同步，点击按照提示登录微软账户。其中某些步骤容易因为网络原因卡住，不过由于我从来没遇到过，所以有需求的建议在酷安上搜索相关资料，或者全程科学网络。这一步很简单，因此不做过多阐述。\n第二步，降级三星云。\n一般来说，国行系统的三星云会被强制自动更新，因此要想使用备份需要先降级三星云。\n目前在apkmirror上找到能安装也能备份的最新版是5.1.00.13，由于版本号相比国行最新版三星云5.1.05.9更低，需要重新安装。可以现在系统里卸载三星云，再安装此版本的三星云。如果不想重新同步之前的云数据，可以使用ADB直接降级安装。代码我放在下面（为了方便输入，包名我改成了123.apk）\nadb install -r -d D:\\123.apk\n第三步，在国行设备上进行后续操作。\n登录账号之后，下载一个OneDrive，登录之前和三星账户绑定的那个微软账户。登录成功之后就可以暂时忽略这个软件。然后按照链接里的方法在手机上安装lycan，这一步是关键，否则之后的操作都无法进行。\nhttps://www.coolapk.com/feed/32708070?shareKey=YWUwNDI3ZTU5Y2FmNjMzMTVlN2M~&shareUid=964712&shareFrom=com.coolapk.app_5.0.2\n下载「创建快捷方式」这个软件\n【创建快捷方式】 ，打开之后右上角三个点勾选「也显示系统应用」，搜索三星云。点击进入三星云的活动列表，搜索「dashboard」，找到图中这个活动，然后创建一个快捷方式放在桌面。\n\n如果此时打开这个快捷方式，会进入OneDrive同步的那个页面，但是会提示三星云需要更新才能同步，如果不更新就会强制退出。所以我们需要用到lycan屏蔽这个更新提示。\n打开lycan，搜索三星云，在「服务」中将uploadtodrive两项设置成enable\n\n在「接收器」中将下图三项禁用，三项名字均带有update\n\n在「服务」中打开下图两项\n\n此时重新打开刚刚那个快捷方式，就能够正常同步了。\n成功效果如图\n\n如果之后打开三星云又提示更新，可以按照之前的方法降级三星云。不排除之后的系统更新会屏蔽这个接口的可能，只能说且用且珍惜。",

          "description": "时间切片 Time Slice 是延时摄影的静态表现形式：你通过固定机位并在特定的时间间隔内拍摄一系列照片，得到一组静态照片，然后在后期的时候按照时间顺序，取每一张照片的局部，然后拼接起来，便得到一个名为时间切片的照片。\n2022 年 7 月份在梧桐山顶拍摄了一组日落时分的延时照片，并在后期导入电脑并使用 DaVinci Resolve 合成延时视频的时候，我突然想起一个朋友在 2013 年输出的一个时间切片照片。于是也想给我这组照片制作一个时间切片。\n后期制作时间切片是一道很复杂的工程（比如，可以参考这里），随着照片数目的增多，操作步骤会越多。在正式使用 Photoshop 尝试制作时间切片之前，我就直接有个想法，要不自己实现一把？\n事实上，使用程序来实现一点都不难：给一组照片排好序后，在一个大的画布上，依次取该照片特定的区域，然后绘制到该画布的同样的区域就能实现这种效果。最开始我是在 Android 上进行这块的测试，后来很快就完成并验证了效果的可用性。后来想了下，MyerTidy 虽然目前的功能只有「整理文件」，但它实际上是可以定位为一个「批量处理」的 app。\n最后便有了 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新（暂时只有 macOS 版本）。\n此版本带来以下的变化：\n\n重新设计的带响应式布局的首页，为未来支持更多批量操作进行前置的支持\n新增各个模式的功能介绍以及效果图\n支持「延时切片」功能，正如上文所说的，可以为你制作时间切片照片。在下文会做更详细的介绍\n进行了小部分重构和性能优化\n\n在首页选择了「延时切片」后，你便可以选择一个文件夹或者一组照片了，之后会自动进行预览渲染：\n\n \n默认的效果是，根据你的文件名升序排序，从左到右，不对图片进行采样来进行绘制。\n比如你有文件名为 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg 到 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg 的 100 张图片，会使用以下顺序从左到右来绘制：\n\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_002.jpg\n…\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg\n\n效果如上。\n \n你可以点击「倒序处理」，来使用倒序的方式来从左到右绘制：\n\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_099.jpg\n…\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg\n\n效果如下：\n\n \n如果你觉得你的图片太多了，想以固定的间隔来取一部分来绘制，那么可以在「跳过合成的数目」来输入你要跳过的数目 X。也就是，每隔 X 张，只会取一张来绘制。\n\n跳过的数目为 5 的情况下，每 5 张会选择第一张来绘制。\n对于上述图片，跳过数目设定为 50 的时候（原图片总数目为 654 张）效果如下：\n\n \n最后，上述的布局方式都是「水平布局」：图片以水平方向来进行绘制。\n你可以点击「垂直布局」，来开启从上到下的绘制模式，效果如下：\n\n此外特别注意的一点是，MyerTidy 目前不支持图片自动对齐。因此如果你的图片组因为前期拍摄的原因有部分图片对不齐，那么需要你先使用 Photoshop 等工具来前期做对齐（当然，相比做时间切片来说，应该不算太困难）。如果需求强烈，那么可能会调研并加入这块的支持。\n以上便是 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新。未来会专注 macOS 下对文件和图片的「批处理」的实现，目前期望会做的下一个大功能便是对文件按照特定的规则批量重命名（比如整理番剧之类的，会很有用），也在思考是否可以加入类似「星轨合成」这样的功能。\n你可以通过 App Store 搜索 MyerTidy 来进行下载。如果你有什么想法和反馈，欢迎留言。",
