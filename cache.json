          "description": "Apache Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. Based on the concept of a Project Object Model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central piece of information.\nMaven’s primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. Maven adheres to the principle of \"convention over configuration\" that helps building Maven projects with very little configuration. Systems, libraries, and frameworks should assume reasonable defaults, and systems should \"just work\" without requiring unnecessary configuration. In order to attain this goal, there are several areas of concern that Maven attempts to deal with:\nMaking the build process easy\nProviding a uniform build system\nProviding quality project information\nProviding guidelines for best practices development\nAllowing transparent migration to new features\nThe configuration of a Maven project is done by creating a file called pom.xml located at the root of the project. This file is referred to as the POM file. Each POM file inherits from a global Super POM that defined common properties for all Maven projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  More information\n\n\n\n\nMaven Releases History, with documentation\nApache Maven Wikipedia Article\nBetter Builds with Maven\nSonatype eBooks",

But to understand why Rossum is so helpful, let’s first dive into the problems you’ll frequently run into with traditional OCR tools.\nConsider the sheer variety of invoices we receive on a daily basis:\n\nIn these invoice PDF snippets, the fields indicating the total amount due are very different from one another.

In ES6 we have a new way to work with objects, which is called object destruction.\nLet's see an example:\nconst person = {\n  name: \"Hasan\",\n  age: 30,\n  city: \"Cairo\",\n};\n\nconst { name, age, city } = person;\n\nconsole.log(name); // Hasan\n\nHere we defined an object called person, that object contains three properties, name, age, and city. Then we used object destruction to get the values of those properties and store them in variables with the same names.\nWe can also use object destruction to get the values of properties and store them in variables with different names.\nconst person = {\n  name: \"Hasan\",\n  age: 30,\n  city: \"Cai…",

          "description": "印象笔记被出售\n\r\n意大利移动应用开发商 Bending Spoons 公司今天宣布收购印象笔记（Evernote）。在收购的新闻稿中说，“印象笔记拥有约 1 亿美元的经常性收入，数百万付费客户，以及使用其跨平台应用程序创建的近 110 亿条笔记。”印象笔记曾经是最流行的笔记应用之一，但在 2016 年开始限制免费用户的使用。在同一年还宣布开发了可以审查用户笔记的 AI，以及让其员工可以访问用户笔记，虽然在招致巨大反对后取消了计划，但也导致了大量用户流失。如今，在 iOS 上，它甚至没有跻身生产力应用程序的前 100 名。收购宣告没有公开收购金额等细节。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这个曾经兴盛一时的应用，也算是画上了一个逗号，或者，句号。还有人在用它吗？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nAlmaLinux 9.1 紧随 RHEL 9.1 发布\n\r\n红帽企业 Linux（RHEL）9.1 今天正式发布，RHEL 9.1 将 PHP 8.1 作为支持的应用流，扩展了多级安全支持，支持将容器嵌入到镜像构建器蓝图中等等一系列更新增强。而仅仅半天后，作为 RHEL 9.1 的自由构建版本，AlmaLinux 9.1 就发布了。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我觉得 CentOS 的结束至少有一个好处，RHEL 的自由版本发布的更快了，以前都需要几周。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nKDE 宣布新的社区目标：可访问性、环境可持续性、自动化\n\r\n在今年的 KDE 年度开发者大会上，KDE 宣布了新的社区目标。他们希望把重点放在确保 KDE 软件对所有人都是无障碍的。之前的 KDE 社区目标是围绕着一致性、对 KDE 应用程序的关注和 Wayland 支持。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我还是觉得之前的目标更务实一些，目前的 KDE 虽然已经很棒了，但是距离最好还有一些距离。\n\r\n\r\n回音\n\r\n\r\nFedora Linux 获准 进行现代 C 语言的 移植工作，这些变化包括删除隐式函数声明、删除隐式整型、删除旧式函数声明等不符合 C99 规范的部分。",

          "description": "虽然现在多屏用户逐渐变多，但仍是小众，Windows 也并没过对多屏使用进行太多的优化。所以只好自己动手，于是有了以下一些个人自用的优化设置。\n窗口出现位置优化\nWindows 系统仅对多屏用户提供了简单主显示器的设置，默认情况下所有新打开的窗口都只会出现在主显示器上，即使你在使用另一个的显示器。而「基于显示器连接记住窗口位置」只能记住上次关闭时所在的屏幕，实用性并不高。\n\n这时微软自家的 Power Toys 里的 FancyZones 就可以派上用场了，除了我们熟知的窗口布局设置外，它还可以调整窗口行为，在这里我们可以通过启用「将新创建的窗口移动到当前 活动的监视器（实验性）」来达到这一效果，美中不足的是动画不够优雅。\n\n窗口出现的问题解决了，但任务栏上默认是显示所有屏幕上的窗口，不能让我们快速区分哪些应用是在当前屏幕下的。\n\n为了解决该问题，如下图所示，Windows 提供了简陋的选项加让人摸不着头脑的翻译。设置后，每个屏幕下的任务栏就只显示当前屏幕下打开的窗口，更符合直觉，不过 Win + 数字 的快捷键就只能在主显示器上使用了。\n\n内容显示优化\n现在 Windows 下大部分的应用都适配高 DPI 的，少部分不支持的，也可以通过 Windows 自带的属性 - 兼容性选项来调整。\n\n上面的设置仅解决了单个应用在高分辨率屏幕下的问题，并不能解决应用在分辨率相差太大的显示器间移动时会出现界面变形问题。这时，如果你使用的 AMD 显卡，那你可以通过启用 AMD Radeon Software 里的「超虚拟分辨率」来让低分辨率屏切换到更高的逻辑分辨率，不仅缩小的多屏间的分辨率差距，还有抗锯齿的效果。由于个人没有使用 Nvidia 和 Intel 显卡，相关选项是否存在请自行到显卡设置里翻找。\n\n设置完成后到 Windows 设置调整下逻辑分辨率和缩放即可。\n\n除此之外，对于我们网上冲浪必备的浏览器，它的缩放是固定的，且只有一个设置选项。不知道有没有人跟我一样两个屏幕的缩放比例是不一样的，在两个屏幕间移动浏览器时，网页内容并不会根据 DPI 而变化，导致观感割裂。在这里我推荐一个 FireFox 浏览器插件：ffreszoom，它可以实时感知屏幕宽度的变化，当宽度超过指定值时，自动调整到指定缩放比例。设置前先通过这个网站查看自己的屏幕宽度：http://whatismyscreenresolution.net/，需要将 Firefox 浏览器移动到不同显示器上刷新。\n\n如图所示我的外屏宽度是 1728 px，笔记本内屏为 1024，所以我在两者之间随意取了一个值用于判断，若当前屏幕宽度超过 1600 px，就自动设置缩放为 1.5，也即 150%。若小于 1600 px，则使用浏览器设置里的值。两种缩放无缝切换，只会多了一个缩放的动画。由于本人没使用 Chromium 类浏览器，并没有对应的插件推荐，不过其用户这么多，应该会有类似的插件。\n\n利用「闲置的」触摸板\n不知有没有跟我一样喜欢使用笔记本键盘的，且平时一些简单的操作直接用触摸板直接操作。现在 Windows 11 已经支持自定义触摸板多指手势了，但其不能根据不同应用设置不同的手势，例如：A 软件可以用 Ctrl  + W 关闭，但 B 软件只能用 Alt + F4，同一个操作有不同的快捷键。\n\n这时就需要第三方软件了，这里我推荐 GestureSign，界面虽然是 Windows 10 风格，但不影响使用，毕竟设置完就不用再看了。它可以为不同应用的不同快捷键键设置相同的触控手势，手势类型也不再仅限于横平竖直，可以自由发挥。同时软件也内置了一些常用的命令供选择。\n\n上图是我的一些设置，双指一般使用系统默认就不添加上去了。其中个人最爱的是三指滑动切换标签，体验比鼠标点击更加符合人的直觉。对于频繁使用搜索启动器的我，把三指上滑指定为搜索启动器的快捷键，方便呼出。\n \n对了，设置前记得把系统自带的相关手势取消掉，不然会冲突。若你仍不习惯使用触摸板，该软件也支持鼠标手势，具体可以自行下载体验。\n结尾\n以上便是我在使用多屏时遇到的问题，及相关解决方法，希望对多屏用户有帮助。",

          "description": "作为一名iPhone用户，快捷指令是系统中我觉得很有趣但实际上用得不是很多的应用。\n最初对快捷指令的理解仅限于将多个操作步骤简化成一个，最直观的应用就是在功能日益繁杂的APP中实现功能的一键直达，比如疫情期间的健康码。\n但深入探究一番后，我认为快捷指令的本质其实是打破各个APP沙盒的壁垒，实现不同应用程序的能力互通，提升个人的自动化水平。\n但事情情况并不尽如人意，虽然快捷指令编辑器提供了足够强大的编辑器，但三方应用对其支持并不好，大多数APP还是尽可能期望把用户圈在自己的生态中，没有开放足够的能力出来，这也是一款生态级应用的无奈。\n想象中的快捷指令\n现在应用商店的APP已经足够多，可以帮助人们解决足够多的问题，但有时候一款应用并不能完全解决某项任务，需要多个应用配合操作，如果用户可以随意调用应用中功能并组合成自己所需要完成特定任务的能力，那么用户体验和效率都将提升到新的高度。\n想象一种场景，当我在观看自己感兴趣的外语视频时，因为语言的障碍可能不能足够理解视频内容，我需要一些辅助支持：我希望翻译软件能够帮我把外语翻译成母语，甚至希望语音合成软件将翻译后的语言读出来。孤立地看这个场景中的每个需求，都有应用能很好得实现：视频网站能够提供我感兴趣的内容，翻译软件能将语言进行较高准确度的翻译，语音合成软件能够将文字朗读出来。但是当这三个需求点分布在三个不同的APP时，用户就难以较高效率完成这个场景的任务。实际上每个APP的能力都被封锁在了自己APP里面。\n\n上面说的这个场景我自己就有，但是因为没能使用现有工具很好使用，只得自己动手做了一个插件，可以朗读B站上面带有字幕的视频，因为微软的中文语音合成做得比较好，所以先放在Edge浏览器上了，目前还只支持带外挂字幕的视频，大家感兴趣也可以使用。\n\nB站视频字幕朗读（中文同传）插件地址-> Microsoft Edge Addons\n现实中的快捷指令\n虽然当前快捷指令还不够优秀，但对于日常效率的提升还是有一定帮助的，特别是对于实现与苹果自带应用的互通。\n举个使用的例子，每天早上我会用笔记软件记录一下昨日回顾、思考以及今日的计划，对于今日计划，我希望用待办应用去跟踪计划中事项的状态，但是手动把写过的东西在另一个APP里面再写一遍实在是太过愚蠢，于是我就写了快捷指令去实现。\n\n实际使用中，只要选择对应的文本并在共享表单中点击对应的操作就可以同步到系统自带的提醒事项中，在mac上还可以添加快捷键一键实现（应该还可以通过「自动化」省去手动操作这一步）。\n当前的快捷指令有三个亮点：\n\n在快捷指令的编辑上采用图形化拖拽操作，相对于写脚本，这种操作显得更加友好，并且也可以支持自定义脚本的加入，甚至让我一度觉得学编程的第一个应用是用快捷指令写得；\n在快捷指令的运行上打通了Siri、小组件以及共享操作，特别是后者，为与三方应用的结合提供了基础的平台；\n加入了自动化功能，可以根据一定的规则直接省去了用户主动调用快捷指令这一步。\n\n但要让更多的人在更多场景下使用快捷指令，还有着一些明显的不足：\n\n上手使用上有一些门槛，官方没有详细的教程，虽然提供了一些案例，但是大多数人应该没有耐心仔细去看快捷中心中那些精选的指令是如何实现的，这点Mac上快捷指令前辈「自动操作」可能给点其启示，其中「录制」功能可以通过「我做给你看」自动识别操作中的事件；\n快捷指令的分发做得还不够，既然不是每个人都能轻松使用快捷指令，那么获取现成的快捷指令则更加重要，但快捷指令中心中精选的指令本土化、个性化做得并不好，我觉得如果能根据用户所安装的APP来个性化分发常用的快捷指令会更友好；\n三方应用的能力开放明显不足，大多数的使用场景还是围绕在苹果自带应用提供的能力，这点极大限制了快捷指令的应用场景；\n使用Siri来激活快捷指令时对于指令的识别非常差，官方有说使用快捷指令的名称就可以通过Siri调用，但实际使用时不时语音识别不出来就是调用的指令不正确；\n\n有趣的是，在WWDC2022中，我们看到苹果开始推广App Intent框架，通过为应用开发者提供更多系统级的入口曝光来吸引他们将其应用所能满足的用户意图曝光给系统，从而使得系统可以通过学习用户行为实现跨应用的能力整合。\n结语\n很多人即使生活中充满重复的事情也不会去探索提高效率方式，因为对比眼前简单的操作，去探究增进效率操作的所花费的学习努力带来的成本更加高，只是把时间线拉得足够远，才能看见效率提升所带来收益。\n自动化所存在的意义是帮助人完成任务并节省时间，虽然我们每个人都已经拥有足够多的计算设备，但我们并没有充分发挥其拥有的算力，个人的自动化仍是一个尚待开发的领域。\n期待未来的快捷指令能为个人的自动化增添更多的可能性。",

          "description": "Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nAmazon will be cutting jobs again at some point in early 2023, CEO Andy Jassy informed employees in a memo on Thursday. The company publicly confirmed some layoffs on Wednesday, and Jassy says that as Amazon’s annual planning process extends into the new year, “there will be more role reductions as leaders continue to make adjustments.” \nJassy says the company hasn’t determined exactly how many additional roles will be cut but did state that there will be “reductions in our Stores and [People, Experience, and Technology] organizations.” Amazon will inform who will be impacted by the future cuts early next year. \nIn the Wednesday notice, devices and services SVP Dave Limp said that some staffers in the organization were being laid off,...\nContinue reading…",

According to the company’s statement, the cuts are meant to reduce its “headcount expenses” by around 5 percent as it tries to spend less on operations in the face of “current economic conditions” in the advertising and streaming industry.\nIn some ways, the move isn’t necessarily surprising — several of Roku’s peers, such as Disney, Netflix, and Meta, have also announced layoffs in recent weeks and months. \nHowever, cutting 200 jobs is a much harsher change than the company was predicting just over two weeks ago when it released its Q3 earnings report.

          "description": "getimg.ai, which started as a simple website to generate images with text input. During that time, thanks to fantastic community feedback, it has become a suite of 3 unique AI art tools (with more to come):\n\n\n🪄 AI Editor\n\nA graphics-like editor based on an infinite canvas putting different AI models together in one interface. An advanced and professional tool that can be used for:\n👉🏻 Outpainting → expanding pictures beyond their original borders\n👉🏻 Inpainting → erasing part of an image and filling it with new objects based on a given text\n👉🏻 Text to image → generating images with just text\n👉🏻 Image to image → modifying the style of an image\n👉🏻 Find & Replace → replacing parts of an image using only text, e.g., replace \"t-shirt.\" with a \"suit.\"\n👉🏻 Face enhancement → improving the quality of generated faces\n\n\n📝 Text to Image\n\nSimple interface for generating images with just text. Great start for AI art beginners that offers more advanced users the possibility to play with a set of generation guiding parameters.\n\n\n🖼️ Image to Image\n\nA tool for modifying existing images or generating their variations with text prompts. Best for changing the style of the picture, e.g., \"make this image look like van Gogh painting.\"\n\n______\n\nLet me know what you think! All feedback is appreciated and helpful in shaping the future of getimg.ai!\n\nPS: Get 20% OFF for 3 months of any plan using the code: PH20 (valid until Saturday)\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",

We created Lumos to help people save money and bring more transparency to the US health insurance industry.\n\nProblem Statement\nWhen we both quit our corporate jobs earlier this year and became self-employed, we had to pick our own health insurance using healthcare.gov and only then  realized how difficult it was to pick the right plan, especially from a financial perspective.\n\nAfter more research, we realized that most Americans ( insurance brokers included) struggle to make the right financial choice, overpaying by an estimated ~$400-$1,250 annually.
