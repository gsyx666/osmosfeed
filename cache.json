While there are certainly many successful technology startups, there are also many that fail. In this blog post, we will discuss the top 5 reasons why technology startups fail. Hopefully, this information will help you avoid making some of the common mistakes that lead to failure.\n## Top 5 Reasons Why Technology Startups Fail\nOne of the most common reasons why technology startups fail is because they lack a clear value proposition. In other words, they have an idea for a product or service, but they do not have a clear understanding of who their target customer is and what need that product or service will fill. Without this understanding, it is …",

          "description": "龙芯指 RISC-V 不能实现自主，坚持自研指令集\n\r\n龙芯之前基于 MIPS 指令，去年开始推自研的 “龙芯架构” 指令集，号称 100% 自主。龙芯公司日前称，公司创立之初就认识到基于 x86 或者 ARM 不能建立自主体系，而 MIPS 指令系统相对比较开放。但 2019 年 MIPS 开源后又闭源的事件，公司认识到基于 MIPS 也无法建立自主生态。而对于最近几年很受欢迎的 RISC-V 开源指令集，龙芯认为基于 RISC-V 同样不能构建自主生态体系，RISC-V 架构指令条数较少，比较适合学术研究以及物联网应用，商业应用会需要增加更多的指令，因此龙芯坚持自主研发指令集。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：快科技\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我坚持认为 RISC-V 开源指令集才是未来。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n单核计算机一小时破解了一种抗量子加密算法\n\r\n美国国家标准技术局（NIST）最近宣布了后量子加密和签名算法竞赛的首批获胜者。一种名为 SIKE 抗量子加密候选算法曾进入了第四轮评选，它是一种基于 Isogeny 的算法。鲁汶大学的一个团队发表论文称，他们在一台单核计算机上耗时一个小时获取了 SIKE 使用的加密密钥。SIKE 算法的发明人承认这出乎意料。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：ARS Technica\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：在量子计算还没有真正实用之前就妄想创造抗量子计算的算法，我觉得有些有些想的简单了。谁能肯定量子计算机就只能做到我们目前以为的那些事情呢，就像计算机刚刚发明之初，谁能想到如今整个世界都跑在计算机之上呢。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nFedora 37 正式支持树莓派 4\n\r\nFedora 工程和指导委员会已经确认了对树莓派 4 的“官方”支持。之前，树莓派 4 没有成为 Fedora 工作站的重点，是因为各种补丁没有被上游化，比如开源 3D 图形驱动没有上游化到内核中。现在，虽然这些上游化的工作还在进行中，但 Fedora 37 将可以提供对树莓派 4B 以及树莓派 400 和 CM4 计算模块的支持。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：之前 Pop!_OS 22.04 已经为树莓派 4 提供了支持，而 Fedora 37 也紧随其后，这都是这些驱动进入了上游后的成果，所以，真正推动 Linux 发展的的引擎，还是 Linux 内核啊。",

          "description": "经济独立后，我很快发现自己之前的消费方式需要调整。\n我之前买东西几乎没有计划，大部分是偶发性的，也有很多冲动购买。其次，我对价格有些不敏感，总觉得平台上是这个价格那就这样吧；对很多产品的质量也没有概念，常常不知道该从何判断。比如买水果，我都是让商家随机装一些就过秤拿走。我也很少考虑买东西之后的处置行为，比如多久该把东西淘汰，日用品一般要屯多久等等。\n我逐渐觉得，我应该花些心思调整自己的生活和消费——我需要一个能让我在「重复购买」「快速更迭」的商品上省钱，可以为生活长远算计的在线平台。1688 就这样进入了我的视野。\n1688 建立的初衷是为批发商或者商户找到合适的生产商，由于平台允许商户购买样品，所以个人消费者也可以在 1688 上进行购买。在 1688 平台进行了大半年采买后，我想和大家分享一下我的购物体验和购物感受，也欢迎各位朋友分享你的「批发」心得。\n本文分享的所有产品和卖家均是来自于自己及朋友购买经历，不含有任何广告或者宣传。\n在 1688 购物的原因\n在 1688 购物主要就是为了两方面：规划预算省钱，适量囤货日用。1688 正好在这两点都是强项。\n各大社交平台都有博主提过，同款的产品，其他购物平台基本价格一致，而 1688 上可以便宜一半甚至是更多。因为 1688 上的卖方是生产商，少了很多分销渠道的成本和加价。这也是为什么 1688 会有很多东西便宜到让人惊讶的原因，毕竟「要批发，上 1688」。\n举个例子，我在南方经常要用的除湿袋，在 1688 上的价格是 0.7 元一包，购买超过 250 包，会便宜到 0.68 元。而在当地超市买到的同款至少一包 2 元，有些网购平台甚至要 5 元一包。\n这是我楼下超市卖的同款，非常好用，五块钱一包。\n偶尔一包可能价格差距不大，但这种除湿袋我每年都会用掉很多，累计起来就不在少数了，带上全寝室批发则开销更大。类似的还有袜子、…",

          "description": "「记录」这件事就是非常有威力，它会把注意力之外的小细节收集起来，给予一种确实发生但又意料之外的生活视角。比如如果不是记账，我不知道原来每个月会支出那么多零零碎碎的「拿铁因子」；如果不是 HiWater，我也不会知道原来自己摄入那么多含糖饮料。\n其实我很早之前就购买过 WaterMinder 这款 App Store Editors's Choice 应用，只是彼时的我并不明白「多喝水」三个字对身体的意义，同时也觉得记录喝水这件事就像是记账——没有外部约束、「记录多少全凭诚实美德」的记录只在于自我娱乐。所以往往三天后意兴阑珊删除了事。\nHiWater 则是好友 @特伦 推荐的，把玩了下觉得还不错，但当时并不想为这个需求掏钱；不久前确诊痛风后，离开诊室满心灰暗的我有了「每天喝水 3L+」的刚需，这才发现这款应用的每一个付费点都值得我掏钱。\n作为一款国产应用，HiWater 的饮品目录预设种类都比较契合日常，并且在目录处还醒目地标注了每 100 毫升所带有的千卡热量。向下翻阅到高热量饮品时甚至有一种黑名单的既视感。\n\n如此设计的部分原因是，HiWater 采用了「饮水金字塔」模型，它将所有饮品归在六个等级内，并依此建议每日摄入的比例。此模型虽有哈佛大学公共卫生学院专家的背书，总体指导思想依然是鼓励大家多喝白水，减少摄入高糖、甚至是含糖饮料。\n关联阅读：如何合理控制糖分摄入\n\n对喝水提醒应用来说，我们一般会面临预设饮品难以覆盖真实世界情况的问题。\n所以在 HiWater 中我们也可以新增或编辑饮品类目到「饮水金字塔」模型中，把某个模糊的品类变成精确的单品。比如说 HiWater 预设了椰子水这个饮品，但我日常喝得比较多的是山姆椰子水，那我就直接编辑成山姆椰子水的营养成分，并重新归类到低卡饮料分类中去；再比如我喝的柠檬水是浓缩液和水 1:10 冲兑而来，因此我也通过计算将预设的「柠檬水」编辑成「自制柠檬水」，并由浓缩液计算出对应的热量。\n当然，手动编辑多了我们自然就会想：这些外包装上带有营养成分表的商品饮料，如何快捷记录到应用内？\nHiWater 的答案是「直接用相机扫」，请直接看这个动图：\n\n我猜测可能 Apple 在系统中给了 OCR 相关的 API，开发者就取来做这个功能了。这是我最喜欢的功能，实际使用起来识别比动图中要更迅速，识别率高且稳定。偶尔可能会有一些识别错误，比如把 ≥ 识别成 2，但我也能原谅。\n如此一来，在机场购买的农夫山泉力量帝柠檬水、屯了两箱的兰芳园低糖冻柠茶，都可以统统扫入我的饮品目录。记录时也可以根据自己的实际情况调整，比如冻柠茶虽是低糖，我还是会将它兑冰水或柠檬水喝，因此我的喝水记录里经常会出现 50 毫升的冻柠茶、紧接着出现 200 毫升的水或柠檬水。\n\n之前做手冲咖啡用的秤，现在大多被我用于称水喝，但后续我发现只要记住水倒在杯子上的花纹位置，不用秤也能大致知道这杯水的量。以名创优品的 580 毫升容积的可乐杯为例，杯内两道凹痕，分别可以粗略看作是 200/500 毫升的刻度。在公司喝水，可以考虑在工位启用大杯子装水，之前因为杯子小+次数少，上班时喝水太少。一周下来，确实每日喝水 3.3L 以上。\n\n其余的基础功能，诸如弹出提醒用户喝水、身体水分的简单预估、根据用户情况估算需要摄入的水量等，我就不一一展开了，WaterMinder 也有，我认为这些是一款「喝水类」App 都应该做的免费功能。其实我原先也是想通过快捷指令自己做一个提醒和记录每日喝水的应用，这不难，我甚至已经做好了 社死版快捷指令 定时运行，但体验过 HiWater 的一些交互后，我最后决定不折腾自己了。\n应用内还有不少花心思的交互和设计\nHiWater 多样的桌面小组件，还支出快捷录入饮品，打破了我对 iOS 小组件「能看不能用」的固有认知（我原先在 iOS 上并不使用任何 Widget，这一下就微上瘾了，顺带一口气添加了其余应用的小组件 xD）。\n精美的 Widget，支持快捷录入\nHiWater 采用免费下载+内购解锁的付费机制，如果你看完文章对它感兴趣，安装来把玩把玩也可以。如果想要为它付费的话，建议先确认自己有强烈的督促自己喝水的需求，然后订阅一个月试试——我直接买断是因为意识到「多喝水」这样的生活我可能要持续好几个月，甚至好几年，本身并不是很理性的消费习惯。\n如果一个应用能够帮助我长期维持某个健康习惯，我愿意给出「十刀买断，天大划算」的评价；如果没有，我也会用「三分钟热度三分钟收获」来安慰自己。\n> 下载 少数派 2.0 客户端、关注 少数派公众号，解锁全新阅读体验 📰\n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀",

          "description": "自《PasteNow for iOS 正式发布》后，已有三个月没有介绍 PasteNow 了。这三个月，PasteNow 也没有停止进化的脚步，分别迭代了 2.1、2.2 和 2.3 这几个版本，其中 2.3 于今天刚刚发布。本篇即是汇总一下过去三个月 PasteNow 的发展与变化。\n支持 Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴\n正如标题所说，2.3 版本带来了「Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴」的功能。这是 PasteNow 迄今为止非常重要的一个改进，不仅带来更加一致的体验，同时也大大提升效率。解决这个问题其实有点周折，我先简单地补充一下背景：\n\nWord 和 Pages，因为其固有机制的原因（也许是 Bug），它不支持剪贴板的多项目粘贴。也就说是，往剪贴板里写入多项内容，再在 Word 里操作粘贴，你会发现只有第一个内容粘贴了进去，但是如果同样在备忘录（或其他 App）里操作粘贴，是会出现多个内容的。\n\nPasteNow 的用户最早在去年7月就给我汇报了这个问题，当时我发现是 Word 和 Pages 的固有机制导致的问题后，决定暂时观察一段时间，因为也许 Word 在更新后会「修复」这个问题。\n但是等了很久，这个行为始终没有发生变化，看来确实是固有机制的限制了。正好最近又有用户汇报了相关问题，我换了一下思路，看看能不能从 PasteNow 这边做点什么的方式来解决这个问题。于是还真让我找到了一个办法。\n假如你是 Word、Pages 等的重度用户，经常需要粘贴内容至 Word、Pages 里，特别是一次性粘贴多项内容，现在通过 PasteNow 可以更好的做到这些了。请看视频！\n \n更加全面和完善的快捷键体验\n作为一个效率工具，能100%通过快捷键来达成各种操作一直是 PasteNow 重点优化的方向。在过去几个版本中，PasteNow 加强了以下两方面的快捷键体验：\n\n支持将 F1～F12 录制成快捷键了，这意味着可以用更加轻松的「单键」来达成 PasteNow 的各项操作；\n支持通过按下“@、%、$”等特殊符号也进入快速搜索模式；\n「添加标题」和「编辑文本」操作，也有了专属快捷键，分别是：Command + T 和 Command + E。\n\n相信通过以上快捷键的改进，使用 PasteNow 的过程将更加流畅。\niOS 版本的变化\n三个月前的主要事件是 iOS 版本的发布，过去三个月，iOS 版本发展的怎么样呢？这里不得不承认一个事实，这个版本并没有达到各种预期，无论是我作为开发者的预期，还是用户对它的预期。\n首先是我作为开发者的预期，目前 iOS 版本的用户非常少，日活跃用户最多时仅为 macOS 版本的 1/15。相当于 15 个 macOS 版本用户才对应 1 个 iOS 版本。这其实也是在我的预期中，但没想到会差这么多。\n另一方面是作为用户的预期，很多用户对这款 iOS 产品寄予了厚望，以为也可以像 macOS 版本一样做到后台记录剪贴板内容、实时同步剪贴板数据。但事实是这个从 iOS 的机制上就做不到，并且在即将发布的 iOS 16 里，对剪贴板的操作将会进一步变得更难。\n以上当然不是用户预期的问题，而是我在打造这款产品时没有准确的传达信息导致的，后续在 iOS 版本中，我将增加一个 FAQ 模块，让用户可以非常直观地了解到这个工具能做什么，不能做什么等等。\n当然，我依然会尽力去完善 iOS 版本的体验，使其与 macOS 的基本功能靠近，比如在 2.3 版本当中，图片类的数据，现在也可以通过长按保存至相册了。这个是会比较实用且基础的一个操作。\n小结\nPasteNow 从 1.0 发布到今天，不过一年又三个多月，它依然是一款年轻的产品，我会继续按照既定节奏去稳步迭代，不断完善它的体验与其他 App 的互操作能力。\n希望它继续给大家带来愉悦的效率之旅～\n附：少数派下载与购买链接。\n \n \n演示：PasteNow 2.3 多项目粘贴至 Word",

          "description": "本篇文章将会以 Now in Android 项目为例，讲解 Android 官方 App 模块化相关知识及策略。\n姊妹篇文章见： 我从 Android 官方 App 中学到了什么？\n概述\n模块化是将单一模块代码结构拆分为高内聚内耦合的多模块的一种编码实践。\n模块化的好处\n模块化有以下好处：\n可扩展性：在高耦合的单一代码库中，牵一发而动全身。模块化项目当采用关注点分离原则。这会赋予了贡献者更多的自主权，同时也强制执行架构模式。\n支持并行工作：模块化有助于减少代码冲突，为大型团队中的开发人员提供更高效的并行工作。\n所有权：一个模块可以有一个专门的 owner，负责维护代码和测试、修复错误和审查更改。\n封装：独立的代码更容易阅读、理解、测试和维护。\n减少构建时间：利用 Gradle 的并行和增量构建可以减少构建时间。\n动态交付：模块化是 Play 功能交付 的一项要求，它允许有条件地交付应用程序的某些功能或按需下载。\n可重用性：模块化为代码共享和构建多个应用程序、跨不同平台、从同一基础提供了机会。\n模块化的误区\n模块化也可能会被滥用，需要注意以下问题：\n太多模块：每个模块都有其成本，如 Gradle 配置的复杂性增加。这可能会导致 Gradle 同步及编译时间的增加，并产生持续的维护成本。此外，与单模块相比，添加更多模块会增加项目 Gradle 设置的复杂性。这可以通过使用约定插件来缓解，将可重用和可组合的构建配置提取到类型安全的 Kotlin 代码中。在 Now in Android 应用程序中，可以在 build-logic文件夹 中找到这些约定插件。\n没有足够的模块：相反，如果你的模块很少、很大并且紧密耦合，最终会产生另外的大模块。这将失去模块化的一些好处。如果您的模块臃肿且没有单一的、明确定义的职责，您应该考虑将其进一步拆分。\n太复杂了：模块化并没有灵丹妙药 -- 一种…",

          "description": "携手创作，共同成长！这是我参与「掘金日新计划 · 8 月更文挑战」的第 1 天，点击查看活动详情\n业务背景：\n在条件允许的情况下（无 SIM 卡的手机，无法触发一键登录），通过运行商提供的服务，进行【一键登录】。简化用户的登录操作，提高 App 的登录注册率以及使用率。\n本方案采用的是阿里云中【一键登录】方案。\n效果图：\n\n前提知识：\n整个流程如图所\n\n（图源自网络[掘金大佬-NanBox]，侵删）\n该方案下，不允许使用完全自定义的授权页。但是可以通过属性配置，进行一定的修改。可修改的属性如下图所示\n\nAndroid 接入流程：\n1.浅析 Demo\n通常第一步都是下载官方 Demo 后，进行一番调试，盘点功能列表，是否符合自身需求。\n链接：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1RX5yGp06X4GYCr4b36Sv3A 提取码：qbx0\n接下来，简单分析 Demo 项目架构，帮助大家尽快上手这个项目。\n首先，我们要知道这个 Demo，是包括【一键登录】和【本机号码校验】两个功能。根据自己的需求分析对应的代码即可。这次我们只使用到前者，所以后者内容不在这里讲述。\n\n主要看到下列三个模块：\nConfig - 就是上面预告知识中说到的配置项，主要是授权页的一些配置项\nOneKeyLoginActivity - 登录页面\nMessageActivity - 模拟【其他登录方式】页面\n那具体的实现，就可以直接看对应模块的内容即可。可以在原 Demo，进行调试。\n2.接入思路分析\n基于判断是否支持【一键登录】的时机 提供两种接入思路\n第一种：启动登录功能前判断\n\n判断的方式可以通过\nmPhoneNumberAuthHelper.checkEnvAvailable(PhoneNumberAuthHelper.SERVICE_TYPE_LOGIN)\n\n是否支持【一键登录】。该流程未经检验，大家可以执行验证。\n第二种：直接唤起【一键登录】，失败后再唤起【其他登录方式】\n\nDemo 也是第二种方式。这种方式需要用到一个壳 Activity 。但这个壳主要的作用是初始化SDK，以及做逻辑判断和处理（即并无实际内容展示）。\n这里引发一个思考：\n既然用不到 Activity 的内容，那能不能换种方式呢呢？对于单例，我思考后，一开始觉得是没问题的，但是等写完后，发现我写成了一个 OneKeyLoginHelper 的单例，发现相应逻辑处理需要传入 activity 或者 fragment 的引用。那么我们知道单例中是不能持有这样的引用的（这里可以考虑使用弱引用），这会导致内容泄漏。不知道是否还有其他的方法？\n3.代码接入流程\n//STEP 1.初始化监听器(这里根据业务自己做处理)\n//STEP 2.初始化SDK实例\n//STEP 3.设置SDK秘钥\n//STEP 4.唤起一键登录页\n4.避坑\n接着，讲一下接入过程中，遇到的一些问题。帮大家避免无效劳动，可以有更多的时间学（hua ）习（shui）。\n问题描述： 因为选择了第二种思路，那么会有个壳 Activity 的问题。这个壳，我们不处理的话，是不透明的，这样当我们进到这个壳的时候，再跳转到别的页面就会有个空白页。\n解决方案： 将壳的主题改为透明色，经过实验，下述代码可以实现。（壳Activity 需要继承 AppCompatActivity）\n<style name=\"Theme.Transparent\" parent=\"@style/Theme.AppCompat.DayNight.NoActionBar\">\n    <item name=\"android:windowBackground\">@android:color/transparent</item>\n    <item name=\"android:windowNoTitle\">true</item>\n    <item name=\"android:windowIsFloating\">true</item>\n    <item name=\"android:windowIsTranslucent\">true</item>\n    <item name=\"android:windowContentOverlay\">@null</item>\n    <item name=\"android:backgroundDimEnabled\">false</item>\n</style>\n\n问题描述： 发现从【授权页】跳到【其他方式登录】的时候，授权页会逐渐变透明，会看到下一层页面的内容。如动图中，粉红色的箭头所示。\n\n解决方案： 可以直接忽略，这个是 SDK 本身的问题。因为阿里那边给的回复是：（是否有最新解决方案，会及时更新，或者可以以你们当时咨询的为准）\n\n欢迎各位评论区留言交流。",

          "description": "Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nInstagram might have halted its controversial redesign, but that doesn’t mean the company plans to stop focusing on full-screen content. During his weekly Ask Me Anything today, CEO Adam Mosseri confirmed that Instagram will begin testing ultra-tall 9:16 photos “in a week or two.” \n“You can have tall videos, but you cannot have tall photos on Instagram,” Mosseri said. “So we thought maybe we should make sure that we treat both equally.” Currently, Instagram tops out around 4:5 when displaying vertical images that’ve been cropped accordingly. But introducing support for slimmer, taller 9:16 photos will help them fill the entire screen as you scroll through the app’s feed.\nInstagram’s TikTok-like redesign was criticized by some...\nContinue reading…",

Previously hidden behind developer flags while in testing, it finally made an official debut on ChromeOS 104, following dark mode settings popping up more in other Google products.\nIn a Google blog post mentioning the incoming feature, the company says that the new dark theme would make it easier to “read at night or in low light, and to conserve power,” which switching to a light theme changes the entire UI and wallpaper to make things “bright and airy.” Until now, ChromeOS only included a “Night Light” setting in its software to help you look at your screen in dim light by...\nContinue reading…",
