          "description": "Welcome to Everything But Code!\n\n\nThis is going to be a series of posts covering what I feel are the most important/useful topics in programming that aren't writing the actual code. \nTrue! Having the slickest workflow means nothing if the code you end up writing doesn't work. But I think that having a good setup can help you to write code more efficiently and accurately, which will ultimately lead to better code!\nIt is easy to get comfortable with a particular way of coding, and you may think it won't be worth the time adjusting to a new system, especially if you don't know for certain that it will lead to an improvement. I would encourage you to give any concepts you read here a long think before trying so that you spend that precious time on solutions you do feel could improve your coding. \nYou are probably right that your setup was the best for you ... 4 years ago. But in the four following years not only will new systems and technologies have been created, but you will also have changed. I feel that it is worth having a look at your setup every so often to ensure it is still the best for you that it possibly can.\nAbsolutely! Several of the posts in this series may be discussing things that you have never heard of before. Don't expect yourself to read through everything in one weekend and come out with the best setup ever; take your time and slowly introduce things to your workflow over time. This will allow you to adjust much more easily to each thing you introduce and give you the time and space to make sure you understand how each new introduction works with the systems you already have in place.",

But what is performance, how can it be measured, and how can it be improved? \nWeb Vitals are the parameters on which a Site’s Performance is measured. Just like in a human body we have vitals like Blood Pressure, Pulse Rate, etc which are essential to know about the performance of a person, we have parameters like Largest Contentful Paint, First Contentful Paint, Cumulative Layout Shift, First Input Delay, etc to measure a website’s performance. \nCore Web Vitals are the subset of Web Vitals that apply to all web pages. The three Core Web Vitals are: \nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP)\nFirst Input Delay (FID)\nCumulative Layou…",

          "description": "When discussing quality, complying with a particular set of requirements usually comes to mind. A client, analyst, or someone else sets tasks and people often take those as the requirements. The worst case scenario is that these requirements are taken as non-negotiable, and lead to the wrong results if followed to the letter. This often happens with outsourced development, and it can have a negative impact on the end user’s experience.\nAt SmartHead, we believe that there is more to quality than just meeting client demands. It’s not purely complying with requirements, but also the requirements themselves. We do not take only the client’s expectations into consideration, but the end user’s experience too. This means that our concept of quality also includes components such as usability, UI t…",

          "description": "以下是从 Linux 命令行自动编辑文件的一些提示和技巧。\n\r\n\r\n当我使用 Linux 命令行时，无论是在台式机上编写新程序还是在 Web 服务器上管理网站，我经常需要处理文本文件。Linux 提供了强大的工具，我可以利用这些工具来完成我的工作。我经常使用 sed，一个可以根据模式修改文本的编辑器。\n\r\nsed 代表 流编辑器Stream EDitor，它编辑文件中的文本并打印结果。使用 sed 的一种方法是识别一个字符串在文件中的几次出现，并将它们替换为不同的字符串。使用 sed 来处理文本文件的方式似乎是无穷无尽的，但我想分享一些使用 sed 来帮助我管理文件的方法。\n\r\n在 Linux 上搜索和替换文件中的文本\n\r\n要使用 sed，你需要使用一个正则表达式。正则表达式是定义模式的一组特殊字符。我最常使用 sed 的例子是替换文件中的文本。替换文本的语法如下：s/originaltext/newtext。s 告诉 sed 执行文本替换或交换出现的文本。在斜线之间提供原始文本和新文本。\n\r\n此语法将仅替换每行中第一次出现的 originaltext。要替换每个匹配项，即使在一行中原始文本出现了不止一次，要将 g 追加到表达式的末尾。例如：s/originaltext/newtext/g。\n\r\n要在 sed 中使用此表达式，请使用 -e 选项指定此正则表达式：\n\r\n$ sed -e 's/originaltext/newtext/g'\r\n\n\r\n例如，假设我有一个名为 game 程序的 Makefile 文件，该程序模拟了康威的《生命游戏》：\n\r\n.PHONY: all run clean\r\n\r\nall: game\r\n\r\ngame: game.o\r\n        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o game game.o $(LDFLAGS)\r\n\r\nrun: game\r…",

          "description": "在中国，有各种节日，有各种情人节。\n\r\n最早是从西方传来的所谓公历 2.14 的“情人节”，后来又有了 3.14 的“白色情人节”。然后，人们觉得这些节的洋味太重，何不把中国的农历七夕当成中国传统的情人节呢？而随着二次元一代，谐音梗也开始流行，不知道是谁滥觞，5.20 也被当成了一种情人节，因为谐音是“我爱您”。\n\r\n前几天，我的朋友 aulus Wren 跟我说，有位内核开发者在 Linux 内核邮件列表中向 Linus Torvalds 请求，将刚刚准备进位到 6.0 的版本号在 5.20 上停留一次，他认为这是一个在中国宣传 Linux 的好机会。就在前几天，Linus Torvalds 刚刚在邮件列表中 宣布 了 Linux 5.19 正式发布，并通告下一个版本准备“进位”到 6.0 了。\n\r\n说起来 Linux 内核的版本号，比较有意思的是从 3.0 开始主版本号就没有什么特别的意义，只是当次版本号太大时，Linus 觉得过大的数字会让他困扰，因此就“进位”到主版本号了。比如，2.6.39 之后就是 3.0，3.19 之后就是 4.0，4.20 之后就是 5.0（之所以没有在 4.19 就开始进位，也许是 Linus 忘记了）。所以，按照这种不严格的 20 进制，该进位了。\n\r\n这位名叫 Zhang Boyang（让我们称他为“张同学”）的内核开发者在内核邮件列表中向 Linus Torvalds 发起倡议：\n\r\n\r\n您能不能考虑使用 5.20 作为下一个 Linux 版本号，而不是 6.0。“5.20” 这个数字在中文中是一个文字游戏，代表 “我爱您”，所以 “Linux 5.20” 在中文中可以被读作 “我爱 Linux”。 \n\r\n\r\n他认为，这可以引起一些广泛传播，可以宣传 Linux。这个 消息 传播到国内后，褒贬不一，有人认为这是一件有趣的事情，可以向更多不了解 Linux 的人宣传 Linux；也有人认为，这事太无聊了。\n\r\n但是这封邮件并未带来什么影响，可能是它发出的时间恰逢周末，也没有得到 Linus Torvalds 的回复。\n\r\n眼看过去了一周，合并窗口接近关闭了，看来修改版本号这件事希望渺茫，张同学 再次发出 了他的倡议，请 Linus Torvalds 考虑给该版本一个命名：\n\r\n\r\n您能不能考虑将下一个 Linux 版本（5.20 或 6.0）命名为 “I love linux”？……即使下一个内核版本号是 6.0，我想对于讲中文的人和不讲中文的人来说，表达我们对 Linux 内核的爱可能都是一个好主意。\n\r\n\r\n而历史上，Linux 内核的一些版本有特别的名称，比如 Linux 5.17 就被命名为 “Superb Owl”（“超级碗”的一个文字游戏）。\n\r\n这一次，他的邮件得到了六位中国的 Linux 内核开发者的支持。但是，依旧没有得到 Linus 和其它国家开发者的回应。\n\r\n在大家的回应中，有人对 5.20 这个节日做了进一步解释，以及表达了一个并不浪漫的已婚男人对各种情人节的紧张，并表示这样的 520 挺好，不需要专门准备礼物。也有人表示，这是内核列表里面一次较大规模的“文化输出”，就像我们对美国人的“超级碗”无感一样，外国人对我们的 520可能也没什么感受。\n\r\n原本，我以为，这件事就此作罢了。不料 Linus Torvalds 在昨天发布 Linux 6.0-rc1 时，专门提到了这件事，他说，\n\r\n\r\n如果你愿意，你可以继续叫它 “Linux 5.20”。\n\r\n\r\n并且，Linus Torvalds 在这份公告里面再次重申了，主版本号变化并不代表有根本性的变化，他早就摒弃了“主版本号是有意义的”的说法了，而采用分层的版本号只是为了使版本号容易记忆而已。\n\r\n老王觉得，张同学这件事办的很好，诸位在内核邮件列表回复的同学也很给力。说到底，我们对 Linux 就是一种热爱，为什么不借着各种可能的机会来宣传它呢？虽然，Linux 越来越用在各种严肃的场合，但是 Linux，乃至开源，其本底一直是一种极客文化，“Just for Fun”，所以，为什么不呢？虽然，由于文化差异，没有得到太多的回应，但是我们的“文化输出”才能让世界对我们有更多的亲近。\n\r\n那么，你的看法呢？\n\r\n另外，你认为这样的版本号有趣吗？你会向你的爱人（如果不是计算机的话）讲这个故事吗？为了这个有爱的版本号，你是否会为 Linux 内核或更广泛的 Linux 做些什么吗（比如去修个 Bug，让你的痕迹留在 Linux 5.20 中）？\n\r\n（题图修改自：ninchanese.com）",

          "description": "本文参与数字文具盒征文活动。\n\n我是一个在读的社科博士生。大约一年多以前，我正式进入到博士研究的阶段。很快我发现，博士与硕士本科阶段不同，我面临着文章发表的压力却又缺乏充分的导师指导，由此我开始认真思考如何建立自己的知识管理与任务管理系统。感谢少数派上众多热心作者的分享，让我在这一年里了解并尝试了各种各样的笔记工具、任务管理工具以及方法论体系，并成功浪费了大量学习时间。\n然而，虽然每次看到喜欢的新工具都会马上下载使用，我却总是难以坚持下来。在经历了无数次的尝试-放弃循环后，我发觉最重要的不是工具本身，而是容纳这些工具的「盒子」——即如何最简单明了地将文件管理、项目管理、知识管理等等工具融合在一起。\n但恰恰是这些基础的东西，大部分的分享都没有详细提及，它们可能没有什么技术含量，但却是入门者最最需要的。因此，我想和大家分享一下我是如何将 Mac 桌面作为我的数字文具盒，搭建简易数字化学术工作流程的，或许能对刚开始入门的朋友有所帮助。\n首先谈谈一个普遍存在的问题：\n\n为什么我看到某某博主介绍的某款笔记工具非常酷炫，非常符合自己的需求，但是就是用不下去呢？\n\n可能有这几方面的原因：\n\n工具学习成本过高，难以上手。\n工具与自己正在使用的工具功能、工作习惯冲突，无法完全融入到自己的工作流中。\n自己太懒工具使用需要耗费时间精力，没有养成使用习惯，产生拖延。\n\n就我自己的探索经历来说，这几方面的问题一般共同存在。\n举个例子，初次知道 logseq 这个双链笔记应用的时候，我觉得它就是完美的笔记工具，于是马上下载试用，每天在它的 dailynote 里面记录各种各样的东西，包括每日任务、未来计划、会议记录、研究灵感、阅读笔记，项目总结等等，然后用双链加以整理。\n但是一段时间后发现，它和之前的工具产生了冲突。比如我的文献 pdf 是用 Zotero 来管理的，这就导致每次查阅文献都要同时打开两…",

          "description": "theme: smartblue\n编译常见问题\n在开发过程中，有碰到过一些由于编译优化导致的代码修改并不符合我们预期的情况。这也就是之前为什么我经常说编译产物其实是不太可以被信任的。\n方法签名变更，底层仓库的方法变更但是上层模块并没有跟随一起重新编译导致的这个问题。\n常量优化，将一些常量的调用点直接替换成常量的值。\n删除空导包， 没有用的一些导包就会做一次剔除。\n最近倒霉了\n我们最近碰到一个pipeline相关而且很妖怪的问题。我们一个pipeline会检查apk产物中是否存在异常的方法调用，就是之前介绍的在R8的基础上开发出来的A8。但是最近有一个类被删除了之后呢，但是代码中还有一处调用点。但是这个检测竟然被通过了，然后这部分代码就被合入了master。\n\n这个引用的文件就如上图所示，是一个debug buildType中的，所以并不是所有的apk中都会存在这部分代码。\n然后呢，这个MergeRequest就被合入了master分支，因为当天是我们出下一个版本包的时间，然后交付给测试的就是全量编译的debug和release包。别的开发同学rebase完master之后就发现piepline都跑不过了，就导致了他们当天的代码无法被合入。\n这个就是事情大概的起因和经过，但是各位有没有想过为什么会发生这个问题吗。这个是不是我们的pipeline出现了bug，导致了这种问题无法被识别出来了呢。\n以前有说过，如果简单的说我们的快编系统就是把模块替换成对应的aar，从而达到编译提速。所以因为我们使用的是这个模块对应的aar产物，所以大概率就是因为这个模块的编译产物和源代码有差异导致了这个问题。\n其实这个问题一出现我就已经知道大概率是由空导包优化导致的这个问题，因为在pipeline检查的时候，检测的apk产物中确实不存在这个导包。因为我们使用的是一个历史版本的aar，其中无效导包的部分已经被编译器做了删除空导包的优化了。接下来我们看下我写的一个demo中的无效导包。\n\n\n图一呢是源代码java文件，图二呢则是jar包中的代码。可以简单的看出来行号呢是可以对应的上的，但是这个AppCompatActivity的无效导包在产物中已经被优化掉了。这里也就回答了在编译过程中会保留行号，但是也会优化掉一部分不需要的代码，让我们编译出来的产物更小。\n所以也就导致了我们的产物和我们的源代码之间的差异，另外一个角度就是说从apk中我们确实是不存在这个类的导包。但是呢在我们把这部分代码重新编译成aar的时候，就会出现source缺失，导致的语法树无法生成，之后导致的编译失败问题。\n这也就是所以我一直和大家说编译产物是不可以被信任的呢。\n以前倒霉过\n这个是之前的一个故事了，我们之前呢在模块中定义了一些静态常量吧，然后用来标识当前SDK的版本，然后这个值在别的模块中被引用到了。\n有一次因为需求变更，我们更改了这个静态变量的值，然后呢我就把这个需求提测了。之后测试反馈给我为什么这边的这个值没有变化啊。\n\n我的天，当时我就是这样，发生了什么情况。然后呢我全量打了个包好了，我当时也就以为只是编译时的一个bug而已。然后后来呢，我查了下资料发现这个就是一个java编译时的常量优化问题。过了一阵子吧，我面试了下字节跳动，然后我和面试官也聊了下这个话题，然后呢在这个方法签名变更的问题上，当时我略输一筹，哈哈哈哈。接下来我们就看下一个demo。\n\n\n图1呢也是java代码，图2呢则是aar中的编译产物。其中我们可以看到，这个静态常量在编译成产物之后就会被编译成这样。\n所以这个就解释了我一开始碰到的这个问题，他就是由于我们的编译器已经把aar中的这部分静态常量编译成了直接的值，然后呢我们的源变化之后如果没有重新编译对应的模块，就会导致这个值一直无法被更新到最新的值。\n结论\n如果大家对安卓编译相关有兴趣的话，这些问题很可能都会在面试的时候被问到。希望这不仅仅只是一篇我对于这些问题的思考，也能对各位有所帮助吧。",

          "description": "Embracer Group has embarked on an acquisition spree today that includes Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, and the IP rights to Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. There are five acquisitions in total today, alongside a sixth undisclosed deal for a company in the PC and console gaming space.\nThe Lord of the Rings and Hobbit rights mean Embracer now has control over movies, video games, board games, merchandising, stage productions, and even theme-park rights for the Tolkien fantasy franchises. This includes Amazon’s very big and expensive take on Lord of the Rings that will debut on Prime Video on September 2nd. Embracer notes that it could even explore “additional movies based on iconic characters such as Gandalf, Aragorn, Gollum,...\nContinue reading…",

Previously, it recommended CRANE, but now you might want to slate this new one into your repertoire.  \nThe NYT introduced WordleBot in April as a “daily companion” to help analyze your Wordle play, and with WordleBot 2.0, the team has made some changes. One of the bigger changes is that the bot no longer limits its analysis to the subset of five letter words that are known Wordle solutions — that is, it’s thinking more like a typical human player would. Previously, the bot could have judged you harshly for guessing a legit word that, for whatever reason, isn’t one of the possible Wordle solutions, which...\nContinue reading…",

Try to keep moving your pointer slightly faster than your comfort zone to increase the reading speed.\n\n⚡️ Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP): In RSVP, a series of words appear rapidly in time at the same point in visual space. Indeed, the words may appear as fast as 10 items per second.\n\n\n\n\n⚡️ Reading Mode: distraction-free & ad-blocking reading viewer focusing on the main content.\n\n⚡️ Reading Analytics: Keep track of your reading goals including total words and words per minute daily, weekly, and monthly \n\nWe recommend moving your pointer with almost constant speed. Try to keep moving your pointer slightly faster than your comfort zone to increase the reading speed.  \n\nTry to read faster so that you catch up with your pointer. If you start losing comprehension, slow your pointer down. Otherwise, consider moving your pointer even faster.\n\n★ Privacy & Support\n\nWhat you read is your business.\n\nWe do not sell, rent, license, or otherwise monetize your data in any way.\n\nBy installing the extension, you agree to Reading Buddy's Privacy Policy.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
