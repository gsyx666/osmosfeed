Just look on Glassdoor.\nI'm sure some people have found Glassdoor useful. It probably works well for \"Web Developer in San Francisco\" because that's like 42% of the city population. Does that mean it universally applies, that the data isn't shit or useless elsewhere? Not in my experience.\nDo you remember that after hearing the tip \"just do your own research\" for the first time, you knew exactly what to do? Well good for you, but many developers I know are not like that.\nYour friend is asking an important question, she is at risk of being underpaid for many years in her life.

In this we are going to explore databases.\nA database (DB) is a central system in which data is stored is queried.\nIt is used to query and store structured data. \nIt has no relational or tabular schema.\nA transactional system records transaction that encapsulates specific events, organization wants to track.\nHere transaction can be taken as unit of small work.\nOLTP relies on system optimized for CRUD operations, to support transactional workloads.\nNow what are these ACID properties...\nC stands for Consistency\nI stands for Isolation\nD stands for durability\nOLTP supports live applications.\nIt  used read only system, stores vast volume of historical data metrics.\nData files are stored\nExtract, Transform and Load (ETL) process copies data from files to OLTP databases to data warehouse.\n\n\nData in warehouse may be aggregate to OLAP model. Aggregate numeric values are calculated from fact table.\n\n\nData in data lake, warehouse and analytical model is queries.\n\n\n\nSome terms we should know : \nData Lakes : Large volume of file based data must be collected and analyzed.\n\n\nData warehouses : Stores data in relational database which is optimized for read operations.\n\n\nOLAP model : Data storage for analytical workloads\n\n\n\nThanks for reading this blog :)\nI have one request to everyone reading this, please do not refer it for preparation.

          "description": "Since I heard about Bun, I've been super excited to try it.\nBefore we dive into the nitty gritty of setting Bun up, let's take a moment to talk about what it is.\nBun is a brand new JavaScript runtime, much like you know Node and potentially Deno already.\nIt comes packed with 90% of the Node-API function, plus it comes with all the fantastic Web APIs like fetch, WebSockets, and so on.\nI won't go into the details, but Bun is written on the JavaScriptCore engine instead of the V8 engine. They wrote the code in ZIG, which helps with memory management.\nAlright, I'm not one for long background stories and am eager to see how it works and performs.\nFirst, let's install Bun.\ncurl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash\n\nNow create a folder, and inside add a http.js file with the following contents.\n// http.js\nexport default {\n  port: 3000,\n  fetch(request) {\n    return new Response('Welcome to Bun!');\n  },\n};\n\nNow run the following command in this folder:\nbun run http.js\n\nAnd if we now visit http://localhost:3000/ we should see the welcome from Bun.\n\nAs Bun is still very much being developed and limited now, I wouldn't rush to migrate all your applications as some essentials still need to be developed.\nHowever, getting a feel for it is good, as it might become the following big framework for runtimes.\nThank you for reading my blog.

          "description": "前言\n为了在上班前再抓紧时间享受一下旅行的快乐，我和女朋友一起去了一趟杭州和绍兴。十年前，我和父母曾经去过一次杭州和苏州，但那时正值盛夏，酷暑难耐，我的父亲出行时又是出了名的紧张和暴躁，导致少了不少游玩的乐趣，杭州在我心目中也并没有留下什么深刻的印象。在一位杭州「土著」同学的怂恿下，为了帮助杭州洗刷这个对她并不公平的心理评价，我决定再来一次杭州。\n按照这位同学说，我们这一次来得正是时候，赶上了杭州为期两周的秋天，早来了太热，晚来了太冷。\n她是没错的。九月底的杭州真的是——好舒服啊！\n除了正午那几个小时，杭州的天气这几天一直稳定在很适宜的温度，在室内和室外几乎没有温差。哪怕是上午快十二点，大晴天走在大街上也只是有丝丝暖意，如果这时候有几阵微风从西湖吹来，送上岸边荷叶清新的香气和清凉，我就会情不自禁地把手臂张开，闭上眼睛，好好感受这让人舒服得跺脚的惬意。\n因为我们这一次以休闲游为主，并没有安排很满的行程，这几天都是睡到自然醒，吃完饭中午才出门，所以行程上也安排得不是很有效率。作为一个旅行攻略太过勉强，但也确确实实享受到了放空身心的那种悠闲和惬意。\n灵隐寺\n食\n很惭愧，这一次是摆烂的行程。因为不想时间太紧张，所以并没有专门搜一些当地人才会去的苍蝇馆子，吃的都是比较常见的连锁餐厅，外婆家、新白鹿、绿茶。我这个外地人尝不出地不地道，但坐着挺舒适，味道也挺好的。我特别喜欢西湖天地那家外婆家，旁边就是西湖，吃完饭去消消食也是一流的。\n第一天晚上杭州的同学带我们去银泰附近吃了一家名为杭州酒家的餐厅。据说已经有一百年历史了。叫花鸡被一层壳包裹，需要客人颇具仪式感地亲自敲几下，而后师傅再帮忙敲开，鸡肉已经酥软无比，香味甚至渗进了骨头；熏鱼比我想象中的多汁，带着一种甜甜的味道；藕粉样子很好看，但感觉味道稍淡了些，响铃沾了不同的酱料味道很丰富。\n叫化鸡响铃\n住\n这次我们选择了在湖滨步行街附近的一家…",

          "description": "在正式开始教程之前首先说明一下目前国行系统的状态：最新版三星云（5.2.00.5）屏蔽了OneDrive备份的入口，直接删除了相关备份软件的服务。因此要在国行系统机器上继续使用OneDrive备份需要降级三星云。如果对Samsung Pay没有需求而对同步有比较大的需求，最简单的方法是刷港版系统。本教程基于One UI 4.1，国行S20。所有需要的安装包均可在教程链接或者apkmirror网站上找到。\n在开始之前需要的准备：一个非大陆地区的三星账号，一个微软账号（需要是个人账号），一个非国行系统的三星手机（也可以是你的国行设备刷港版系统），以及一部国行系统的三星手机（操作对象）。\n第一步，绑定三星账号和微软账户。\n在非国行系统的手机上登录三星账号，然后在相册的设置里，找到云同步，点击按照提示登录微软账户。其中某些步骤容易因为网络原因卡住，不过由于我从来没遇到过，所以有需求的建议在酷安上搜索相关资料，或者全程科学网络。这一步很简单，因此不做过多阐述。\n第二步，降级三星云。\n一般来说，国行系统的三星云会被强制自动更新，因此要想使用备份需要先降级三星云。\n目前在apkmirror上找到能安装也能备份的最新版是5.1.00.13，由于版本号相比国行最新版三星云5.1.05.9更低，需要重新安装。可以现在系统里卸载三星云，再安装此版本的三星云。如果不想重新同步之前的云数据，可以使用ADB直接降级安装。代码我放在下面（为了方便输入，包名我改成了123.apk）\nadb install -r -d D:\\123.apk\n第三步，在国行设备上进行后续操作。\n登录账号之后，下载一个OneDrive，登录之前和三星账户绑定的那个微软账户。登录成功之后就可以暂时忽略这个软件。然后按照链接里的方法在手机上安装lycan，这一步是关键，否则之后的操作都无法进行。\nhttps://www.coolapk.com/feed/32708070?shareKey=YWUwNDI3ZTU5Y2FmNjMzMTVlN2M~&shareUid=964712&shareFrom=com.coolapk.app_5.0.2\n下载「创建快捷方式」这个软件\n【创建快捷方式】 ，打开之后右上角三个点勾选「也显示系统应用」，搜索三星云。点击进入三星云的活动列表，搜索「dashboard」，找到图中这个活动，然后创建一个快捷方式放在桌面。\n\n如果此时打开这个快捷方式，会进入OneDrive同步的那个页面，但是会提示三星云需要更新才能同步，如果不更新就会强制退出。所以我们需要用到lycan屏蔽这个更新提示。\n打开lycan，搜索三星云，在「服务」中将uploadtodrive两项设置成enable\n\n在「接收器」中将下图三项禁用，三项名字均带有update\n\n在「服务」中打开下图两项\n\n此时重新打开刚刚那个快捷方式，就能够正常同步了。\n成功效果如图\n\n如果之后打开三星云又提示更新，可以按照之前的方法降级三星云。不排除之后的系统更新会屏蔽这个接口的可能，只能说且用且珍惜。",

          "description": "时间切片 Time Slice 是延时摄影的静态表现形式：你通过固定机位并在特定的时间间隔内拍摄一系列照片，得到一组静态照片，然后在后期的时候按照时间顺序，取每一张照片的局部，然后拼接起来，便得到一个名为时间切片的照片。\n2022 年 7 月份在梧桐山顶拍摄了一组日落时分的延时照片，并在后期导入电脑并使用 DaVinci Resolve 合成延时视频的时候，我突然想起一个朋友在 2013 年输出的一个时间切片照片。于是也想给我这组照片制作一个时间切片。\n后期制作时间切片是一道很复杂的工程（比如，可以参考这里），随着照片数目的增多，操作步骤会越多。在正式使用 Photoshop 尝试制作时间切片之前，我就直接有个想法，要不自己实现一把？\n事实上，使用程序来实现一点都不难：给一组照片排好序后，在一个大的画布上，依次取该照片特定的区域，然后绘制到该画布的同样的区域就能实现这种效果。最开始我是在 Android 上进行这块的测试，后来很快就完成并验证了效果的可用性。后来想了下，MyerTidy 虽然目前的功能只有「整理文件」，但它实际上是可以定位为一个「批量处理」的 app。\n最后便有了 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新（暂时只有 macOS 版本）。\n此版本带来以下的变化：\n\n重新设计的带响应式布局的首页，为未来支持更多批量操作进行前置的支持\n新增各个模式的功能介绍以及效果图\n支持「延时切片」功能，正如上文所说的，可以为你制作时间切片照片。在下文会做更详细的介绍\n进行了小部分重构和性能优化\n\n在首页选择了「延时切片」后，你便可以选择一个文件夹或者一组照片了，之后会自动进行预览渲染：\n\n \n默认的效果是，根据你的文件名升序排序，从左到右，不对图片进行采样来进行绘制。\n比如你有文件名为 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg 到 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg 的 100 张图片，会使用以下顺序从左到右来绘制：\n\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_002.jpg\n…\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg\n\n效果如上。\n \n你可以点击「倒序处理」，来使用倒序的方式来从左到右绘制：\n\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_100.jpg\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_099.jpg\n…\n绘制 TIMELAPSE_001.jpg\n\n效果如下：\n\n \n如果你觉得你的图片太多了，想以固定的间隔来取一部分来绘制，那么可以在「跳过合成的数目」来输入你要跳过的数目 X。也就是，每隔 X 张，只会取一张来绘制。\n\n跳过的数目为 5 的情况下，每 5 张会选择第一张来绘制。\n对于上述图片，跳过数目设定为 50 的时候（原图片总数目为 654 张）效果如下：\n\n \n最后，上述的布局方式都是「水平布局」：图片以水平方向来进行绘制。\n你可以点击「垂直布局」，来开启从上到下的绘制模式，效果如下：\n\n此外特别注意的一点是，MyerTidy 目前不支持图片自动对齐。因此如果你的图片组因为前期拍摄的原因有部分图片对不齐，那么需要你先使用 Photoshop 等工具来前期做对齐（当然，相比做时间切片来说，应该不算太困难）。如果需求强烈，那么可能会调研并加入这块的支持。\n以上便是 MyerTidy v1.1.1 的更新。未来会专注 macOS 下对文件和图片的「批处理」的实现，目前期望会做的下一个大功能便是对文件按照特定的规则批量重命名（比如整理番剧之类的，会很有用），也在思考是否可以加入类似「星轨合成」这样的功能。\n你可以通过 App Store 搜索 MyerTidy 来进行下载。如果你有什么想法和反馈，欢迎留言。",

We've also added a bunch of features developers we're demanding from us...\n\n💅 Pre built themes  - We will be making pre-made themes so you can get going right away. No styling necessary. \n\n🧰 Extend appearance of theme -  Not happy with the prebuilt themes? Override variables from prebuilt themes with your own styles.\n\n🌓 Theme sets (dark mode) -  Extend and configure multiple sets of styles in a single theme. That means you can include dark mode, light mode, sepia mode...  \n\n✏️ Custom css classes and inline styles - Inject css classes so you can target specific elements and also inline styles. A prepended ClassName can also be added to all elements.\n\n📣 Custom labels -  Use your own text for any of the labels, so you can now accommodate for various languages, or perhaps different tones of voice.\n\n\nWhat's the future of Auth UI?\nWe'd like to keep working on this and improve it for more use cases such as:\n\n📞 Phone auth - Support for Supabase Phone Auth, so a user can input their OTP into the Auth UI to log in.\n\n🏗 More frameworks - We've only shipped React so far, but we've had requests for Svelte and Flutter support.\n\n🪪 Profile UI - Perhaps prebuilt UI for viewing user information, user profile, and user actions to update password, update details and so on.\n\n\nOne more thing...It's all open source.\n\nView all the code here right now on GitHub.\n\n---\n\nThanks everyone.\nFeel free to leave your positive (and negative) feedback and comments.\n\nJonny,\nSupabase team\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
