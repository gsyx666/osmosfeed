          "description": "Before Starting learning NodeJS or Blindly following any tutorial it is very crucial to know what is NodeJs  ? For what purpose it is used for and with tonnes of option why we should go with NodeJS . So without any delay let's dive into it. 😀\nWhat is NodeJS ?\nSo before NodeJS one can't run JavaScript Code to our system.Now don't confuse here.Before NodeJS developers can write JS Code but in order to see the Working they have to run it on the Browser like we will do when we initially learning HTML, CSS , JavaScript and somehow even now. \nSo, When NodeJS was Introduced one can run Javascript code outside the Browser i.e. in our Terminals in any Operating System.\nThus,\nFor what Purpose we use NodeJS ?\nNode.js is widely used for creating  back-end of applications. \nFor Example : Express.js which is a NodeJS web application framework used to build the back-end of classic web applications.\nWhy you Choose NodeJS from Tonnes  of Back-End Development Tools ?\nSo, here I am not Saying that NodeJS is the best for Backend Development and other are less efficient than this.But if someone who is a Front-End Developer, Javascript Developer, ReactJS Developer or know Javascript Libraries and Framework then NodeJS is boon for him/her as they don't need to learn any new language.\nNode.js follows a single threaded model  which means there is no possibility of Deadlocks in this.\nMoreover , Node.js is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, so its library is very fast in code execution.\nThat's all about it's Introduction. I will come up with more Blogs related to MERN Technology soon.",

So here are some of the commands I discovered, and seems they aren't popular enough. Without wasting time, let's dive into it.\ngit log a useful tool for looking back and reading the history of every action taken with a repository. A git log's multiple settings can be utilized to narrow down history. The git log typically contains a list of commits. And sometimes the list is so big it's hard to find anything we need. Let me show you an easier way to do the same, but the output is short yet brief.\nIt's super helpful to check the latest commits. With the --oneline flag, each commit is reduced to a single line.

          "description": "VirtualBox 7.0 是自其上次大版本更新以来的一次重大升级。有一些不错的进步！\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n对 VirtualBox 来说，这是一次大的升级。这个版本值得关注，因为我们在最近几年没有看到过它的大版本更新。\n\r\n对于那些不熟悉 VirtualBox 的人来说，它是一个由 甲骨文公司 开发的虚拟化软件。\n\r\n随着 VirtualBox 7.0 的推出，增加了许多新功能。\n\r\n让我们来看看其中最关键的一些。\n\r\nVirtualBox 7.0 的新内容\n\r\n\n\r\nVirtualBox 7.0 是一次有益的升级。有图标更新、主题改进，以及一些关键的亮点，包括：\n\r\n\r\n一个显示运行中的客体Guest的性能统计的新工具。\n\r\n支持安全启动。\n\r\n支持全加密虚拟机Full VM Encryption（通过 CLI）。\n\r\n重新设计的新建虚拟机向导。\n\r\n\r\n通过命令行管理的全加密虚拟机\n\r\n虚拟机（VM）现在可以完全加密了，但只能通过命令行界面。\n\r\n这也包括加密的配置日志和暂存状态。\n\r\n截至目前，用户只能通过命令行界面对机器进行加密，未来将增加不同的方式。\n\r\n新的资源监控工具\n\r\n\n\r\n新的实用程序可以让你监控性能统计，如 CPU、内存使用、磁盘 I/O 等。它将列出所有正在运行的客体的性能统计。\n\r\n这不是最吸引人的补充，但很有用。\n\r\n改进的主题支持\n\r\n对主题的支持在所有平台上都得到了改进。在 Linux 和 macOS 上使用原生引擎，而在 Windows 上，有一个单独的实现。\n\r\n对安全启动的支持\n\r\nVirtualBox 现在支持安全启动，增强了对恶意软件、病毒和间谍软件的安全性。\n\r\n它还将防止虚拟机使用损坏的驱动程序启动，这对企业应用非常重要。\n\r\n使用那些需要安全启动才能运行的操作系统的用户现在应该能够轻松创建虚拟机了。\n\r\n其他变化\n\r\nVirtualBox 7.0 是一次重大的升级。因此，有几个功能的增加和全面的完善。\n\r\n例如，新件虚拟机向导现在已经重新设计，以整合无人值守的客体操作系统安装。\n\r\n\n\r\n其他改进包括：\n\r\n\r\n云端虚拟机现在可以被添加到 VirtualBox，并作为本地虚拟机进行控制。\n\r\nVirtualBox 的图标在此版本中得到了更新。\n\r\n引入了一个新的 3D 栈，支持 DirectX 11。它使用 DXVK 来为非 Windows 主机提供同样的支持。\n\r\n支持虚拟 TPM 1.2/2.0。\n\r\n改进了多显示器设置中的鼠标处理。\n\r\nVorbis 是音频录制的默认音频编解码器。\n\r\n\r\n你可以查看 发行说明 以了解更多信息。\n\r\n如果你正在寻找增强的功能，如更好的主题支持、加密功能、安全启动支持和类似的功能添加，VirtualBox 7.0 是一个不错的升级。\n\r\n💬 你对这次升级有什么看法？你会使用较新的版本还是暂时坚持使用旧版本的虚拟机？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/virtualbox-7-0-release/\n\r\n作者：Sourav Rudra 选题：lkxed 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "微软发布免费的 AI 图像合成软件\n\r\n微软宣布了基于 OpenAI 的 DALL-E 2 模型的应用 Designer。用户可通过输入文字提示生成一系列图像。Designer 有免费版和付费版，将提供给微软 365 个人和家庭订阅用户。目前 Designer 作为一个免费的 Web 应用供公众测试和获取反馈，类似的技术将整合到 Edge 浏览器和 Bing 搜索引擎中。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：ARS Technica\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：AI 图像生成已经势不可挡，虽然目前还有一些道德瑕疵，但是这总是能解决的。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nGNU 工具链考虑将其基础设施转移到 Linux 基金会\n\r\nGNU 工具链是 GNU/Linux 生态系统、云和嵌入式环境的基石。红帽公司资助的 SourceWare.org 多年来一直在托管 GNU 工具链的大部分基础设施，但最近有提议将其基础设施转移到 Linux 基金会提供的 IT 服务下。Linux 基金会的 IT 服务将管理 Git 存储库、邮件列表、错误跟踪器、网站、CI/CD 以及相关的基础设施。GNU 工具链的领导层已经正式表态支持这一提议。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这件事 Linux 基金会做的不错，毕竟有专门的组织来负责维护，总比红帽员工兼职维护更可靠些。毕竟，现在这种基础软件的安全一旦动摇，影响的范围已经不仅仅是个人爱好者了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nDebian GNU/Linux 14 代号已确定为“Forky”\n\r\nDebian 方面今天宣布，计划 2027 年发布的 Debian 14 将被称为 “Forky”。Debian 的代号是以《玩具总动员》系列中的玩具命名的。即将在 2023 年发布的 Debian 12 代号为“Bookworm”，而 2025 年发布的 Debian 13 的代号是 “Trixie”。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：不知道《玩具总动员》中有多少个的有名字的玩具，要是用完了怎么办。",

          "description": "如果你在搜索引擎中输入“ARPANET”，搜索相关图片，你会看到许多地图的图片，上面是这个上世纪六十年代末七十年代初 美国政府创建的研究网络，该网络不断延伸扩展，横跨了整个美国。我猜很多人第一次了解到 ARPANET 的时候都看过这种地图。\n\r\n可以说，这些地图很有意思，毕竟我们很难想象过去连接网络的计算机是那么少，就连如此低保真的图片都可以表示出美国全部机器的所在位置（这里的低保真lo-fi指的是高射投影仪成像技术，而不是大家熟知的 lo-fi 氛围音乐）。不过，这些地图是有问题的。地图上用加粗的线条连接着大陆各地，强化了人们的一种观念：ARPANET 最大的贡献就是首次将横跨美国东西两地的电脑连接了起来。\n\r\n今天，即便是在病毒肆虐、人们困居家中的情况下，网络也能把我们联系起来，可谓是我们的生命线。所以，如果认为 ARPANET 是最早的互联网，那么在那之前世界必然相互隔绝，毕竟那时还没有今天的互联网，对吧？ARPANET 首次通过计算机将人们连接起来，一定是一件惊天动地的大事。\n\r\n但是，这一观点却与历史事实不符，而且它也没有进一步解释 ARPANET 的重要性。\n\r\n初露锋芒\n\r\n华盛顿希尔顿酒店坐落于国家广场National Mall东北方向约 2.4 千米处的一座小山丘山顶附近。酒店左右两侧白色的现代化立面分别向外延展出半个圆形，活像一只飞鸟的双翼。1965 年，酒店竣工之后，《纽约时报》报道称这座建筑物就像“一只栖息在山顶巢穴上的海鸥” [1]。\n\r\n不过，这家酒店最有名的特点却深藏在地下。在车道交汇处下方，有着一个巨大的蛋形活动场地，这就是人们熟知的国际宴会厅International Ballroom，多年来一直是华盛顿特区最大的无柱宴会厅。1967 年，大门乐队在此举办了一场音乐会。1968 年，“吉他之神”吉米·亨德里克斯也在此举办了一场音乐会。到了 …",

          "description": "相信对于很多小伙伴来说，Twitter并非单纯是一个“社交”平台，而是“信息获取”平台。通过追踪各类名人、机构的账号来了解所关注领域的最新动向。比如最近火热的NFT、Web3.0社区中就有大量的意见领袖在Twitter发声。\n然而从获取信息效率的视角来看，常规Twitter浏览界面并不是特别友好，时间线上有着各类广告，同时经常用着用着就发现自己迷失在几十个选项卡和搜索结果页中。如果你遇到过类似问题，并希望提高在Twitter获取信息的效率，我会强烈推荐Tweetdeck这个功能。\nTweetdeck是Twitter官方提供的在线工具，有模块化，高度自定义化的浏览界面，不仅适合专业的Twitter运营人员工作使用，也非常适合个人用户来改造优化自己的信息时间线。通过对比图片，可以很清楚的看到两种模式的差异。Tweetdeck可以在设置中选择 黑/白 两种显示模式，我个人更喜欢黑暗模式，看起来更轻松。\n4K显示器下的twitter常规界面，大量留白非常浪费空间4K显示器下的tweetdeck界面\n \n基础介绍\nTweetdeck和常规界面相比最重要的功能主要是3点：自动刷新、多列显示和自定义模块。自动刷新不需要过多解释，节省频繁刷新的操作和时间。自定义模块可以定制每一列种显示的内容，例如：\n\n我想单独查看Elon Musk的所有推特或者他直发的内容。 - 单用户模式\n我希望把多个账号归为一个主题，单独浏览，如：NBA球星们、实时股市新闻、NFT相关资讯。 - 清单模式\n我想追踪网友对正在发生的热点事件的评论，如：WWDC大会、俄乌冲突事件等 - 搜索模式\n\n多列显示则大幅度提升了屏幕利用率，让我们可以同时间追踪上述这些不同的主题。\n\n上图是我最近使用Tweetdeck的截图，我通过Vivaldi浏览器“垂直平铺”功能在右边放置了Tesla AI Day的视频直播，在左边放置了Tweetdeck，并添加了：“tesla ai day”搜索结果列、“tesla bot”搜索结果列、Elon的个人内容列，和常用的市场资讯列。\n \n模块选择\n在Tweetdeck中，可以选择添加多种不同的模块，其中包含，\n内容类模块：单用户模式、搜索模式、清单模式、正在流行内容等\n功能类模块：通知、站内信、@我的、已预约内容等\n我并没有做账户运营的需求，因此最常使用的还是：搜索结果、单个用户、多用户清单这几个内容类模块。\n可添加模块截图\n \n搜索模式：\n显示关键词搜索结果配合自动刷新功能，达成“直播”的效果。并且可以通过设置条件对搜索结果进一步筛选，可设置条件包含：\n\n按推文类型过滤：例如包含图片、视频、GIF等的推文；或者是否显示“转发”内容。\n筛选内容的发布时间范围，最小单位可以精确到半个小时。\n按照推文语言类型筛选，例如：中文、英文、日语等。\n筛选推文发布者：选择特定的单个用户或者一组用户的搜索结果。\n内容互动情况：显示至少有多少点赞、转发或评论的内容。\n\n \n单用户模式 & 多用户清单：\n这2个模式本质差别就是关注用户的多少，选定关注范围后的筛选条件选项完全一致。在这2个模块中，同样可以通过设置筛选条件，包含：\n\n按推文类型过滤：例如包含图片、视频、GIF等的推文；或者是否显示“转发”内容。\n关键词过滤：显示或排除包含指定关键词的内容。\n用户筛选：由指定用户发布的内容 或 @特定用户的内容。\n\n在Tweetdeck追踪的，不管是单用户还是清单，并不要求是关注的账户。这点非常贴心，也帮助我区分不同使用场景，我把大量“新闻资讯”类账号从关注列表中去除，放在Tweetdeck清单中，日常在手机上浏览就不会被刷屏，而更关注轻松的内容，坐在电脑前则可以追踪查看这些庞杂的资讯。\n在Tweetdeck创建的清单可以选择设置为公开或者私有列表，同时这个列表也会同步到常规界面左侧的列表按钮中。\n\n \n模块设置：\n这几个内容模块中都可以单独设置“媒体展示尺寸大小”，可以大体理解为模块中每一条内容的高度。以及是否通过“声音”或者“桌面通知”的形式发送通知，提示关注的内容有更新。\n\nTweetdeck是简单，但又很强大的工具，给我带来了很多的便利，也希望分享给大家，打造适合自己的内容模块。\n \nPS：\nTweetdeck访问地址：https://tweetdeck.twitter.com\n今年Twitter官方下架了Tweetdeck的桌面客户端软件，仅提供网页版本，如果想在电脑上安装独立客户端可以使用Tweeten，有Windows和Mac版本，并且基于Tweetdeck提供了更多的功能。\nTweeten部分功能展示\n题图源自：Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n更多内容欢迎访问我的个人博客：「假设检验」",

You can't avoid async programming to create a fast and reactive application. Applications with a high amount of file or network I/O or with a GUI that should always be reactive benefit tremendously from async programming. Tasks can be executed in the background while the user still makes inputs. Async programming is possible in many languages, each with different styles and syntax. Rust is no exception. In Rust, this feature is called async-await.\nWhile async-await has been an integral part of Rust since version 1.39.0, most applications depend on community crates.

As a freelancer, you ended up subscribing to many services like Adobe CC, Envato Elements, Render forest, etc... Once you get to the cap of your monthly payments budget, you can't keep adding tools that require monthly payments as well! So I was looking for an alternative powerful enough to handle my needs and that doesn't offer a subscription only deal. I found Pasty! This app was more powerful than Paste, and it also offers a one time payment deal. It changed my life and put me back on track, giving me the productivity speed and useful features I was used to with Paste app. If you're like me and need an alternative without a monthly payment, Pasty is without a doubt better, faster and super useful. I recommend this app 100%.

          "description": "What is the problem\nUntil the web app we organized ourselves either with group chats or, well, we didn’t. We ended in text message chaos, missed the messages or simply forgot about them. In the end we had 3 hair dryers but no extra gas for the gas stove. \nSometimes we bought things and at the trip a friend notes: “Oh, I would have had that at home.”.\n\nHow we solve the problem\nWith a super simple app which is easy to share, simple to access and doesn’t need a new native app on the smartphone. We called our little problem solver whobrings.com\n\nFeatures\n- Simply share the list URL with your group\n- Together add items to a list\n- Assign yourself if you can bring an item\n- Set the amount and description of an item\n- Split the people who bring an item if the amount is bigger than 1\n- Start a survey if others think the item is needed\n- Live updates and list changes\n\nCommon use cases\nGroups organize their next adventure or mostly camping holidays.\nTeachers and parents organize school meetings.\nFamilies organize family gatherings and events.\nSmall business teams organize meetings.\n              ”\n              \nDiscussion\n            |\n            Link",
