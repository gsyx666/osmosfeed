          "description": "更新 Linux 系统并没有那么复杂，不是吗？毕竟，要更新 Ubuntu 之类的发行版，你只需要使用 apt update 和 apt upgrade 就行。\n\r\n如果所有的包都是通过一个包管理器安装的，就会是这样。\n\r\n但现在情况不再如此。你有经典的 apt/dnf/pacman，还有 Snap、Flatpak、Appimages。不止于此，你还可以使用 PIP（用于 Python）和 Cargo（用于 Rust）安装应用。\n\r\n使用 Node？ NPM 包需要单独更新。Oh My Zsh？需要单独更新。Vim 中的插件、Atom 等也可能不被 apt/dnf/pacman 覆盖。\n\r\n你现在看到问题了吗？这就是名为 Topgrade 的新工具旨在解决的问题。\n\r\nTopgrade：处理各种更新的单一程序\n\r\nTopgrade 是一个 CLI 程序，它会检测你使用的工具，然后运行适当的命令来更新它们。\n\r\n\n\r\n除了通常的 Linux 包管理器，它还可以检测和更新 Brew、Cargo、PIP、Pihole、Vim 和 Emacs 插件、R 软件包等。你可以在 维基页面 上查看支持的包列表。\n\r\nTopgrade 的主要特点：\n\r\n\r\n能够更新来自不同的包管理器的软件包，包括固件！\n\r\n你可以如何控制更新包。\n\r\n高度可定制。\n\r\n甚至能够在更新包之前进行概览。\n\r\n\r\n所以不要浪费任何时间，让我们跳到安装。\n\r\n使用 Cargo 在 Linux 中安装 Topgrade\n\r\n安装过程非常简单，因为我将使用 Cargo 包管理器。\n\r\n我们已经有了 详细指南，其中包含设置 Cargo 包管理器的多种方法。所以我将在我的示例中使用 Ubuntu 来快速完成。\n\r\n因此，让我们以最少方式安装依赖项以及 Cargo：\n\r\nsudo apt install cargo libssl-dev pkg-config\r\n\n\r\n安装 Cargo 后，使用给定的命令安装 Topgrade：\n\r\ncargo install topgrade\r\n\n\r\n它会抛出一个警告：\n\r\n\n\r\n你只需添加 cargo 路径即可运行二进制文件。这可以通过给定的命令来完成，你需要使用你的用户名替换 sagar：\n\r\necho 'export PATH=$PATH:/home/sagar/.cargo/bin' >> /home/sagar/.bashrc\r\n\n\r\n现在，重启系统，Topgrade 就可以使用了。但是等等，我们需要安装另一个包来更新 Cargo 以获取最新的包。\n\r\ncargo install cargo-update\r\n\n\r\n这样我们完成了安装。\n\r\n使用 Topgrade\n\r\n使用 Topgrade 非常简单。使用一个命令，就是这样：\n\r\ntopgrade\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n但这不会给你除了系统包之外的任何控制，但正如我所提到的，你可以将不想更新的仓库列入黑名单。\n\r\n从 Topgrade 中排除包管理器和仓库\n\r\n假设我想排除 Snap 和从默认包管理器下载的包，所以我的命令是：\n\r\ntopgrade --disable snap system\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n要进行永久更改，你必须在其配置文件中进行一些更改，这些更改可以通过给定的命令访问：\n\r\ntopgrade --edit-config\r\n\n\r\n对于此示例，我排除了 Snap 和默认系统仓库：\n\r\n\n\r\n试运行 Topgrade\n\r\n评估将要更新的过时软件包总是一个好主意，我从 Topgrade 的整个目录中找到了这个最有用的选项。\n\r\n你只需使用带有 -n 选项的 topgrade 命令，它就会生成过期软件包的摘要。\n\r\ntopgrade -n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n检查需要更新的软件包的一种简洁方法。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n在使用 Topgrade 几周后，它成为了我的 Linux 武器库中不可或缺的一部分。 像大多数其他 Linux 用户一样，我只是通过我的默认包管理器更新包。 Python 和 Rust 包被完全忽略了。 感谢 Topgrade，我的系统现在完全更新了。\n\r\n我知道这不是每个人都想使用的工具。那你呢？愿意试一试吗？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/topgrade/\n\r\n作者：Sagar Sharma 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "谷歌 AI 引入了一个用于数组存储的高性能开源库 TensorStore。\n\r\n\r\n谷歌开发的开源 C++ 和 Python 框架 TensorStore 旨在加速大型多维数组的读写设计。覆盖单一大型坐标系的多维数据集通常用于当代计算机科学和机器学习应用程序中。使用这些数据集具有挑战性，因为客户经常希望进行涉及多个工作站并行操作的调查，并且可能会以不可预测的间隔和不同的规模接收和输出数据。\n\r\n谷歌研究院开发了 TensorStore，该库为用户提供了一个可以管理巨大数据集的 API，而无需复杂的硬件，以解决数据存储和操作问题。该库支持许多存储系统，包括本地和网络文件系统、谷歌云存储等。\n\r\n为了加载和处理大量数据，TensorStore 提供了一个简单的 Python API。任何任意大小的基础数据集都可以加载和更新，而无需将数据集完整存储在内存中，因为在需要精确切片之前不需要在内存中读取或保存实际数据。\n\r\n这是通过索引和操作语法实现的，它与 NumPy 操作的语法非常相似。除了虚拟视图、广播、对齐和其他复杂的索引功能，TensorStore 还支持如数据类型转换、降低取样和随意创建的数组这些功能。\n\r\n此外，TensorStore 包含一个异步 API，可以并发进行读取或写入操作。在执行其他工作时，软件可以进行内存缓存处理（可配置），从而减少在访问常用数据时处理较慢存储系统的需要。\n\r\n大型数值数据集需要大量的处理能力来检查和分析。实现这一点的常用方法是在分散在许多设备上的大量 CPU 或加速器内核之间并行化任务。在保持出色速度的同时并行分析单个数据集的能力一直是 TensorStore 的关键目标。 PaLM、脑图和其他复杂的大规模机器学习模型是 TensorStore 应用案例的一些例子。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/10/google-ai-unveils-a-new-open-source-library-for-array-storage/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：KevinZonda 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "相信对于很多小伙伴来说，Twitter并非单纯是一个“社交”平台，而是“信息获取”平台。通过追踪各类名人、机构的账号来了解所关注领域的最新动向。比如最近火热的NFT、Web3.0社区中就有大量的意见领袖在Twitter发声。\n然而从获取信息效率的视角来看，常规Twitter浏览界面并不是特别友好，时间线上有着各类广告，同时经常用着用着就发现自己迷失在几十个选项卡和搜索结果页中。如果你遇到过类似问题，并希望提高在Twitter获取信息的效率，我会强烈推荐Tweetdeck这个功能。\nTweetdeck是Twitter官方提供的在线工具，有模块化，高度自定义化的浏览界面，不仅适合专业的Twitter运营人员工作使用，也非常适合个人用户来改造优化自己的信息时间线。通过对比图片，可以很清楚的看到两种模式的差异。Tweetdeck可以在设置中选择 黑/白 两种显示模式，我个人更喜欢黑暗模式，看起来更轻松。\n4K显示器下的twitter常规界面，大量留白非常浪费空间4K显示器下的tweetdeck界面\n \n基础介绍\nTweetdeck和常规界面相比最重要的功能主要是3点：自动刷新、多列显示和自定义模块。自动刷新不需要过多解释，节省频繁刷新的操作和时间。自定义模块可以定制每一列种显示的内容，例如：\n\n我想单独查看Elon Musk的所有推特或者他直发的内容。 - 单用户模式\n我希望把多个账号归为一个主题，单独浏览，如：NBA球星们、实时股市新闻、NFT相关资讯。 - 清单模式\n我想追踪网友对正在发生的热点事件的评论，如：WWDC大会、俄乌冲突事件等 - 搜索模式\n\n多列显示则大幅度提升了屏幕利用率，让我们可以同时间追踪上述这些不同的主题。\n\n上图是我最近使用Tweetdeck的截图，我通过Vivaldi浏览器“垂直平铺”功能在右边放置了Tesla AI Day的视频直播，在左边放置了Tweetdeck，并添加了：“tesla ai day”搜索结果列、“tesla bot”搜索结果列、Elon的个人内容列，和常用的市场资讯列。\n \n模块选择\n在Tweetdeck中，可以选择添加多种不同的模块，其中包含，\n内容类模块：单用户模式、搜索模式、清单模式、正在流行内容等\n功能类模块：通知、站内信、@我的、已预约内容等\n我并没有做账户运营的需求，因此最常使用的还是：搜索结果、单个用户、多用户清单这几个内容类模块。\n可添加模块截图\n \n搜索模式：\n显示关键词搜索结果配合自动刷新功能，达成“直播”的效果。并且可以通过设置条件对搜索结果进一步筛选，可设置条件包含：\n\n按推文类型过滤：例如包含图片、视频、GIF等的推文；或者是否显示“转发”内容。\n筛选内容的发布时间范围，最小单位可以精确到半个小时。\n按照推文语言类型筛选，例如：中文、英文、日语等。\n筛选推文发布者：选择特定的单个用户或者一组用户的搜索结果。\n内容互动情况：显示至少有多少点赞、转发或评论的内容。\n\n \n单用户模式 & 多用户清单：\n这2个模式本质差别就是关注用户的多少，选定关注范围后的筛选条件选项完全一致。在这2个模块中，同样可以通过设置筛选条件，包含：\n\n按推文类型过滤：例如包含图片、视频、GIF等的推文；或者是否显示“转发”内容。\n关键词过滤：显示或排除包含指定关键词的内容。\n用户筛选：由指定用户发布的内容 或 @特定用户的内容。\n\n在Tweetdeck追踪的，不管是单用户还是清单，并不要求是关注的账户。这点非常贴心，也帮助我区分不同使用场景，我把大量“新闻资讯”类账号从关注列表中去除，放在Tweetdeck清单中，日常在手机上浏览就不会被刷屏，而更关注轻松的内容，坐在电脑前则可以追踪查看这些庞杂的资讯。\n在Tweetdeck创建的清单可以选择设置为公开或者私有列表，同时这个列表也会同步到常规界面左侧的列表按钮中。\n\n \n模块设置：\n这几个内容模块中都可以单独设置“媒体展示尺寸大小”，可以大体理解为模块中每一条内容的高度。以及是否通过“声音”或者“桌面通知”的形式发送通知，提示关注的内容有更新。\n\nTweetdeck是简单，但又很强大的工具，给我带来了很多的便利，也希望分享给大家，打造适合自己的内容模块。\n \nPS：\nTweetdeck访问地址：https://tweetdeck.twitter.com\n今年Twitter官方下架了Tweetdeck的桌面客户端软件，仅提供网页版本，如果想在电脑上安装独立客户端可以使用Tweeten，有Windows和Mac版本，并且基于Tweetdeck提供了更多的功能。\nTweeten部分功能展示\n题图源自：Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n更多内容欢迎访问我的个人博客：「假设检验」",

You can't avoid async programming to create a fast and reactive application. Applications with a high amount of file or network I/O or with a GUI that should always be reactive benefit tremendously from async programming. Tasks can be executed in the background while the user still makes inputs. Async programming is possible in many languages, each with different styles and syntax. Rust is no exception. In Rust, this feature is called async-await.\nWhile async-await has been an integral part of Rust since version 1.39.0, most applications depend on community crates.
